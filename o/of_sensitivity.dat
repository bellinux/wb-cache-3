This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation.

This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders.

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E

A hybrid system model which has a differential-algebraic-discrete (DAD) structure is proposed. This model forms the basis for the subsequent sensitivity analysis. Crucial to the analysis is the devel-opment of jump conditions describing the behavior <b>of</b> <b>sensitivities</b> at discrete events, such as switching and state resetting.

40|$|AIMS: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the recording <b>of</b> drug <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> elderly care home residents, to describe the nature <b>of</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and to identify and describe discrepancies in the documentation <b>of</b> drug <b>sensitivity</b> status in general practices, pharmacies and care homes. METHODS: A random sample of residents within a purposive sample of care homes (nursing and residential) was selected. A clinical pharmacist inspected the GP medical record, the medicines administration record, and the care home record for each resident to identify drug sensitivities and discrepancies between records and to describe the nature <b>of</b> the recorded <b>sensitivities.</b> RESULTS: The records of 121 residents in 31 care homes were studied. Thirty-one (26 %) residents had at least one documented drug <b>sensitivity</b> in one <b>of</b> the sources inspected, with 48 sensitivities in total recorded. There was no description of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>sensitivities</b> recorded in 39 / 48 (81 %) cases. The number <b>of</b> <b>sensitivities</b> recorded on the medicines administration record, care home record and the GP record were 3 (6 %), 29 (60 %) and 35 (73 %), respectively. Only two sensitivities were simultaneously recorded on all three records. CONCLUSIONS: It was of concern that over 90 % <b>of</b> drug <b>sensitivities</b> were not recorded on the medicines administration record which is the final checking document when administering medication. The reason for this was that the dispensing pharmacy was responsible for generating the medicines administration record; however, drug sensitivity status is seldom shared between the GP and the dispensing pharmacy.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{approaches}} to fluorescence tomography uti-lize {{some form of}} regularized nonlinear least-squares algorithm for data inversion, thus requiring repeated computation <b>of</b> the Jacobian <b>sensitivity</b> matrix relating changes in observable quan-tities, such as emission fluence, to changes in underlying optical parameters, such as fluorescence absorption. An exact adjoint formulation <b>of</b> these <b>sensitivities</b> comprises three terms, reflecting the individual contributions <b>of</b> 1) <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> diffusion and decay coefficients at the emission wavelength, 2) <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> diffusion and decay coefficients at the excitation wavelength, and 3) <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the emission source term. Simplifying linearity assumptions are computationally attractive in that they cause {{the first and second}} terms {{to drop out of the}} formulation. The relative importance of the three terms is thus explored in order to determine the extent to which these approximations introduce error. Computational experiments show that, while the third term <b>of</b> the <b>sensitivity</b> matrix has the largest magnitude, the second term becomes increasingly significant as target fluorophore concentration or volume increases. Image reconstructions from experimental data confirm that neglecting the second term results in overestimation <b>of</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and consequently overestima-tion of the value and volume of the fluorescent target, whereas contributions of the first term are so low that they are probably not worth the additional computational costs. Index Terms—Adjoint sensitivities, fluorescence tomography, Jacobian matrices, frequency domain photon migration. I...|$|R
