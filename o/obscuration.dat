5|$|Surface <b>obscuration</b> {{caused by}} yellow clouds had been {{noted in the}} 1870s when they were {{observed}} by Schiaparelli. Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907. In 1909, Antoniadi noted {{that the presence of}} yellow clouds was associated with the <b>obscuration</b> of albedo features. He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause of the clouds.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{transient}} lunar phenomena {{range from}} foggy patches to permanent {{changes of the}} lunar landscape. Cameron classifies these as (1) gaseous, involving mists {{and other forms of}} <b>obscuration,</b> (2) reddish colorations, (3) green, blue or violet colorations, (4) brightenings, and (5) darkening. Two extensive catalogs of transient lunar phenomena exist, with the most recent tallying 2,254 events going back to the 6th century. Of the most reliable of these events, at least one-third come from the vicinity of the Aristarchus plateau.|$|E
5|$|Not having {{expected}} such {{a determined}} {{resistance from the}} Nepalese, Colonel Sebright Mawbey, who was next {{in command of the}} British troops at Nalapani, retired to Dehra until 24 November so that heavy guns could arrive from Delhi. After the reinforcements had arrived, the fighting resumed on 25 November and for three days the fort was bombarded until, at noon on 27 November, a large section of northern wall finally gave away. The British forces, seeing their opportunity, twice tried to charge into the breach that day, but were repelled and pinned to an exposed position just outside the wall. An attempt was then made to fire one of the light guns into the breach to provide <b>obscuration</b> with gun smoke to cover a further attack, but that too proved unsuccessful. The day ended with the British assault force withdrawing after spending two hours pinned outside the wall, exposed to heavy fire from the garrison, and having suffered significant losses. British casualties for the day amounted to 37 dead and over 443 wounded.|$|E
25|$|According to Namkhai Norbu, {{all five}} of these, body (sku), voice (gsung), mind (thugs), qualities (yon tan), {{activities}} (phrin las), constitute a mindstream or 'continuum of being' of either a sentient being (with adventitious <b>obscurations)</b> or a buddha (without adventitious <b>obscurations).</b>|$|R

25|$|This eclipse {{was visible}} across Antarctica in its summer 24-hour day sunlight, and New Zealand near sunset {{with less than}} 20% of the Sun obscured. Parts of the western Antarctic Peninsula {{experienced}} nearly 90% <b>obscuration</b> of the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|The lamdré {{system is}} rooted in a very {{specific}} view, that the path and its result are contained within each other. All beings have an inherently enlightened nature; however, due to afflictive <b>obscurations,</b> they are prevented from recognizing this nature. The path to Buddhahood, then, aims at removing these <b>obscurations</b> and experiencing the liberated existence of nirvāṇa.|$|R
50|$|As {{a tool of}} exorcism, the kīla may be {{employed}} to hold demons or thoughtforms in place (once they have been expelled from their human hosts, for example) in order that their mindstream may be re-directed and their inherent <b>obscurations</b> transmuted. More esoterically, the kīla may serve to bind and pin down negative energies or <b>obscurations</b> from the mindstream of an entity, person or thoughtform, including the thoughtform generated by a group, project and so on, to administer purification.|$|R
5000|$|After being consecrated, {{the student}} then engages in the {{practices}} of the path. The path includes specific meditations and yogic exercises that aim to remove the adventitious <b>obscurations</b> that are the cause suffering. As with most Anuttarayoga Tantra systems, the Lamdré practitioner will engage in two stages of meditation, the creation stage (...) , where the meditator attempts to embody the awake nature of a buddha, and the completion stage (...) , which includes yogic meditations on {{various parts of the}} tantric anatomy. These practices directly purify <b>obscurations.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{dimensions of}} Maffei 1 depend strongly on the wavelength of light {{because of the}} heavy <b>obscuration</b> by the Milky Way. In blue light it is 1–2′ across while in the near infrared its major axis reaches 23′—more than 3/4 of the Moon's diameter. At a distance of 3Mpc this corresponds to approximately 23kpc. The total visible absolute magnitude of Maffei 1, MV=−20.8, is {{comparable to that of}} the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, one cannot {{know whether}} the gas in all Seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single, non-stellar {{continuum}} source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g. intense, nuclear starbursts. Spectropolarimetric studies reveal that only 50% of Seyfert 2s show a hidden broad-line region and thus split Seyfert 2 galaxies into two populations. The two classes of populations appear to differ by their luminosity, where the Seyfert 2s without a hidden broad-line region are generally less luminous. This suggests absence of broad-line region is connected to low Eddington ratio, and not to <b>obscuration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LTAS {{protection}} system follows an A-kit/B-kit principle, with vehicles designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection. Protection kits {{can be installed}} and uninstalled from vehicles in the field using only basic tools. The A-kit is fitted on the production line and {{is a combination of}} a limited amount of armoring, in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle, together with a significant amount of armor installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis. Two soldiers can install B-kit armor in five hours. An 800-pound RPG protection kit can be installed in two hours at field-level maintenance and completed by the crew within 30 minutes. The JLTV mounts up to four M7 Light Vehicle <b>Obscuration</b> Smoke Systems.|$|E
50|$|The end stage {{practice}} of the Mahayana removes the imprints of delusions, the obstructions to omniscience, which prevent simultaneous and direct knowledge of all phenomena. Only Buddhas have overcome these obstructions, according to Mahayana Buddhism, and, therefore, only Buddhas have omniscience knowledge. From the Mahayana point of view, an arhat who has achieved the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle will still have certain subtle <b>obscurations</b> that prevent the arhat from realizing complete omniscience. When these final <b>obscurations</b> are removed, the practitioner will attain nonabiding nirvana and achieve full omniscience.|$|R
5000|$|The kartika is used {{to symbolize}} the {{severance}} of all material and worldly bonds and is often crowned with a vajra, which is said to destroy ignorance, and thus leading to enlightenment. Another more nuanced interpretation says that [...] "the kartika represents the severing of the two Buddhist <b>obscurations</b> of defilements (klesha avarana) and knowledge (jneya avarana) that obstruct the path of enlightenment." [...] The kartika {{is also used to}} cut through human <b>obscurations</b> to progress on the spiritual path including [...] "pride, lack of belief, lack of devotion, distraction, inattention, and boredom." ...|$|R

25|$|Historically, work on radio-loud {{unification}} has {{concentrated on}} high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies {{in a manner}} directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of {{much in the way}} of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of <b>obscuration</b> from a torus, while quasars do not, although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources' large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and we see a blazar of some variety.|$|E
25|$|An {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) is {{a compact}} region {{at the center of}} a galaxy that has a much higher than normal {{luminosity}} over at least some portion—and possibly all—of the electromagnetic spectrum, with characteristics indicating that the excess luminosity is not produced by stars. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the radio, microwave, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy. The radiation from an AGN is believed to be a result of accretion of matter by a supermassive black hole at the center of its host galaxy. AGN are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe, and as such can be used as a means of discovering distant objects; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on models of the cosmos. The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the accretion disk, the degree of <b>obscuration</b> of the nucleus by dust, and presence or absence of jets. Numerous subclasses of AGN have been defined based on their observed characteristics; the most powerful AGN are classified as quasars.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it is not}} large, Coma Berenices {{contains}} one galactic supercluster, two galactic clusters, {{one star}} cluster and eight Messier objects (including several globular clusters). These objects can be seen with minimal <b>obscuration</b> by dust because the constellation {{is not in the}} direction of the galactic plane. Because of that, there are few open clusters (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse nebulae or planetary nebulae. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole at right ascension [...] and declination [...] (epoch J2000.0).|$|E
