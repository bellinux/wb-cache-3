These run {{as part of}} the normal build process and extensively exercise the interpreter and its core modules. Perl developers rely on the functional tests to ensure that changes to the interpreter do not introduce software bugs; additionally, Perl users who see that the interpreter passes its functional tests on their system can have a high degree <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> it is working properly.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

The inquiry, led by Senior Counsel Hugh Hartnett was criticised by Rossiter's family for its limited scope. Pat Rossiter expressed his lack <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> the inquiry would be permitted to ask if his son had been killed at the garda station, and if so, who was responsible. The family threatened not to participate. There was a disagreement over legal fees. McDowell, though, insisted that the inquiry would have full powers.|$|E

25|$|With {{the new car}} {{making its}} early debut at the Phillip Island round of the championship, after {{damaging}} the VL in a rollover at Symmons Plains Raceway, the team spent most of 1993 developing the VP into a race-winning package.

The Perkins Castrol Commodore, with its Holden V8 engine {{as opposed to the}} Chevrolet's run by the other leading Holden teams, was the fastest in all but one session during practice and qualifying. Perkins then cut a near perfect lap to claim his 2nd pole position in the race (Peter Brock set the pole time in 1983), and won after a race long battle with Jim Richards and Mark Skaife. Former motorcycle racer and longtime Allan Moffat co-driver Gregg Hansford had joined to team to co-drive at Sandown and Bathurst.|$|E

500|$|The first {{lawsuit was}} {{heard in the}} UK in October 1987 by Justice Vinelott. The litigants, the Church of Scientology of California, failed to obtain an {{injunction}} against {{the publication of the}} book. In his decision of 9 October 1987, the judge said that it was [...] "clear that the public interest far outweighed any duty <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>that</b> could conceivably be owed to Mr. Hubbard or his church." [...] The unpublished materials were held to be [...] "essential" [...] if Hubbard's early career was to be [...] "properly evaluated", and legal decisions against Armstrong in California could not bind an English court. The judge held that the Church had acted improperly in bringing its suit so late in the day. It had become aware in May of the plans to publish Bare-faced Messiah, but had not brought suit until 29 September, less than a month before publication. The application for an injunction, he said, [...] "was made at a time, whether calculated or not, when the greatest possible damage and inconvenience would be caused to Penguin Books". No satisfactory explanation had been made for the delay and, in the judge's view, the application [...] "was oppressive, and was not brought to protect any legitimate interest." ...|$|E
