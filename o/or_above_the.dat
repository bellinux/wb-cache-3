5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> points of impact.

The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E

5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E

5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E

In the 2015-2016 STAAR results, 79% of students in Klein ISD were at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Level II Satisfactory Standard, compared to 74% in surrounding Region 4, and 74% in the State of Texas. The Class of 2015 had an SAT average of 1498 and an average 22.7 ACT score, both higher than the Region 4 and State averages.

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> lumbar or sacral {{regions of the}} spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} private cottage {{schools in the}} area from a very early time, but Crompton's first public school was founded in 1791. In 1838, the Shaw National School was built. The {{construction}} of church schools followed, including Shaw Methodist School in 1842, St Mary's, in 1847 and St James' 1851. Shaw and Crompton is now served {{by a variety of}} schools, including some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> national average for test results. Crompton House Church of England School, a secondary school for 11- to 16-year-olds, also has a sixth form college of further education for 16- to 18-year-olds on the same site.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{suburb of}} Royton {{is served by}} a school of some kind, {{including}} some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either at <b>or</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> national average for test results. Royton has several primary schools, including St Annes, Thorp Primary School and S.s. Aidan and Oswalds Primary. Royton has two secondary schools, Royton and Crompton School and Our Lady's R.C. High School. Royton and Crompton is a coeducational, secondary comprehensive school for 11- to 16-year-olds. It has Science College status and was constructed in 1968. Our Lady's is a coeducational Roman Catholic high school and sixth form college for 11- to 19-year-olds. It was established in 1961 and specialialises in Mathematics and Computing. In the 2000s, Oldham Council and the Diocese of Salford agreed to merge Our Lady's with the St Augustine of Canterbury R.C. High School in Werneth. However, the proposal, which would have a newly built Catholic secondary on a new site in the 2010s, has been met with protest.|$|E
