5|$|By 1952, Kulikovsky {{had shrunk}} more than 4inches (10cm) from his peak height of 6ft 2inches (188cm). He distrusted {{conventional}} medicine and tried homeopathy instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
60|$|Yes, by the way, {{there was}} another sound. It {{proceeded}} from the cabin where our three friends lay sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas.</b> <b>The</b> sound was that of snoring, and it issued from the wide-open mouth of Sam Sorrel, who lay sprawling on his back, with Tittles coiled up at his feet.|$|R
60|$|Aileen and Miss Pritty, in <b>the</b> meantime, lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> in <b>the</b> cabin, {{and at last}} {{obtained}} much-needed refreshment {{to their}} weary spirits by falling into deep, dreamless, and untroubled slumber.|$|R

5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it would turn into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E

As Imogen switches off the TV, the play ends.|$|E
25|$|With this {{commission}} Manon, the third trophy, {{slipped out of}} the room, as untouched as she had come; her errand didn't seem to trouble her. I was greatly relieved at the thought that nothing could touch her, that she would always remain as she was and never become like her mother, the poisoner on the wall, the glassy, blubbery old woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks {{they are in the}} bathroom, and {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and simply urinating {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|E

Up to two contestants could be seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> silver <b>sofa</b> at any time. The goal of the contestants were to be seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> silver <b>sofa</b> by <b>the</b> {{end of the week}} so that they would be guest performers in next week's show, and thereby granted immunity from this week's and next week's elimination round.|$|R
25|$|Rebus {{finds himself}} {{with a number of}} {{problems}} on his hands. His wayward brother, Michael, has returned to Edinburgh in need of accommodation - with only the box-room in Rebus's flat available. While out drinking, he meets an old army friend, Deek Torrance, who admits to being involved in shady activities, telling Rebus he can get his hands on 'anything from a shag to a shooter'. Rebus spends so long out with Deek that he misses dinner with his girlfriend, Doctor Patience Aitken. Furious, she locks him out of her flat, forcing him to sleep in his own flat, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Hassan {{decided to}} leave Hollyoaks. Her {{departure}} was a mutual decision made between herself and the producers. She intended to leave in August 2012, but to facilitate the storyline {{she had to leave}} early. Hassan recalled the scenario of filming her final scenes a mere three days prior to her character's on-screen exit. Hassan's departure was not announced and the producers managed to keep Lynsey's exit a secret until transmission of E4's first look edition of the 28 June 2012 episode. This was done to ensure that viewers were taken by surprise. In the episode, Brendan was seen returning home to find Lynsey dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E

500|$|... "Because" [...] was {{inspired}} by Lennon listening to Ono playing Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Moonlight Sonata" [...] on the piano. He recalled he was [...] "lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in our house, listening to Yoko play... Suddenly, I said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them." [...] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to {{be some of the}} hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track.|$|E
500|$|... "It's an {{illusion}} to believe himself {{active in the}} story. Does he think he's changing something, watching news programmes, or {{lying on his back}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> on Sunday afternoon, reading more opinion columns of ungrounded certainties, more long articles about what really lies behind this or that development, or what is surely going to happen next, predictions forgotten as soon as they are read, well before events disprove them?" [...] Physically, Perowne is neither above nor outside the fray but at an angle to it; emotionally his own intelligence makes him apathetic, he can see both sides of the argument, and his beliefs are characterised by a series of hard choices rather than sure certainties.|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} month, the {{production}} began falling behind schedule. Much of the delay {{was due to}} Belushi's partying and carousing. When not on the set, {{he went out to}} his familiar Chicago haunts such as Wrigley Field and the Old Town Ale House. People often recognized him and slipped him cocaine, a drug he was already using heavily on his own, hoping to use it with him. [...] "Every blue-collar Joe wants his John Belushi story," [...] said Smokey Wendell, who was eventually hired to keep it away from the star. As a result of his late nights and drug and alcohol use, Belushi would often miss unit calls (the beginning of a production day) or go to his trailer after them and sleep, wasting hours of production time. One night, Aykroyd found him crashing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> of a nearby house, where Belushi had already helped himself to food in the refrigerator.|$|E

60|$|They {{dispersed}} {{about the}} room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of {{a flock of}} white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.|$|R
500|$|The Flukeman {{character}} has also attracted positive criticism. Writing for Den of Geek, John Moore listed the Flukeman {{as one of}} his [...] "Top 10 X-Files Baddies", writing that [...] "the idea of a man size biter running around drains in a city near me – looking like a giant, fanged maggot - was always likely to induce a goodly amount of cheek-shifting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> [...] " [...] The A.V. Clubs Zack Handlen described the flukeman as a [...] "beyond icky" [...] monster that [...] "just looks wrong", adding that [...] "the plain fact of its existence is horrifying enough that it doesn't need to do more". Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the character among the [...] "best" [...] monster-of-the-week, describing it as [...] "something of a poster boy for XF villains," [...] and considering that [...] "never has toxic waste seemed so dangerous as when the big slimy white fellow slithers onto the screen and starts attacking people in the sewers." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} verse, Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces, some joyful {{while others are}} more tense as Lewis is sad. The couple are then seen leaving the party; Haynes walks over to Lewis and attempts to kiss, but she proceeds to push him away. During the second airing of the chorus, more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears. At the breakfast that follows, the couple break {{into a series of}} arguments. Lewis shoves Haynes onto the sofa, and Haynes grabs Lewis as she turns away. Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face. During the middle eight breakdown in the song, [...] Haynes throws books from a shelf, and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion, as well as pushing over a lamp. Haynes subsequently leaves, driving away into the distance, and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears.|$|E
500|$|A week later, Tom lies in bed, {{smoking and}} writing. Gerri enters the room, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that Tom has left his job. She has been rehearsing in Portsmouth and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play Scrabble with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has [...] "no right" [...] to judge him. Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying [...] "Thank you, Grandma!" [...] and taking the £10 that Tom's grandmother sent. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for The Body Shop. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Now {{this garden}} {{belonged to the}} Caliph. In {{the middle of it}} was a vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each window having a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there. Only the door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim, who had strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted, and never to allow any one to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> by <b>the</b> door. It {{happened}} that evening that he had gone out on an errand. When he came back and saw two persons asleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> he was about to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceived that they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman, and decided to awake them by gentler means. Noureddin, on being awoke, told the old man that they were strangers, and merely wished to pass the night there. [...] "Come with me," [...] said Scheih Ibrahim, [...] "I will lodge you better, and will show you a magnificent garden belonging to me." [...] So saying the doorkeeper led the way into the Caliph's garden, the beauties of which filled them with wonder and amazement. Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to Scheih Ibrahim said, ...|$|R
