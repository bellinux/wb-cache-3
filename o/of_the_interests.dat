5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
40|$|Decision models under {{uncertainty}} {{need to be}} feeded with scenarios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rate curve. Such scenarios have to comply, {{as close}} as possible, with <b>the</b> empirical distribution <b>of</b> each rate. Simulation models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term structure usually assume that <b>the</b> conjugate distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rates is lognormal. Dynamic models, like vector auto-regression, implicitly postulate that <b>the</b> logarithm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rates is normally distributed. Statistical analyses have, however, shown that stationary transformations (yield changes) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rates are substantially leptokurtic, thus posing serious doubts on <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> available models. We propose in this paper a vector autoregressive model to simulate term structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rates with arbitrary marginals. We will show that our model is able to simulate paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire term structure with distributional properties very close {{to those found in}} the empirical data...|$|R

5|$|Their {{painting}} styles {{evolved from}} the formal Neoclassical approach of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen to embrace the evolving European trends in Realism and Impressionism, including the plein air approach adopted by the Barbizon School. The artists were especially attracted by the opportunities for painting en plein air, focusing on {{the activities of the}} local fishermen and their modest cottages. In the absence of any rules within the colony, the painters freely developed their individual styles. Nevertheless, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> they shared was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, whether playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
