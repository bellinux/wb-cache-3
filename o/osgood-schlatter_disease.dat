25|$|During {{adolescence}} Johnson was {{afflicted with}} <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> in both knees {{that kept him}} from participating in high school sports for the most part. During his junior high years he excelled in track, touch football and was on a Kiwanis basketball team for two years. In elementary school he played organized Little League baseball and had some familiarity with boxing.|$|E
25|$|When Mark was 16, he grew {{around one}} foot in one year. It was a relief, {{because he had been}} {{diagnosed}} with the repetitive stress injury <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> at 15, and told that he would not grow any further than his then height of 152cm. The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for Sydney Croatia in the state league and the pair were paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.|$|E

5000|$|Non-articular: This group {{includes}} Sever's disease (of the calcaneus, or heel), and Kienbock's {{disease of the}} hand, and other conditions not completely characteristic of the osteochondrosis, such as <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease</b> (of the tibial tubercle) and Osteochondritis dissecans.|$|R
40|$|Most {{patients}} with <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease</b> (OSD) have symptomatic relief from conservative treatment (activity modification, rest, ice, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) (SOR: B, prospective cohort and case series). Surgical treatment is rarely required, {{but may be}} beneficial in skeletally mature {{patients with}} symptoms despite conservative measures (SOR: C, case series) ...|$|R
50|$|With {{rest and}} {{quadriceps}} flexibility exercises the condition settles with no secondary disability. Sometimes, if the condition does not settle, calcification {{appears in the}} ligament. This condition is comparable to <b>Osgood-Schlatter’s</b> <b>disease</b> and usually recovers spontaneously. If rest fails to provide relief, the abnormal area is removed and the paratenon is stripped.|$|R
25|$|Hendrick joined The Rams {{as a youth}} {{player from}} St Kevin's Boys in Dublin, having {{overcome}} <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> and played regularly for the club's academy side before breaking into the reserve team during the 2009–10 campaign. He made one start and seven substitute appearances as the club's reserve side successfully captured the 2009–10 Central League Central Section title. At {{the end of the}} season his first involvement with the Derby County first team came on 2 May 2010 as he was an unused substitute in a 2–0 victory over Cardiff City in the final match of the 2009–10 season. A few weeks later, on 8 July 2010, he signed his first professional contract, alongside four other Derby County academy graduates, including fellow Republic of Ireland Youth international Ryan Connolly.|$|E
50|$|Its {{insertion}} on the tibia is {{the location}} of <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> {{results from}} {{stress on the}} {{epiphyseal}} plate in the tibia, leading to excess bone growth and a painful lump at the knee.|$|E
40|$|Limp {{and pain}} are common {{findings}} about the hip and knee in growing children. Epiphyseal growth peculiarities in children account {{for many of}} the specific disease entities. Simple but specific physical examination and mandatory simple X-rays will virtually always give or exclude a diagnosis. problems about the hip are usually serious, for example Legg-Perthes, slipped epiphysis and septic arthritis. Most childhood knee problems are annoying but not serious. Chondromalacia patellae and <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease</b> seldom require treatment—but the knee is the most common site for osteogenic sarcoma...|$|R
50|$|A tibial {{tuberosity}} avulsion fracture is {{an incomplete}} or complete {{separation of the}} tibial tuberosity from the tibia. This {{occurs as a result}} of a violent contraction of the quadriceps muscles, most often {{as a result of a}} high-power jump. Incomplete fractures are usually treatable with the traditional RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) method, but complete/displaced fractures will most often require surgery to pin the tuberosity back in place. Tibial tuberosity avulsions occur most often in teenagers that engage in a large amount of sporting activities, and many studies have shown a history with <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease</b> to be linked to the fracture.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a periosteal {{chondroma}} of the proximal tibia in an 11 -year-old girl, which was initially misdiagnosed as <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease.</b> The absence of pain and meticulous analysis of the imaging findings on initial and follow-up plain radiographs, ultrasound and MRI allowed to suggest the diagnosis of a periosteal chondroma, which was confirmed after biopsy. Besides the difficulty in the imaging diagnosis of the lesion, determination of the optimal treatment strategy may be challenging as well. Given the localization of this lesion close to the growth plate, decision has to be made whether the lesion will be treated surgically or a waitful watching policy will be implemented in order to prevent interference with the normal growth of the bone...|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of patellofemoral pain syndrome {{is made by}} ruling out patellar tendinitis, prepatellar bursitis, plica syndrome, Sinding-Larsen and Johansson syndrome, and <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{syndrome}} {{may develop}} without trauma or other apparent cause; however, some studies report up to 50% of patients relate {{a history of}} precipitating trauma. Several authors have tried to identify the actual underlying etiology and risk factors that predispose <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> and postulated various theories. However, currently it is widely accepted that <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> is a traction apophysitis of the proximal tibial tubercle at the insertion of the patellar tendon caused by repetitive micro-trauma. In otherwords, <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> is an overuse injury and {{closely related to the}} physical activity of the child. It was shown that childrenwho actively participate in sports are affected more frequently as compared with non-participants. In a retrospective study of adolescents, old athletes actively participating in sports showed a frequency of 21% reporting the syndrome compared with only 4.5% of age-matched nonathletic controls.|$|E

40|$|Osteochondroses are {{disorders}} {{of primary}} and secondary growth centres, or lesions at the apophyseal or epiphyseal growth areas of bones. Although there are many types of osteochondroses, the history, clinical symptoms and findings as well as radiological findings are typical. Physical exercise {{is one of the}} factors that provokes symptoms. In a series of 185 osteochondroses in active young athletes, there were 18 different disorders. The commonest were <b>Osgood-Schlatter's</b> <b>disease,</b> Sever's disease, osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles, various other patellar osteochon-droses and Scheuermann's disease. Most of the athletes were from individual events; track and field sports (53. 5 %), cross-country skiing (8. 1 %), gymnastics (3. 2 %) and power events (2. 7 %). Of the team sports soccer produced the most (20. 0 %). The treatment was conservative in 84. 3 % and operative in 15. 7 %. The duration of symptoms in these athletes persisted in about 43 % for less than one year and in 57 % for more. The late changes of osteochondroses do not cause serious risks for a normal life, if the treatment is active and the follow-up efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{syndrome}} of pain, swelling, and tenderness {{over the}} tibial tuberosity in children at time age of puberty with separation, fragmentation, and sclerosis of the tibia! timberosity and overlying soft-tissue swelling {{visible in the}} roentgeno-gram was first and independently reported as a pathological process by Osgood in the United States and by Schlatter in Germany in 1903. Both believed that traunma to time tibial tuberosity, {{either directly or indirectly}} by the pull of the patellar tendon, was time etiological factor and that partial or complete avulsion of the growing tibia! tuberosity occurred. Both authors described changes other than acute fracture or acute avulsion of time tibia! tuberosity which had been reported previously in the literature. Since 1903 time exact etiology of <b>Osgood-Schlatter’s</b> <b>disease</b> has been ques-tioned. The following causes imave been suggested in the literature, according to Aegerter and Kirkpatrick and King: (1) trauma to the tuberosity, with frac-ture; (2) trauma to the tuberosity, with aseptic necrosis; (3) trauma to the tuberosity, with inflammation; (4) localized infection in the tuberosity; (5 arterial embolism with aseptic necrosis of time tuberosity; (6) rickets; (7) toxic cimanges; (8) endocrine abnormalities; (9) developmental changes; and (10) traumatic changes in time lower part of time patellar tendon. Among time roentgenographic examinations of the knee made in the United States Arnmy Hospital, Ryukyu Islands, it was observed that there were wide variations in time roentgenographic appearance of the tibial tuberosity. Because of timis observation a study was initiated to clarify the significance of timese variations...|$|R

50|$|<b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> (OSD), {{also known}} as apophysitis of the tibial tubercle, is {{inflammation}} of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity. It {{is characterized by a}} painful bump just below the knee that is worse with activity and better with rest. Episodes of pain typically lasts a few months. One or both knees may be affected and flares may reoccur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> causes pain in {{the front}} {{lower part of the}} knee. This is usually at the ligament-bone {{junction}} of the patellar ligament and the tibial tuberosity. The tibial tuberosity is a slight elevation of bone on the anterior and proximal portion of the tibia. The patellar tendon attaches the anterior quadriceps muscles to the tibia via the knee cap.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> {{generally}} {{occurs in}} {{boys and girls}} aged 9-16 coinciding with periods of growth spurts. It occurs more frequently in boys than in girls, with reports of a male-to-female ratio ranging from 3:1 to as high as 7:1. It {{has been suggested that}} difference is related to a greater participation by boys in sports and risk activities than by girls.|$|E
50|$|Born in Cork, County Cork, Ireland {{started his}} career in Cobh, playing junior {{football}} for Cobh Ramblers, a team his father Michael had previously played for. As a schoolboy, Ireland had trials {{with a number of}} British clubs, though several were discouraged by his <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> which he suffered from in his mid-teens. He eventually chose Manchester City, where he moved in August 2001, as a fifteen-year-old.|$|E
50|$|James {{was educated}} at Packwood Haugh School near Ruyton-XI-Towns, {{and then at}} The King's School, Chester. He was a keen sportsman and played {{football}} and rugby before being diagnosed with <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> forcing him to switch to rowing instead. While at King's, he was schoolmates and shared a boat with fellow Olympian Chris Bartley. He went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 2002, obtaining his undergraduate degree in engineering in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Semple began {{gymnastics}} {{training at}} the age of 10. Her dream was to compete in Olympics gymnastics events. However, she was found to have <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> a childhood condition in which the bones grow faster than the muscles they support. This, along with the financial burden associated with training, ended her dream of Olympic competition. The severe injuries she suffered in an auto accident on May 23, 1983 meant she had to give up gymnastics entirely.|$|E
50|$|Sinding-Larsen and Johansson syndrome, {{named after}} Swedish surgeon Sven Christian Johansson (1880-1959), and Christian Magnus Falsen Sinding-Larsen (1866-1930), a Norwegian physician, is an {{analogous}} condition to <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> involving the patellar tendon {{and the lower}} margin of the patella bone, instead of the upper margin of the tibia, {{as is the case}} in Osgood-Schlatter. This variant was discovered in 1908, during a winter indoor Olympic qualifier event in Scandinavia. Sever's disease is a similar condition affecting the heel.|$|E
50|$|Jegede {{grew up in}} Hackney as the {{youngest}} of four children. He had a rough upbringing, going {{through a number of}} evictions when his mother was not able to pay rent. He was named after a character in the television show Sons and Daughters. He attended Barking Abbey School. He wanted to become a professional footballer and was offered trials at Norwich and Tottenham Hotspur, but at the beginning of secondary school he was diagnosed with <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> which stopped him from playing.|$|E

[...] He expected to retire from the sport after the Olympics, but continues to jump in Masters athletics events into his 60s. He has held several Masters World Records as he has passed through the age groups. In 2009, small gust of wind is all that prevented him from equalling the M60 world record.|$|E
50|$|When Cranston was 13, he {{developed}} <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> and was initially {{told that he}} would never skate again. After eight weeks in a cast, he resumed training, and won the 1964 Canadian Junior Championship the next month. In the next few years, however, Cranston met with little success at the senior level. As he was dividing his attention with art school at this time, his physical conditioning was poor and he struggled to make it through his programs, which at that time were 5 minutes for senior men.|$|E
50|$|Margalik began skating in 2005. His first {{coach was}} Robert O'Toole, who taught him for eight years, mainly at the Woodbine Winter Club in Toronto. Margalik's early career was {{hindered}} by <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease,</b> which affected his knees. Competing on the junior level, {{he won the}} silver medal at the 2013 Canadian Championships and gold at the 2013 Mladost Trophy, his only international appearance for Canada. He changed coaches later in 2013, joining Andrei Berezintsev and Inga Zusev at the Richmond Training Centre in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

Despite battling very painful tendinitis in both ankles and <b>Osgood-Schlatter</b> <b>disease</b> during pre-Olympic training, Dawes performed respectably throughout the competition, even having the boldness to try a brand-new move in her balance beam routine during team competition - back handspring to three layout stepouts. She also won over the crowd with a solid optional floor exercise routine and, with a mark of 9.925, tied with Kim Zmeskal for the highest score for the American team on the event. The team won bronze, and Dawes and teammate Betty Okino became the first African American females to win an Olympic-gymnastics medal.|$|E
