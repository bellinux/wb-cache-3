40|$|The gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> two radiolabelled pancake meals of {{identical}} composition, but different consistency, was {{compared with the}} rates at which they could be broken down in vitro by mechanical agitation in a solution of either acid-pepsin or saline. Neither of the pancake meals were broken up within 150 minutes by mechanical agitation in a normal saline medium, but both were disrupted {{in the presence of}} acid-pepsin, the light consistency pancake being broken up more rapidly than the heavy consistency pancake (0. 5 +/- 0. 1 v 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 % radioactivity appearing in the bathing medium per minute, p less than 0. 01). Under normal conditions, the pattern and rate <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both meals was similar. Stimulating acid secretion with pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg bodyweight sc) delayed the onset <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both pancakes and tended to increase the slope <b>of</b> <b>emptying.</b> Under these conditions, the denser pancake was emptied more slowly than the lighter pancake because of an increase in the lag period. Thus the data did not confirm the hypothesis that the rate <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> disruptible solid food from the stomach under normal conditions of acid secretion is influenced by the ease with which it can be broken down by mechanical agitation in an acid-pepsin medium. The trend for an accelerated rate <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> after administration <b>of</b> pentagastrin, however, may well be explained by the increased rate of disruption of the food in the presence of acid, but the longer lag periods are more compatible with inhibition <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> caused by free acid in the duodenum...|$|R

In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact.

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation <b>of</b> (<b>empty)</b> preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E

5|$|Following long-standing custom {{for a city}} {{taken by}} storm, the plundering of the city lasted for three days. Over seven {{thousand}} Thessalonians were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, Đurađ Branković. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in the sack, particularly the cathedral of Hagios Demetrios, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which became the city's first mosque. The Sultan then restored order and took measures to revive the city, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold as slaves; only 2,000 {{of the population was}} left after the sack, many of which soon converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from the sack himself. He also brought in Muslim and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques.

Gastric emptying was measured for 16 days after the production of VMH lesions in rats maintained either ad libitum or on restricted eating.
