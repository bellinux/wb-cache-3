40|$|This {{interesting}} {{paper by}} Dr. Hodge [l] presents {{the thesis that}} variations in rawinsonde ascent rate can be utilized to delineate areas of clear air turbulence. The reader {{may be interested in}} a slightly different treatment of these same data (turbulence reports and rawinsonde ascents for November 8 - 10, 1963), which were made available through the kindness of Dr. Hodge. Following Dr. Hodge, the rawinsonde ascent rate was estimated at 2000 -ft. intervals from the aneroid. The change in ascent rate for successive 2000 -ft. layers was compared‘with the mean ascent rate for the entire flight, and a ratio was formed. These ratios were smoothed by forming <b>overlapping</b> <b>averages</b> of three with respect to height, and then graphed as a function of height.

A frequency domain eigensystem realization algorithm, via transfer functions, is developed using a known procedure formulated {{for a time}} domain eigensystem realization algorithm, via free decay measurement data. An important feature is the capability of windowing to concentrate analysis on the frequency range of interest. The procedure of <b>overlap</b> <b>averaging</b> is used to produce smoother spectra to reduce the effect of noise on identified modal parameters.

The maximal horizontal <b>overlap</b> <b>averaged</b> 42. 7 ° in females and 52. 4 ° in males; females had only one overlap maximum, whereas males had two. In the dorsoventral direction, the binocular field had an overlap of 135. 2 ° in the female and 142 ° in the male. In light-adapted eyes, optical acceptance angles reached values of 2. 0 °, and they reached 3. 6 ° with dark adaptation; interommatidial angles were between 1. 8 ° and 2. 3 °. The angles were very similar over the entire eye; no acute zone {{was found in the}} frontal part of the eye, as the large binocular overlap would suggest.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{necessary to determine}} {{the manner in which}} materials and structures deteriorate with respect to time when subjected to sustained random dynamic loads. In such cases a system's fatigue characteristics can be obtained by continuously monitoring its modal parameters. This allows for any structural deterioration, often manifested as a loss in stiffness, to be detected. Many common structural integrity assessment techniques make use of Fourier analysis for modal parameter extraction. For continual modal parameter extraction, the Fourier transform requires that a compromise be made between the accuracy of the estimates and how frequently they can be obtained. The limitations brought forth by this compromise can be significantly reduced by selecting suitable values for the analysis parameters, mainly subrecord length and number of averages. Further improvements may also be possible by making use of spectral enhancement techniques, specifically <b>overlapped</b> <b>averaging</b> and zero padding. This paper uses the statistical analysis of results obtained from numerous physical and numerical experiments to evaluate the influence of the analysis parameters and spectral enhancement techniques on modal estimates obtained from limited data sets. This evaluation will assist analysts in selecting the most suitable inputs for parameter extraction purposes. The results presented in this paper show that when using the Fourier transform to extract modal characteristics, any variation in the parameters used for analysis can have a significant influence on the extraction of natural frequency estimates from systems subjected to random excitation. It was found that for records containing up to 10 % noise, subrecord length; hence spectral resolution, has a more pronounced influence on the accuracy of modal estimates than the level of spectral averaging; therefore spectral uncertainty. It was also found that while zero padding may not increase the actual spectral resolution, it does allow for improved natural frequency estimates with the introduction of interpolated estimates at the nondescribed frequencies. Finally, it was found that for modal parameter extraction purposes (in this case natural frequency), increased amounts of <b>overlapped</b> <b>averaging</b> can significantly reduce the variance of the estimates obtained. This is particularly useful as it allows for increased precision without compromising temporal resolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} {{measurement}} errors in-volved in estimating frequency response functions (FRFs) —and related quantities {{such as the}} coherence function—from weighted <b>overlapped</b> segment <b>averaging,</b> a technique {{that has become a}} standard in modern data analyzers due to its computational ad-vantages. Particular attention is paid to leakage errors, for which this technique has frequently been criticized. Our main result is that a half-sine or diff window with about 2 / 3 overlap achieves the best compromise to reduce leakage errors in the case of stationary random excitations, and this is independently of the system FRF. This conclusion is to be contrasted with the customary habit of using a Hanning window with 1 / 2 overlap. The same reasoning confirms that a rectangular window without overlap minimizes measurement errors in the special case of multisine excitations. Moreover, practical formulas are provided to the reader for computing the bias and variance of the frequency response and coherence functions in the general case.

Figure 4 shows two profiles which compare the fused DEM with the source DEMs. The profile of the fused DEM seamlessly transitions from the profile of one DEM to the other. Due to the spatially variable overlap width, the length of the transition zone differs for each profile (3.6 meters and 4.8 meters for profiles 1 and 2 respectively).|$|R
30|$|The {{magnitude}} squared coherence {{is determined}} using the “mscohere” subroutine in MATLAB. Filtered time sequence data from two separate pixel locations are inputs to the subroutine. The sampling frequency {{is also an}} input to the “mscohere” subroutine. This subroutine uses Welch’s <b>Overlapped</b> Segment <b>Averaging</b> procedure. Use of this procedure requires input information related to window type, window size, and size of <b>overlapped</b> region. The <b>averaging</b> scheme employs Hanning windowing. The window size is equivalent to {{one quarter of the}} length of the filtered time sequence array of grayscale data. This is the same as a quarter of the number of shadowgraph flow visualization images acquired and analyzed. For example, there are 21, 620 images captured during the test on 05 April 2018, so each window consists of 5405 data points (21, 620 divided by 4). The default size of the overlapped region is also required. This default size is half {{of the size of the}} window length, rounded down. Hence, the windows overlap by 2702 data points.|$|R

The main wave propagation paths were modeled; quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse modes were coupled in each lamella {{and the sound}} field {{was found to be}} shifted from the insonification axis {{as a function of the}} ring angle, leading to interference of wave paths in the receiver and to 15 dB amplitude variability in defect-free glulam.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the phase transition of the 3 -coloring problem on random graphs, using the extremal optimization heuristic. 3 -coloring {{is among the}} hardest combinatorial optimization problems and {{is closely related to}} a 3 -state anti-ferromagnetic Potts model. Like many other such optimization problems, it has been shown to exhibit a phase transition in its ground state behavior under variation of a system parameter: the graph's mean vertex degree. This phase transition is often associated with the instances of highest complexity. We use extremal optimization to measure the ground state cost and the "backbone", an order parameter related to ground state <b>overlap,</b> <b>averaged</b> over a large number of instances near the transition for random graphs of size n up to 512. For graphs up to this size, benchmarks show that extremal optimization reaches ground states and explores a sufficient number of them to give the correct backbone value after about O(n^ 3. 5) update steps. Finite size scaling gives a critical mean degree value α_ c= 4. 703 (28). Furthermore, the exploration of the degenerate ground states indicates that the backbone order parameter, measuring the constrainedness of the problem, exhibits a first-order phase transition.

40|$|Abstract Leopards (Panthera pardus) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} large felid, yet comparatively {{little is known about}} their fine-scale movement patterns and how these affect the risks they face. There has been much debate on the conservation status and management needs for leopards with much extrapolation from limited data. In order to gather more information on leopard movements in Botswana’s Northern Tuli Game Reserve, seven leopards were collared between February 2005 and August 2006. This allowed key aspects that affect demography, and thus resilience to anthropogenic effects, to be investigated. Generally, home ranges were typical for breeding females in woodland savanna (32. 9 ± 7. 3 km²) with substantial <b>overlap</b> (<b>average</b> 26. 0 %). Core areas though were independent and extremely small (1. 9 ± 2. 2 km²). These were used primarily for young cub rearing, and were characterized by rugged terrain along riverbeds. This highly localized use places leopards at potential risk of snaring as snares tend to be concentrated along these landscape features. Furthermore, hunters can conceal blinds from which to shoot leopards more easily in these areas. Further risk to adult female survival came from excursions outside the reserve boundary during which livestock was predated. Three incidences of cannibalism by adult territorial males on adult females are also reported, suggesting significant intra-specific competition...|$|R

To generate high-resolution transcriptomemaps, we developed an organizational schema {{which showed that}} in practice only three features are required to define operon architecture: the promoter, terminator, and deep RNA sequence read coverage. We pre-cisely annotated 2, 122 promoters and 1, 774 terminators, defining 1, 510 operons {{with an average of}} 1. 98 genes per operon. Our analyses revealed an unprecedented view of E. coli operon architecture. A large proportion (36 %) of operons are complex with internal promoters or terminators that generate multiple transcription units. For 43 % of operons, we observed differential ex-pression of polycistronic genes, despite being in the same operons, indicating that E. coli operon architecture allows fine-tuning of gene expression. We found that 276 of 370 convergent operons terminate inefficiently, generating complementary 3 = tran-script ends which <b>overlap</b> on <b>average</b> by 286 nucleotides, and 136 of 388 divergent operons have promoters arranged such that their 5 = ends <b>overlap</b> on <b>average</b> by 168 nucleotides.
