40|$|NPS R- 568 halts or reverses <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in uremic rats. <b>Osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> is {{a common}} bone injury {{associated}} with secondary hyperparathyroidism (2 °HPT). NPS R- 568 is a phenylalkylamine derivative that acts as an agonist at the cell-surface Ca 2 + receptor (“calcimimetic”) and inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. In the present study, we tested whether NPS R- 568 could ameliorate <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in partially nephrectomized (Nx) rats with 2 °HPT. Six months after surgery, Nx rats had developed mild but progressive 2 °HPT and <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> Two groups of Nx rats received NPS R- 568 (3 and 30 mg/kg body wt · day) by daily gavage for 30 days, {{which led to a}} dose-related decrease in serum PTH levels and to a marked reduction in peritrabecular fibrosis (0. 96 ± 0. 49 % to < 0. 1 %). Furthermore, 2 °HPT was associated with decreases in volumetric cortical bone mineral density (vCtBMD) and in cortical bone stiffness at the femoral midshaft. NPS R- 568 significantly restored the deficits in vCtBMD and stiffness. These results indicate that NPS R- 568 has beneficial effects on bones with <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> by normalizing serum PTH levels...|$|R

Changes of azotaemic renal osteodystrophy included <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> osteomalacia, and osteosclerosis. Quantitative histology using a point-counting technique revealed a significant increase in total bone, mineralized bone, and osteoid in comparison with a control group of 68 individuals. <b>Osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> due to secondary hyperparathyroidism occurred in 93 %, osteomalacia in 40 %, and osteosclerosis in 30 % of patients. Woven bone formation was a characteristic feature and was related to the severity of <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> There were significant correlations between the weights of parathyroid glands and the number of osteoclasts, amounts of woven bone, and marrow fibrosis in the ilium. Hyperparathyroidism caused degradation of mineralized bone but the loss was balanced or exceeded by the aggradation of woven mineralized bone. Woven bone formation together with excess osteoid gave rise to osteosclerosis.

500|$|<b>Osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> <b>cystica</b> ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E

In order to re-examine this issue, 25 uremic patients treated by intermittent hemodialysis underwent 99 m-Technetium Methylene Diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan. They were subdivided into three groups according to quantitative bone histology. Group 1 (N = 8) had pure dialysis osteomalacia, group 2 (N = 7) mixed lesions, and group 3 (N = 10) pure <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> The scintigraphic studies were interpreted {{by means of a}} five point semiquantitative scale. Using this quantification, all but one group 1 patients had decreased bone tracer uptake, and all patients of group 3 had an increased uptake (chi square test of Yates, P < 0. 001). Among patients of group 2, bone uptake was decreased in the three patients with clearly reduced mineralization front and moderate <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> but it was increased in all patients with severe <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> and subnormal mineralization front. A quantitative analysis of regional tracer uptake into bone was performed in two patients: one of group 2 and one of group 3. The results obtained clearly corroborated the semi-quantitative findings. Thus, in hemodialysis patients with symptomatic bone disease, the 99 mTc-MDP bone scan provides useful information for the differential diagnosis between dialysis–related osteomalacia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with mixed lesions, the importance of bone tracer uptake appears to depend on the extent of the mineralization front and on the intensity of <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Renal {{osteodystrophy}} {{includes the}} complete range of mineral metabolism disorders {{that affect the}} skeleton in patients with chronic renal failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 200 patients with end-stage renal disease and on dialysis were investigated regarding the clinical, biochemical and histological findings of bone disease. RESULTS: The spectrum of renal osteodystrophy consisted mainly of high turnover bone lesions (74. 5 %), including <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in 57. 5 %. Patients with mild bone disease were on dialysis for shorter periods of time and were mostly asymptomatic. Patients with aluminum-related bone disease (16. 5 %) had the greatest aluminum exposure, either orally or parenterally, and together with patients with high turnover mixed disease, were the most symptomatic. Although on a non-regular basis, {{the vast majority of}} the patients (82. 5 %) had been receiving vitamin D. The incidence of adynamic bone disease was high (n= 8) among parathyroidectomized patients (n= 12). Significantly higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed in <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of calcitriol and phosphate-binding agents on a non-regular basis seems to be the reason for the apparent reduced response to the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be a fair marker for bone turnover in patients with <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> The severity of the clinical manifestations of bone disease correlates with the histological features of bone lesion and to the time spent on dialysis...|$|R

Lack of mineralization and the development of <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> are thus associated with a marked increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. Osteoclasts reacted strongly for acid phosphatase but were negative for alkaline phosphatase.
