After a brief historical introduction, we focus on the general formalism of electromagnetic multipole expansion in condensed matter. We then introduce the anomalous scattering amplitude from perturbation theory in the low-energy limit of the Dirac Hamiltonian. Finally, we merge the two previous sections by showing how the anomalous scattering amplitude can be interpreted in terms of elec. and magnetic multipoles. Some examples are then discussed, concerning the elec. quadrupole in manganites, "exotic" polar and axial toroidal multipoles in transition-metal <b>oxides</b> and <b>polarization</b> anal. allowing the disentanglement of nearby-lying multipoles in the energy spectrum.

40|$|Electrically driven Er 3 + doped Si slot waveguides {{emitting}} at 1530 nm are demonstrated. Two different Er 3 + doped active layers were fabricated in {{the slot}} region: a pure SiO 2 and a Si-rich <b>oxide.</b> Pulsed <b>polarization</b> driving of the waveguides was used to characterize the time response of the electroluminescence (EL) and of the signal probe transmission in 1 mm long waveguides. Injected carrier absorption losses modulate the EL signal and, since the carrier lifetime is much smaller than that of Er 3 + ions, a sharp EL peak was observed when the polarization was switched off. A time-resolved electrical pump & probe measurement in combination with lock-in amplifier techniques allowed to quantify the injected carrier absorption losses. We found an extinction ratio of 6 dB, passive propagation losses of about 4 dB/mm, and a spectral bandwidth > 25 nm at an effective d. c. power consumption of 120 μW.

Transmission electron microscopy images revealed a 2 nm natural spacer layer at {{the interface between}} CFO and LSMO, which decoupled the two layers and permitted the observation of spin-valve effect. These heteroepitaxial spin-valve junctions showed positive magnetoresistive behavior, although CFO and LSMO are known to possess opposite spin polarization coefficients. We suggest that the abnormal magnetoresistive behavior originates from the change of spin polarization coefficient arising from the barrier layer. Our results demonstrated that naturally formed interfacial layers provide a simple route for fabricating all-oxide-based spin-valve junctions. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{orientation}} of small organic acid modifiers on metal oxide electrodes is important in advancing the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, {{the orientation}} {{of a group of}} these small organic acid modifiers will be investigated on indium zinc <b>oxide</b> (IZO). <b>Polarization</b> modulation-infrared reflectance-absorbance spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) is the primary technique used to determine these orientations. In order to determine orientations from PM-IRRAS data, other chemical and physical properties of the modifiers, such as density and surface coverage, must be experimentally determined. Neutral buoyancy is used to determine the density of the modifiers, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to estimate surface coverage of these modifiers on IZO. These techniques are also used to determine binding mode of these modifiers on IZO. The tilt angles (θ) were found to be 50 ± 3 °, 64 ± 2 °, and 43 ± 3 ° for F₅BnPA, F₅BnCA, and F₅BnHA, respectively, meaning that the phenyl ring in F₅BnHA is more perpendicular to the surface while the phenyl ring in F₅BnCA more parallel to the surface.

Formation of strongly adsorbed hydrogen does not cause structural changes but weakly adsorbed hydrogen as well as the adsorption of CO coordinated to single surface Pt-atoms and to more than one surface atom leads to the formation of two types of incommensurate surface layer, one close packed and the other expanded.

Open circuit potential values indicated {{that all the}} ZrNb alloys studied and the pure Zr undergo spontaneous passivation due to spontaneously formed oxide film passivating the metallic surface. It also indicated that the addition of increasing Nb contents to pure Zr seems to improve the protection characteristics of its spontaneous <b>oxides.</b> Potentiodynamic <b>polarization</b> curves showed an increase of the breakdown potential {{and the extent of}} the passive range following an increased niobium amount in the alloy. This leads to the conclusion that a progressive increase of niobium content positively affects the localized corrosion behaviour of the ZrNb alloys by enhancing the electrochemical stability of the passive film. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies showed high impedance values for all the samples, and its increase on increased niobium content in the alloy indicated an improvement in the corrosion resistance of the spontaneous oxide film. The fit obtained suggests a single passive film present on the metal surface, with resistance improving with the increase of niobium amount in the alloy. All these electrochemical results show the beneficial effect of increasing niobium contents on the passive state stability of the ZrNb alloys...|$|R

A brief review of the emission technique is given, along with a review of the chemical effects and Auger "after effects " that are as-sociated with this experimental method.

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} XANES (X-ray {{absorption}} near edge spectroscopy) studies during polarization of thin sputter-deposited Fe-oxide films in acidic solutions. The dissolution rate of Fe-oxides in acidic solutions {{was found to}} be strongly increased by the presence of Fe(2 +) in the <b>oxide.</b> During anodic <b>polarization</b> in acidic solutions, a deleterious effect of chloride anions is found compared with sulfates. In HCl solutions of increasing concentration, not only the pH decrease, but also the increasing anion concentration accelerates dissolution. On the other hand, the dissolution rate in sulfuric acid does not depend on the sulfate concentration. During cathodic polarization, the dissolution rate is not affected by the presence of chloride ions. This could be due to the negative surface charge of n-type oxides at potentials lower than the flat-band potential, retarding anion adsorption on the surface. These results suggest that the detrimental role of chloride anions on the stability of Fe oxide films is due to a surface complexation effect. The dissolution rate is fairly independent of the potential in the anodic range, except at very high anodic potentials. The XANES spectra reveal no changes in the average oxide valency during anodic polarization. Thus in the passive range, the dissolution that takes place is mostly chemical rather than electrochemical. The findings and their relevance to the stability of natural passive films are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{switching}} memory devices {{have been made}} by integrating a ferroelectric layer in the device. A Schottky diode consisting of a ferroelectric semiconductor and a high work function metal was found to show a bistable I-V behaviour. Experimentally an On/Off current ratio of two orders of magnitude was found in a structure consisting of a semiconducting PbTiO 3 layer with a gold top contact, grown on a La 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 CoO 3 bottom contact layer. The ferroelectric polarization parallel or antiparallel to the internal field of the diode gives rise to a change in the Schottky barrier height an depletion width. This will, depending on the polarization direction of the ferroelectric layer, enhance or diminish the tunnel probability of charge carriers through the Schottky barrier and thereby increase or decrease the current through the device. In the Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistor an insulating ferroelectric gate oxide was brought in direct contact to a gated n-type Sb-doped SnO 2 semiconducting channel layer. A maximum On/Off Source-Drain current (ISD) ratio at zero gate voltage of 5. 7 was found.

40|$|Magnetism of {{transition}} metal (TM) oxides is usually {{described in terms}} of the Heisenberg model, with orientation-independent interactions between the spins. However, the applicability of such a model is not fully justified for TM <b>oxides</b> because spin <b>polarization</b> of oxygen is usually ignored. In the conventional model based on the Anderson principle, oxygen effects are considered as a property of the TM ion and only TM interactions are relevant. Here, we perform a systematic comparison between two approaches for spin polarization on oxygen in typical TM oxides. To this end, we calculate the exchange interactions in NiO, MnO, and hematite (Fe 2 O 3) for different magnetic configurations using the magnetic force theorem. We consider the full spin Hamiltonian including oxygen sites, and also derive an effective model where the spin polarization on oxygen renormalizes the exchange interactions between TM sites. Surprisingly, the exchange interactions in NiO depend on the magnetic state if spin polarization on oxygen is neglected, resulting in non-Heisenberg behavior. In contrast, the inclusion of spin polarization in NiO makes the Heisenberg model more applicable. Just the opposite, MnO behaves as a Heisenberg magnet when oxygen spin polarization is neglected, but shows strong non-Heisenberg effects when spin polarization on oxygen is included. In hematite, both models result in non-Heisenberg behavior. General applicability of the magnetic force theorem as well as the Heisenberg model to TM oxides is discussed.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} inhaled nitric oxide on the systemic microcirculation. We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide improves the systemic microcirculation. Inhaled nitric oxide improves outcome in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn diagnosed by improving pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation.

Inhaled nitric oxide is also utilized {{in the treatment of}} acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in children and adults. It is thought to improve regional ventilation perfusion by regional selective pulmonary vasodilation. Pilot study. Intensive care unit of a level III university children's hospital. Consecutive ventilated patients who were treated with inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm) were enrolled in this study.

Carbon molecules like fullerenes (C 60) have been integrated in the MOS gate stack. Charge injection into molecular orbital has been observed as repeatable steps in electron injection versus charging voltage data to demonstrate a successful molecular interface with CMOS. Finally, an ultra-narrow channel memory device fashioned out of self ?assembled carbon nanotube (CNT) channel with self aligned metal nanocrystals is proposed as an alternative to memory scaling. The device demonstrates large memory window and single-electron sensitivity. The single electron sensitivity at room temperature is confirmed by analysis of the transport in the CNT channel using non-equilibrium Green?s function (NEGF) formalism. The large number of charges stored in the nanocrystal at sub- 5 V gate bias for the 100 nm gate stack is demonstrated experimentally and explained from the electrostatic analysis of the CNT-nanocrystal memory. The ability to store large number of charges per nanocrystal and the ability of sense each of these charge charges indicates the possibility of a multi-level memory, a way of enhancing functional density while relaxing conventional memory scaling constraints.

40|$|Eletrochemical {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on TiN and ZrN coated 304 stainless steels in 0. 5 N chloride containing solution to identify the effect of film thickness and Ti or Zr interlayer between TiN or ZrN coatings, respectively, on their corrosion properties. Time dependent corrosion behavior was monitored utilizing the widely used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The corrosion resistance values were justified by the polarization resistance obtained from linear polization. Active to passive transition behavior was studied utilizing the potentiodynamic cyclic polarization test. The charge transfer resistance values obtained from both EIS and linear polarization indicated higher corrosion resistance of ZrN coated steels than the TiN coated steels; justifying our previous findings. It was approximately 106 ohm. cm 2 for the former and 6 x 105 ohm. cm 2 for the latter. Higher resistance of ZrN coated steels was attributed to formation of a passive film on the coating. Increasing the film thickness from 5 to 10 μm and laying a metal interlayer between two coating layers did not significantly change the charge transfer resistance suggesting the mechanism for protection is dominated by surface phenomena like formation of an <b>oxide</b> film. Cyclic <b>polarization</b> scans indicated that the corrosion potential of ZrN coated steels was lower than the bare steel and that of TiN coated steels slightly higher than the bare steel. The critical current density for film formation was {{an order of magnitude}} lower for ZrN coated steels than TiN coated steels; approximately 10 - 3 for the former and 10 - 2 for the latter. This suggested easier formation of oxide film on ZrN than on TiN. The passive films were in the form of ZrO 2. 2 H 2 O for the former and TiO 2. H 2 O for the latter. Increasing the coating thickness and laying an interlayer between the coating layers increased the coating breakdown potential where pits formed. The higher corrosion resistance of ZrN was then attributed to the easier formation of oxide film on its surface as suggested by the lower critical current density for film formation. Formation of passive oxide film on ZrN was investigated utilizing electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). A layer of approximately 1000 Angstrom thick containing oxygen formed on the ZrN surface after exposure for more than 60 days. This layer was identified by ZrO 2 from the binding energy value of the core electron of Zr. It was suggested that this oxide existed in the hydrated form during exposure to aqueous environment but dehydrated after removal and exposure to a laboratory environment. A broad oxygen O 1 s peak suported this argument. However, insignificant change in the oxygen content was found for TiN exposed for more than 60 days. Oxide film formation on ZrN but not on TiN was proposed as driven by the potential difference between coating and steel substrate. Lower potential of ZrN than steel promotes oxidation of the nitride to form oxide film as a protective layer. Higher potential of TiN than the substrate will not promote oxidation of the nitride. The substrate oxidizes and its corrosion protective ability will depend on the passive film on the substrate. Thermodynamic calculations were carried out to construct the pH-potential or Pourbaix diagram for ZrN in water which potentially can be used as protective coating. Equilibrium potential for oxide formation from nitride is higher than from its base metal. The shape of immunity, passivity and corrosion regions of nitride follow closely that of the base metal. Theoretial prediction for choosing good protective coatings for particular metal or alloys can be made using this diagram. A local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) technique was developed to enhance understanding of overall impedance of passive systems like stainless steel and aluminum alloys. Local impedance of passive area and pits were measured by this technique. Contribution of these local areas to the overall impedance measured by EIS were identified. Pit may not significantly change the overall impedance because the current from the small pit spread laterally to the larger passive area. The pit response is masked by the response of the passive area. Information on the local corrosion rate of pit and passive area, and pit growth behavior are obtainable from this local impedance technique which is not available from the overall impedance which only provide surface averaged response. Local charge transfer resistance and capacitance values can be used to justify the active pit model for pit in pasive system. Application of LEIS technique to monitor damage in carbon/ glass/vinyl ester composite under simulated galvanic coupling in 0. 5 N NaCl was carried out. Differences of local impedance over blisters and polymer removal regions were measured. Under open circuit condition, significant variation in local impedanec over glass and carbon regions were identified suggesting differences in electrolyte diffusion into the composite at these regions. LEIS technique was found as very useful to measure local corrosion rate and monitor damage. Further investigations on application of this technique to other corrosion system should be conducted to fully utilized its capability to map the impedance of entire corroding surface...|$|R
