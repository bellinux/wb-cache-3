5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> brass necessary. The new brass is marketed {{under the name}} EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E

5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E

5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> these tissues {{is measured in}} weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
50|$|A lead {{usually is}} the contact {{information}} {{and in some}} cases, demographic information of a customer who is interested in a specific product or service. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>leads</b> <b>in</b> the <b>lead</b> generation market: sales leads and marketing leads.|$|R
5000|$|Subchapter IV of the TSCA, [...] "Lead Exposure Reduction", {{enacted by}} the U.S. Congress in 1992 under PL 102-550 {{requires}} the EPA to identify sources <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> contamination <b>in</b> the environment to regulate amounts <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> allowed <b>in</b> products, including paint and toys, and to establish state programs that monitor and reduce lead exposures.|$|R

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall}} of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E

It is noted that absence <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> accumulation <b>in</b> Black Sea nodules results from specific nodule formation and from geochemical activity of the element.

5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, the total amount <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|The largest use <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no {{direct contact with}} humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It {{was not until the}} second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E

In the US, manufacturers may receive tax benefits by reducing the use of lead-based solder. Lead-free solders in commercial use may contain tin, copper, silver, bismuth, indium, zinc, antimony, and traces of other metals. Most lead-free replacements for conventional 60/40 and 63/37Sn-Pb solder have melting points from 5 to 20°C higher, though there are also solders with much lower melting points.|$|E
