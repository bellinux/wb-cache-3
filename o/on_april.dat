5|$|In early April, {{the monsoon}} trough {{established}} itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough {{developed in the}} Caroline Islands <b>on</b> <b>April</b> 9, and resembled {{the characteristics of a}} monsoon depression. Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within the system. The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. <b>On</b> <b>April</b> 11, the system maintained a persistent area of well-organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800UTC <b>on</b> <b>April</b> 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early <b>on</b> <b>April</b> 12 while it was located 105km (65mi) of Pohnpei.
