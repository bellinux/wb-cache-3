50|$|<b>Oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is mainly}} used {{together}} with a N,N-dimethylformamide catalyst in organic synthesis for the preparation of acyl chlorides from the corresponding carboxylic acids. Like thionyl chloride, the reagent degrades into volatile side products in this application, which simplifies workup. One of the minor by-products from this reaction is a potent carcinogen. Relative to thionyl chloride, <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{tends to be a}} milder, more selective reagent. It is also more expensive than thionyl chloride so it tends to be used on a smaller scale.|$|E
50|$|When using <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> as the {{dehydration}} agent, {{the reaction}} {{must be kept}} colder than &minus;60 °C to avoid side reactions. With cyanuric chloride or trifluoroacetic anhydride instead of <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> the reaction can be warmed to &minus;30 °C without side reactions. Other methods for the activation of DMSO to initiate {{the formation of the}} key intermediate 6 are the use of carbodiimides (Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation) and pyridine-sulfur trioxide complex (Parikh-Doering oxidation).

50|$|TCPO can be {{prepared}} from a solution of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in a solution of dry toluene by reaction with <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{in the presence of}} a base such as triethylamine. This method produces crude TCPO with a by-product of triethylamine hydrochloride.The triethylamine hydrochloride can be dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, so the product is more purified. After washing it can be recrystallized from ethyl acetate.|$|E
50|$|Swern {{oxidation}} oxidises secondary alcohols into ketones using <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and dimethylsulfoxide. It {{also requires}} an organic base, such as triethylamine.The by-products are dimethyl sulfide (Me2S), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and - when triethylamine {{is used as}} base - triethylammonium chloride (C6H15NHCl). Dimethyl sulfide and carbon monoxide are very toxic and malodorous compounds, so the reaction and the work-up needs to be performed in a fume hood or outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Recently it {{has been}} found that a high-energy {{intermediate}} in one of these reactions (between <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and hydrogen peroxide in ethyl acetate), which is presumed to be 1,2-dioxetanedione, can accumulate in solution at room temperature (up to a few micromoles at least), provided that the activating dye and all traces of metals and other reducing agents are removed from the system, and the reactions are carried out in an inert atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Owing to its {{simplicity}} and general reliability SOCl2 {{is one of}} the most commonly used reagents for the synthesis of oxazoline rings, however it is often necessary to maintain anhydrous conditions, as oxazolines can be ring-opened by chloride if the imine becomes protonated. The reaction is typically performed at room temperature and is a rare example of a carbonyl oxygen acting as a nucleophile and is similar to the Robinson-Gabriel synthesis. If milder regents are required then SOCl2 may be replaced with <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Paolo Strazzolini {{and others}} {{synthesized}} this compound by reacting <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (COCl)2 or the bromide (COBr)2 with a suspension of silver oxalate (Ag2C2O4) in diethyl ether at −15 °C, followed by evaporation of the solvent at low temperature and pressure. The substance is stable when dissolved in ether and trichloromethane at −30 °C, but decomposes into a 1:1 mixture {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) upon heating to 0 °C. [...] The stability and conformation of the molecule were also analyzed by theoretical methods.|$|E
50|$|Carboxylic {{groups are}} used as the {{precursor}} for most esterification and amidation reactions. The carboxylic group is converted into an acyl chloride {{with the use of}} thionyl or <b>oxalyl</b> <b>chloride</b> which is then reacted with thedesired amide, amine, or alcohol. Carbon nanotubes have been deposited on with silver nanoparticles with the aid of amination reactions. Amide functionalized carbon nanotubes have been shown to chelate silver nanoparticles. Carbon nanotubes modified with acyl chloride react readily with highly branched molecules such as poly(amidoamine), which acts as a template for silver ion and later being reduced by formaldehyde. Amino-modified carbon nanotubes can be prepared by reacting ethylenediamine with an acyl chloride functionalized carbon nanotubes.|$|E
