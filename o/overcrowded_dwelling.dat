40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the role of {{dwelling}} conditions and neighbourhood characteristics in explaining the frequently observed association between housing tenure and health. A postal questionnaire, focusing {{on a number of}} specific aspects of the home and the area, was sent to a random sample of adults in the west of Scotland (achieved sample size 2867, response rate 50 %). The health measures were limiting long-standing illness, self-assessed health, recent symptoms, and anxiety and depression. Having controlled for age, sex, and marital status, housing tenure explained, respectively, 2. 7 %, 5. 4 %, 3. 9 %, 2. 4 % and 5. 4 % of the variance in these variables. These percentages were reduced by between 93 % (for anxiety) and 73 % (for self-assessed health) when housing problems, housing fixtures, <b>overcrowding,</b> <b>dwelling</b> type, access to garden, area type and area amenities were introduced into the model. This suggests that features of the dwelling and its surroundings help to explain observed associations between tenure and health in the UK, and that housing and area problems may be particularly important. Housing improvements and urban regeneration may help to reduce the health gap between housing tenures, and more generally to reduce inequalities in health...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{evaluates the}} new {{statistical}} definition of homelessness {{adopted by the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) {{for the purposes of}} counting the homeless population. The ABS defines a person as homeless if they lack any one of three elements: adequacy of the dwelling; security of tenure in the dwelling; and control of, and access to, space for social relations.  This differs from the former 2 ̆ 7 cultural definition 2 ̆ 7 which identifies people as homeless if they are in specified housing situations. Both definitions suggest there has been growth in homelessness between 2006 and 2011, but the ABS definition has potentially significant implications for policy agendas and practice, because it suggests that homeless people have different demographic characteristics and geographic locations.  For example, the ABS definition suggests significant growth in those living in <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings</b> (termed 2 ̆ 7 housed homelessness 2 ̆ 7 by the author). It is argued that the cultural definition is more comprehensible than the ABS definition and the ABS definition is difficult to operationalise using Census data because many of those in the housed-homeless population cannot be counted. This means that {{it is not possible to}} specify the overall number of homeless people using the ABS definition, nor is it possible to specify the age and gender breakdown. The geographical distribution of the homeless population is also thrown into doubt and this has ramifications for the allocation of resources between the states and territories under the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze what sociodemographic and {{economic}} variables were associated with the presence of untreated caries in 12 -year-old children in the city of S&# 227;o Paulo. This cross-sectional study had a complex sample design. It was based on secondary data generated by the Levantamento epidemiol&# 243;gico em sa&# 250;de bucal (Epidemiological Oral Health Survey) in the city of S&# 227;o Paulo, conducted in 2008, whose sample comprised 4, 246 12 -year-old children from the public and private schools of all the administrative districts of the city. A questionnaire was applied and an epidemiological exam was performed in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations. The variables of interest were categorized into a dependent variable of untreated dental caries (carious component of the DMFT index that corresponds to carious, missing and filled teeth) and independent variables related to the socioeconomic and demographic conditions of the children and their families, and to their access to dental services. The EPI-INFO 06 and STATA 10 programs were used for the analysis; the prevalence ratio and a confidence interval of 95 % were applied to the population parameters. The Poisson regression model was used, adjusted for sampling of the complex type. Caries was associated with ethnicity (higher rate in black people, p = 0. 042), attending public school (p = 0. 000), lower average family income (p = 0. 002), <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings</b> (p = 0. 000) and presence of pain (p = 0. 000).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the children of}} Kingston's poor during the middle decades {{of the nineteenth century}} by bringing together a number of inter-related themes which in many previous studies have been treated separately. Through applying partial reconstitution techniques {{to a wide range of}} source materials, various aspects of children's lives in poverty are analysed and given greater context and meaning. Rather than viewing the child simply as an element in workhouse history, or as a slum-dweller or in employment, this research, by studying individual childhood experiences, focuses on children as members of the wider community. The research findings emphasise the value of a local study, as generalisations and received ideas can be tested against the practical experience of a market town during the mid- to later- nineteenth century, when the country as a whole adjusted to rapid population growth and economic progress. The Kingston-upon-Thames Poor Law Union, the administrative and geographic locality for this research, developed from being broadly rural in the opening years of the study into an increasingly suburban and retailing area, whilst the surrounding villages varied in character, whether purely rural, river-focussed, or concerned with a local industry. Research into the lives of children living in poverty within this diverse locality offers an opportunity to consider and compare strategies, both formal and informal, to deal with child poverty in use throughout the country. The range of choices and decisions open to parents, officials, administrators and children themselves, plus the effect of differing local conditions, geography and employment, remind us that there can be no typical experience which can speak for the whole of England. Within this thesis appear individual experiences of poverty, abandonment, <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings,</b> disease, ill-treatment, and much suffering. Yet also highlighted are acts of benevolence, understanding, chance opportunities, and successful futures. Above all, the thesis has set out to rescue otherwise historically absent individuals from obscurity and give them a meaningful place in the historical record.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores spatial nonconformity as {{a central}} feature of contemporary city-making. Nonconforming urban phenomena in planned modern cities {{of the twentieth century}} have mostly been conceptualized as contradictions to the ideal “plan. ” An examination of the functioning and everyday life of these planned places, however, reveals that rather than being marginal dysfunctional phenomena, spaces that do not conform to formal architectural and planning protocols {{play a central role in}} the way abstract plans are operationalized, and planned cities are experienced. In the planned modernist city of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan designed in 1959 by Greek architect-planner Constantinos A. Doxiadis, a range of actors, including both marginalized and affluent residents and business people along with government functionaries, routinely engage in creating and furthering nonconforming spaces in order to increase access to certain functions, privileges, and necessities. Examples of nonconforming spatial practices in Islamabad include: a) illicit residential constructions that range from <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings</b> built along open drains to sprawling mansions set on expensive lakefront properties, (b) unauthorized uses of authorized buildings, and c) encroachments on greenbelts and sidewalks by poor café owners, street hawkers, formal businesses, foreign diplomatic missions, and government organizations, to name a few. My research asks: What is the relationship between spaces that are planned formally and informally in the case of a comprehensively planned city? What are the similarities and differences found in the spatial practices and political motivations of both state and non-state actors engaged in creating nonconforming spaces? Why are certain nonconforming spaces tolerated for long periods of time while others are strongly resisted by the city’s municipal and development authority? My dissertation thus attempts to trace a contemporary history of Islamabad by focusing on the politics of creating nonconforming spatial exceptions as they emerge in spatial practices and political tactics of government functionaries, privileged and underprivileged residents, and business people of the planned city. My research advances a conceptualization of nonconforming spaces not simply as contradictions to an ideal plan but in terms of rights and entitlements that flow in situations normatively characterized as existing outside the purview of law...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 87 - 99) That "there will be houses, {{comfort and}} security for all" {{was one of}} the rallying cries of the South African progressive movement under apartheid. When, in 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) toppled the, apartheid National Party in the country's first 'free and fair' elections, the promise of 'housing for all' again formed {{an important part of the}} vision of a 'new' South Africa. Yet in Cape Town, thirteen years later, the promises of housing for all conflicts strongly with the reality of an increasing housing backlog in the city. Apart from the obvious growth of informal and <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings</b> around the city, one of the consequences has been that a narrative has emerged among residents born in the city, known as 'borners', that places responsibility for the continuation of their homelessness on people who are born outside of the city. Known as 'migrants', it is against such people that 'borners' have begun to articulate their entitlement to housing in Cape Town. This thesis is an attempt to examine such claims and the divisions which such claims imply. Using a case study of a township called Langa, the thesis attempts to understand how and why such claims are being made. Doing so requires an exploration of South Africa's past and present. By examining the past, the thesis argues, the categories 'homers' and 'migrants' can be seen as products of the attempt by South Africa's past segregationist regimes to mediate between the need for labour by capital and the racist desire to achieve a 'white' South Africa. In the post- 1994 era however, the claims about division are not only encouraged by the discursive legacy of the past, but also by contemporary factors which have encouraged 'borners' to define themselves as different and in opposition to 'migrants'. Factors commonly cited by 'borners' include the facts that housing delivery is slowed by the increased demand for houses that results from large-scale immigration and that housing delivery is biased in favour of 'migrants'. Ultimately however, such conceptions about who is responsible for either producing, or usurping the tiny offerings forthcoming in Langa, misjudge political-economic reasons for the lack of housing. Working-class people waiting for houses pit themselves against others who are also without adequate housing, and the more direct causes of their housing woes, the present housing development strategy and the current direction of the macro-economy, essentially remain unchallenged...|$|R

50|$|The {{town was}} {{originally}} restricted {{to a narrow}} strip of land alongside the river (around the present-day Clive Street) because of the steep bank which hemmed it in. Eventually the town became too overcrowded and in the 18th century buildings began to be erected on the plateau 60 ft above the old, <b>overcrowded,</b> insanitary <b>dwellings</b> alongside the river. The prosperous businessmen and shipowners occupied the New Town whereas the working people remained in {{the lower part of}} town. The low, riverside part of the town was linked to the newer, higher part of the town by a series of stairs. These stairs were initially populated by slum dwellings. Although these dwellings have long since been cleared away, the sets of stairs still exist. One of the first developments of the new town was Dockwray Square, built in 1763: a set of elegant town houses that became populated by wealthy families. However, due to the poor provision of water and drainage facilities, the wealthy families soon moved to the more central part of the new town, especially the new Northumberland Square. Dockwray Square eventually deteriorated into slums. In the early twentieth century Stan Laurel lived at a house in Dockwray Square for a few years, before he became famous. The square has since been re-developed and a statue of Laurel stands in the middle to commemorate his stay there.|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, {{this new}} [...] "National Association" [...] seems the most hopeful and {{practical}} move yet {{made by the}} sanitarists. It may be laughed at somewhat at first, as the British Association was; but the world will find after a while that, like the British Association, it can do great things towards moulding public opinion, and compel men to consider certain subjects, simply by accustoming people to hear them mentioned. The Association will not have existed in vain, if it only removes that dull fear and suspicion with which Englishmen are apt to regard a new subject, simply because it is new. But the Association will do far more than that. It has wisely not confined itself to any one branch of Social Science, but taken the subject in all its complexity. To do {{otherwise would have been}} to cripple itself. It would have shut out many subjects--Law Reform, for instance--which are necessary adjuncts to any Sanitary scheme; while it would have shut out that very large class of benevolent people who have as yet been devoting their energies to prisons, workhouses, and schools. Such will now have an opportunity of learning that they have been treating the symptoms of social disease rather than the disease itself. They will see that vice is rather the effect than the cause of physical misery, and that the surest mode of attacking it is to improve the physical conditions of the lower classes; to abolish foul air, fouled water, foul lodging, and <b>overcrowded</b> <b>dwellings,</b> in which morality is difficult, and common decency impossible. They will not give up--Heaven forbid that they should give up!--their special good works; but they will surely throw the weight of their names, their talents, their earnestness, into the great central object of preserving human life, as soon as they shall have recognised that prevention is better than cure; and that the simple and one method of prevention is, to give the working man his rights. Water, air, light. A right to these three at least he has. In demanding them, he demands no more than God gives freely to the wild beast of the forest. Till society has given him them, it does him an injustice in demanding of him that he should be a useful member of society. If he {{is expected to be a}} man, let him at least be put on a level with the brutes. When the benevolent of the land (and they may be numbered by tens of thousands) shall once have learnt this plain and yet awful truth, a vast upward step will have been gained. Because this new Association will teach it them, during the next ten or twenty years, may God's blessing be on it, and, on the noble old man who presides over it. Often already has he deserved well of his country; but never better than now, when he has lent his great name and great genius to the object of preserving human life from wholesale destruction by unnecessary poison.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the daunting challenge of precarious housing in Salvokop located {{in the southern part}} of inner City of Tshwane, Gauteng Province. Insecure tenure, unmaintained <b>dwellings,</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> mushrooming of backyard shacks and the rise of the informal settlement, all that led to deep levels of vulnerability and neighbourhood deterioration. Current conditions show that life in that neighbourhood is fraught as substandard housing degenerated into slum and squalor. This concern emerged among other salient pressing issues of poverty and vulnerability from the World Café and Focus Groups with the inner city churches including those from Salvokop. The article set out to describe precarious housing, unpleasant living conditions owing to the fact that human beings stay in unsuitable dwellings while the environment deteriorates. Taking into account their circumstances, the article’s aim was to recapture the extent to which the residents suffer as a result of living in dwellings unfit for human habitation, rethinking an alternative model to respond. A theological agenda for future ecclesiological engagement was discerned forthwith recommendations. The article makes a contribution towards the theology of the city in that it stimulates church practices and housing of poor people in Tshwane. It does so by engaging in a unique way grassroots knowledge from the different inner city congregations. This process used the platform of surveys, World Café style gatherings and Focus Groups. In conversation with the primary source, this article also contributed with original data generated with the Salvokop residents whose stories helped to expend on horizons of housing, which is acknowledged.

40|$|Abstract: Houseflies, Musca domestica Linnaeus, are commonest insects of both {{farms and}} homes. This species have {{increasingly}} <b>overcrowded</b> human <b>dwellings,</b> particularly {{in rural areas}} and constitute a health hazard. These flies are not only a nuisance, {{but they can also}} transport disease-causing organisms. This may lead to the spread of diseases and also mycotoxin-producing fungi. As a result, frequent exposure to the activity of houseflies {{will have an impact on}} public health. Houseflies are dominant in exposed items such as drinking water, food and human faeces. The study was conducted to determine the potential of houseflies in enhancing fungal contamination of food commodities. A total of 183 samples of houseflies (122), maize (15), porridge (19) and water (27) samples collected from Gauteng Province of South Africa were screened for fungi contamination by serial dilution technique on agar plates following DNA sequencing. In this case, 729 fungal isolates were identified with the most commonly isolated fungi belonging to the genera of Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. On the other hand, Aspergillus flavus was by far the most common, followed by A. niger, A. parasiticus and A. fumigatus. The most common Fusarium species were F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum and F. culmorum. Among the Penicillium species, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. brevicompactum, P. oslonii and P. verrucosum were the most common fungi. The incidence rates of fungal contamination per total fungal count isolated in houseflies, porridge, maize and water were recorded with fungal load of 2 x 108 CFU/ml, 2 x 107 CFU/g, 1 x 107 CFU/g and 1 x 102 CFU/g. Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium species recovered were further confirmed and quantified for the production of aflatoxins (AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1 and AFG 2), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis of houseflies isolates by TLC revealed that FB 1 was found with the highest incidence rate of 62 (73 %) while, ZEA and DON had the lowest incidence rate of 15 (18 %) and 8 (9 %). For Fusarium isolates (66) from maize, only 11 (17 %) of the extracts were positive for FB 1 from F. verticillioides. The fluorescence of AFs and OTA viewed under ultra violet light revealed that some isolates were positive showing a light blue fluorescence for AFB 1 and AFB 2, light green fluorescence for AFG 1 and AFG 2, while a blue-green fluorescence was observed for OTA. According to the results on HPLC, Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus were found to be the main producers of AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1 and AFG 2, while A. carbonarius, A. niger and A. D. Tech.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} discern the impact of social housing on public health in the cities of Glasgow, Scotland and Baltimore, Maryland in the twentieth century. Additionally, this dissertation seeks to compare the impact of social housing policy implementation in both cities, to determine the efficacy of social housing {{as a tool of}} public health betterment. This is accomplished through the exposition and evaluation of the housing and health trends of both cities {{over the course of the}} latter half of the twentieth century. Both the cities of Glasgow and Baltimore had long struggled with both overcrowded slum districts and relatively unhealthy populations. Early commentators had noticed the connection between insanitary housing and poor health, and sought a solution to both of these problems. Beginning in the 1940 s, housing reform advocates (self-dubbed ‘housers') pressed for the development of social housing, or municipally-controlled housing for low-income persons, to alleviate the problems of <b>overcrowded</b> slum <b>dwellings</b> in both cities. The impetus for social housing was twofold: to provide affordable housing to low-income persons and to provide housing that would facilitate healthy lives for tenants. Whether social housing achieved these goals is the crux of this dissertation. In the immediate years following the Second World War, social housing was built en masse in both cities. Social housing provided a reprieve from slum housing for both working-class Glaswegians and Baltimoreans. In Baltimore specifically, social housing provided accommodation for the city’s Black residents, who found it difficult to occupy housing in White neighbourhoods. As the years progressed, social housing developments in both cities faced unexpected problems. In Glasgow, stable tenant flight (including both middle class and skilled artisan workers) + resulted in a concentration of poverty in the city’s housing schemes, and in Baltimore, a flight of White tenants of all income levels created a new kind of state subsidized segregated housing stock. The implementation of high-rise tower blocks in both cities, once heralded as a symbol of housing modernity, also faced increased scrutiny in the 1960 s and 1970 s. During the period of 1940 - 1980, before policy makers in the United States began to eschew social housing for subsidized private housing vouchers and community based housing associations had truly taken off in Britain, public health professionals conducted academic studies of the impact of social housing tenancy on health. Their findings provide the evidence used to assess the second objective of social housing provision, as outlined above. Put simply, while social housing units were undoubtedly better equipped than slum dwellings in both cities, the public health investigations into the impact of rehousing slum dwellers into social housing revealed that social housing was not a panacea for each city’s social and public health problems...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{discovery}} and exploitation {{of oil in}} the international markets during the late 1960 s, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was considered {{as one of the most}} deprived regions of the world. However, since then the country has enjoyed remarkable rise in national economic prosperity and sharp increase in personal and household income. Surplus oil economy and adoption of generous welfare programmes by both UAE federal and Dubai local authorities have entirely transformed the social, economic and physical landscape of the country. One such area that has been highly influenced by the new wave of transformation and modernization is housing. Housing conditions in the pre-oil era were grim as more than 80 % of the inhabitants were housed in <b>overcrowded</b> makeshift <b>dwellings</b> made of palm leaves referred to locally as barasti. By the end of 1960 s, housing conditions were undergoing major improvements as the government began to use oil money in subsidizing both income and housing in the form of free serviced residential plots for all middle-incomen ational householdsa nd guaranteedh igh-paying public sectorj obs. With better income and increasing subsidies, housing consumption among newly emerging middle-income households during this period had improved dramatically as overcrowding dropped from 3. 2 to only 1. 6 persons per room and the per capita share of domestic space rose from 15 to 32 square metres per inhabitant. Following the examples of other oil-rich Arab Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in 1993, the Dubai government introduced a new housing policy scheme aimed at providing middle-income households with interest-free housing loans in order to facilitate their access to what the government calls adequate owner-occupant housing. The value of each loan was set at AED 500, 000 ($ 136, 240) with a repayment period of 25 years. Although the value of the loan was set to enable middle-class households to build and consume adequate housing, adequate housing itself has never been clearly defined. From the time since the interestfree loan programme was introduced, typical middle-class dwellings have more than doubled in size and average housing consumption rate has climbed to 71. 5 square meters per person exceeding all national, regional and international rates. Moreover, the average number of person per room has declined sharply to only 0. 6. This research aims to study the various causes behind the major increase in the size of the contemporarym iddle-classd wellings and the subsequenrt ise in the rates of housing consumption among this study population. It aims to examine the implications of the current interest-free loan policy and the consequences of the prevailing high levels of housing consumption for loan beneficiaries and other applicants. The interest-free housing loan policy has several shortcomings. It has triggered high demand in relationship to supply. Because of shortage in budget, high value of individual loans and very long repayment period, a major backlog of eligible applications has emerged and waiting time has been increasing steadily. Moreover, the policy has also enabled the few to over-consume scarce housing resources, while providing no assistance for the majority. The interest-free loan policy does not match the specific needs and preferences of the target population. It assumes that all middle-class households have similar housing needs and does not recognize in any way difference in income, household size and aspirations within the various target population subgroups. Additionally, the strict ban on the sale of the dwelling units imposed by the government has trapped many households in large and mostly under-utilized dwellings.

40|$|Background: Arterial {{hypertension}} (AH) manifested {{during childhood}} and teenage years has ‎been considered, {{for a long}} period of time, as being a rare disease and almost exclusively a ‎secondary one. Within the last 10 - 15 years, as the diagnosis techniques improved and the ‎research regarding juvenile AH extended, the diagnosis criteria have been reconsidered and as a ‎consequence, the disease has become more frequent until reaching the age of 16, compared to the ‎past periods of time. ‎Aim & Objectives: The research was carried out during the year 2011, within the partnership ‎educational project, Integration through Schools and Anthropology, No. 357 / 2011. The general ‎objective stated for the anthropological study implied by this project is to examine inter- and ‎trans-disciplinary certain aspects of the lifestyle of the children and teenagers belonging to rural ‎Roma people communities and its impact on their health, likelihood to develop certain diseases as ‎well as to propose prophylactic measures. Within the general objective framework, for the ‎purpose of this paper I isolated the findings related to the incidence of AH among children and ‎teenagers and I explored its possible relation to the community lifestyle (eating habits, improper ‎housing, family size) and genetic factors (AH family history, precocious appearance of secondary ‎sexual features as a sign of early adulthood). ‎Methods/Study Design: The medical and anthropometrical research was carried out on two ‎groups of students from the rural environment, aged between 10 and 16 years: one control group ‎and an experimental group. The control group was formed of 100 Romanian students, 30 % boys ‎and 70 % girls. The experimental group, formed of 100 Romanian students from a Roma people ‎rural community, 26 % boys, 74 % girls. The Roma people rural communities preserve a more ‎archaic lifestyle, including culinary habits, that can influence the incidence of AH. ‎Questionnaires comprising 63 questions were administered for the completion of data regarding ‎their lifestyle. For the statistical comparisons we calculated the Odds Ratio (OR) using CHI ‎Square test with Yates’ correction. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the ‎characterization of the anthropometric variables. The subjects involved in the research were not ‎diagnosed with kidney, cardiovascular or endocrine diseases or with mental retardation. ‎Study Design: Prospective case-control. ‎Consent: The volunteers were selected after their parents had freely expressed their informed ‎consent in written form. ‎Results/ Findings: The incidence of AH among the participating children and teenagers in both ‎groups is within the limits mentioned in the field literature, 4. 00 % for the control group and ‎‎ 7. 00 % for the experimental group. There is a positive association (OR= 1. 8064), statistically ‎significant (p 0. 05) between the two groups regarding the anthropometric variables ‎analyzed pertaining to gender. ‎Conclusion: According to the field scientific literature it is generally accepted that systolic ‎and/or diastolic AH is 3 - 4 times more frequent among obese children and teenagers comparing to ‎those with normal weight and 6 - 8 times to underweight ones (1 Gherasim 1996). Nevertheless, ‎the findings of the research presented in this paper indicate that certain particularities of the ‎lifestyle (increased salt consumption, <b>overcrowded</b> and improper <b>dwellings)</b> and certain genetic ‎factors (AH family history, early adulthood) may explain a higher incidence of AH even among ‎normal-weight and underweight children and teenagers. ...|$|R
