40|$|Context: Preseptal {{cellulitis}} is the commonest orbital disease which frequently {{needs to}} be differentiated from <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics can prevent vision loss and life-threatening complications of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> Aims: To describe the clinical profile of cases with preseptal and <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> admitted to a tertiary care hospital {{during a period of}} nine years. The causative organisms and the clinical outcome were analyzed. Settings and Design : Retrospective descriptive case study done in a tertiary care hospital in South India. Material and Methods: The in-patient records of patients with preseptal and <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> were reviewed from 1998 to 2006. The factors reviewed included ocular findings aiding in the distinction of the two clinical conditions, the duration of symptoms, the duration of hospital stay, microbiological culture report of pus or wound swab, blood culture, drugs used for treatment, the response to therapy and complications. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive analysis. Results: One hundred and ten cases, 77 patients with preseptal cellulitis and 33 patients with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> were reviewed. Five percent of children and 21 % of adults presented with cutaneous anthrax contributing to preseptal cellulitis. Thirty-nine percent cases with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> were caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Conclusions: This study has helped in identifying organisms which cause orbital infections, especially community-acquired MRSA.

40|$|BackgroundPreseptal and <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> {{range in}} {{severity}} from minor to potentially severe complications. The {{purpose of this}} study is to describe the clinical features of patients with preseptal or <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> in one medical center in Taiwan, and to assess the effectiveness of treatments and the complications. MethodsPatients admitted between 1996 and 2005 to Taipei Veterans General Hospital under the diagnosis of preseptal or <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> were retrospectively reviewed. The demographics, administrative history, past history, clinical presentations, treatments, and complications were analyzed. ResultsIn total, 94 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for preseptal or <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> were identified (67 had pre-septal <b>cellulitis,</b> 27 had <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis).</b> While paranasal sinus disease was the most common predisposing cause in orbital cases, skin lesions in children and dacryocystitis in adults were the most common in preseptal cases. Microbiologic investigations showed variable results, but the most common pathogen isolated was Staphylococcus aureus. Cultures from eye swabs and local abscesses gave the highest positive yield. Blood cultures were taken in some patients, but the positive rate was extremely low. Treatments included intravenous antibiotics alone, or intravenous antibiotics combined with surgical drainage.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the CT findings of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> due to sinusitis. METHODS: The records and CT scans of 45 consecutive patients with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> due to sinusitis treated at the Hospital of the Medical School of Ribeirão Preto {{were analyzed by}} a radiologist and two orbital surgeons. RESULTS: Three major types of CT changes were observed: diffuse fat infiltration, subperiosteal abscess and orbital abscess. Diffuse fat infiltration (characterized by an increased density of the extra- or intraconal fat) was seen in 11 patients (24. 44 %). A subperiosteal abscess was diagnosed in 28 patients (62. 23 %). A surgically proved orbital abscess was detected in 6 patients (13. 33 %). CONCLUSIONS: In all cases of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> due to sinusitis intraorbital changes can be detected by CT scans either as a diffuse infiltration of the orbital fat or as a detachment of the periorbita (subperiosteal abscess) or a true orbital abscess. Category I of Chandler <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> classification (inflammatory edema) must {{be understood as a}} stage of a process that is already happening within the orbit and, as the term "preseptal cellulitis" means a palpebral infection, this designation should not be used to stage <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis...</b>|$|R

"nOrbital imaging should be obtained in all patients suspected of having <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> CT is preferred to MR imaging, as the orbital tissues have high con-trast and the bone can be well visualized. Orbital CT scanning allows localization of the disease process to the preseptal area, the extraconal or intraconal fat, or the subperiosteal space. Axial CT views allow evaluation of the medial orbit and ethmoid sinuses, whereas coronal scans image the orbital roof and floor and the frontal and maxillary sinuses. If direct coronal imaging is not possible, reconstruction of thin axial cuts may help the assessment of the orbital roof and floor. Potential sources of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> such as sinusitis, dental infection, and facial cellulitis are often detectable on CT imaging.

40|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} condition previously associated with severe complications. If untreated, <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> can be potentially sight and life threatening.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Cellulitis</b> in the <b>orbital</b> {{region is}} a {{relatively}} frequently observed ocular disease. Differential diagnosis of preseptal and <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> is clinically possible. However physical examination may be insufficient for some differential diagnoses. The majority of pediatric patients with <b>orbital</b> and preseptal <b>cellulitis</b> present with complications of sinusitis. If left untreated it may cause vision loss and life-threatening intracranial complications. In this study we investigated the clinical findings, efficacy of treatment and complications of patients with <b>orbital</b> and preseptal <b>cellulitis.</b> Material and Methods: The files of all 28 in-patients with <b>orbital</b> and preseptal <b>cellulitis</b> who applied to our third stage pediatric clinic {{in the two years}} between January 2011 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. The demographic data, clinical presentation, predisposing factors, treatments and complications were analyzed. Results: Seven <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> and 21 preseptal cellulitis patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria were included in the study. Twenty-five patients were treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam and/or seftriakson. The most important predisposing factor in both patient groups was sinusitis while other predisposing factors were tooth abscess, conjunctivitis, chicken pox and leukemia. In five of every seven patients (71. 4 %) with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis,</b> sinusitis is diagnosed. These five patients have ethmoidal sinusitis. Of every 21 patients with preseptal cellulitis, five (23. 8 %) have sinusitis. Of these five patients three have ethmoidal sinusitis. In the preseptal cellulitis group the median hospital stay was five days (3 - 21) while in the <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> group the median stay was 21 days (8 - 35). In the preseptal cellulitis group while the median CRP was 15 mg/dL (1 - 141), median leukocyte count was 10600 u/L (800 - 23400) and median neutrophil count was 10100 u/L (200 - 21400), in the <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> group the median CRP was 20 mg/dL (1 - 91), median leukocyte count was 14042 +/- 5498 u/L and median neutrophil count was 10571 +/- 2818 u/L. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (p> 0. 05). The positivity in both swab cultures and blood cultures was at a very low level. All patients were discharged with full recovery. No patient required primary orbital surgical intervention. Conclusion: Preseptal cellulitis is more frequently observed than <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> The most important predisposing factor for <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> is sinusitis. Patients with preseptal cellulitis suspected clinically may be diagnosed with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> radiologically. As a result radiological imaging of preseptal cellulitis patients should be considered. [Cukurova Med J 2015; 40 (2. 000) : 267 - 274...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{incidence}} of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> after <b>orbital</b> blowout fracture. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> {{and a history of}} recent orbital fracture. METHODS: A medical record review of clinical history, imaging studies, and surgical and treatment outcome was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resolution of <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> and surgical and imaging findings. RESULTS: Four patients (3 male; mean age, 30 years [range, 4. 5 - 58]) were treated for <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> complicating <b>orbital</b> fracture. All patients had evidence of paranasal sinusitis before or after the orbital injury, and 2 also reported forceful nose blowing after sustaining orbital trauma. Although 3 patients received prophylactic oral antibiotics after the fracture, this failed to prevent infection. Sinusitis commenced 1 to 2 weeks before and as late as 5 weeks after orbital injury. All patients were treated with IV antibiotics. Two developed an orbital abscess that required surgical drainage; 1 patient improved after an endonasal maxillary antrostomy. One patient improved on IV antibiotics alone and underwent fracture repair at a later stage. These 4 patients represent 0. 8 % of all cases of orbital fractures treated in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> is a rare complication of orbital fracture, and seems to be more common when paranasal sinus infection preexists or occurs within several weeks of the injury. Oral antibiotics given after the orbital injury may not prevent <b>orbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> or abscess formation. Surgery may be required to drain orbital abscess or in nonresolving cellulitis to drain the paranasal sinuses.
