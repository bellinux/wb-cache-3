50|$|During the Phoney War, {{isolated}} skirmishes {{occurred between}} the M.S.406 and fighters of the Luftwaffe, particularly early {{models of the}} Messerschmitt Bf 109. For 32 claimed 'kills' and 16 'probables' achieved by M.S.406s, including against the Bf 109, 13 were lost in combat along with 33 more that were lost within the border zone under vague circumstances. According to Botquin, by this stage, the weaknesses of the M.S.406 were already apparent, such as the lack of armouring, frequent gun-jamming, inadequate firepower, slow responsiveness of the guns, unreliable radio units, very high rate of engine wear, corrosion of rudder components, cabin glazing breaking under air pressure during certain manoeuvres, loss of exterior panels due to screws deteriorating rapidly, and the lack <b>of</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{the safety of the}} moving car,we have to make {{simulation}} and analysis of the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> We should consider, in addition to the geometric dimensions, standards and demands, a reasonable choice of the mirror size and installing position, the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in the design <b>of</b> the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this paper, we use the finite element software ANSYS to simulate the vibration frequency and vibration modals <b>of</b> the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> under the condition of excitation sources. Based on this and the strength analysis results <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> we make a optimal design <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> structure. We get five-order vibration modals in working condition and analysis the size of displacement and deformation, and dynamic characteristics. The results show that because of the low modal frequency, the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is easily inspired by the engine, powertrain system and road to vibrate. Besides, the deformation and the strain distribution <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> are not uniform. So we should control the low rank flexibility modal frequency within a certain threshold frequency when designing its structure. On the condition of little changes of its overall volume, the maximum equivalent stress <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> decreased by 30. 5 % through optimizing design...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce an {{aerodynamic}} tonal noise from a <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> active control technique with oscillating jets was utilized. Since the aerodynamic tonal noise <b>of</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> was generated by a small perturbation caused by a small step on a surface <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> oscillating jets were introduced to break it. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to measure aerodynamic sound and flow fields around the two dimensional backward-facing step. The experimental {{results showed that the}} noise reduction level depended on the frequency and intensity of the oscillating jets. The noise reduction level was over 20 dB at the oscillation frequency about 400 Hz and the amplitude of the jet about 0. 1 m/s. Both of the frequency and intensity of the jet were smaller than the frequency of the feedback noise (2 kHz) and the velocity of the uniform flow (30 m/s). These results indicated that the oscillating jets effectively reduced aerodynamic noise with small amount of energy...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is a metaphoric {{favourite}} {{in popular}} culture. This exploratory essay positions the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> as, predominantly, a quintessentially modern device for reimagining {{the past and}} its relationship to the present and future. Combined with that icon of modern economies, the motorcar, it gives a sense of a paved journey towards the future while from the driver’s seat allowing a framed, receding view of the past. With distance that past can be critically held: ‘it now makes sense’. This sensemaking relies upon a spatial rendering of time that makes past, present and future concrete. However, this dominant metaphor <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in popular culture is supplemented by less certain uses: it can also evoke the uncanny; bring spectres from the past into the present; or heighten our enmeshment with structural power. This essay explores this terrain <b>of</b> the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in examples from radio, song, music video and film, and then questions the efficacy of the metaphor in the anthropocene. The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> then, is an entry point for considering our engagement with the past, present and future, and how and where is our gaze directed and for whom...|$|R

40|$|We report two {{experiments}} that investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> distance and curvature on distance, spacing, and time-to-contact (TTC) judgements. The variation in mirror distance {{had a significant}} effect on TTC judgements, but only marginally influenced distance and spacing estimations. As mirror distance increased, TTC was overestimated, which is potentially dangerous. Control conditions with identical visual angles across different mirror distances revealed that effects were not solely caused by variation in visual angle. The impact of mirror curvature moderated the effect. While observers were unable to compensate for the mirror distance effect, they could do so for the distortions generated by non-planar mirrors, at least up to a certain degree of distortion. Implications for vehicle design and national guidelines are discussed. Practitioner Summary: Regulations regarding <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are vastly different between countries. For instance EU regulations encourage convex driver-side mirrors, whereas US regulations allow them merely on the passenger's side. The use of a dynamic TTC paradigm puts the human factors designer in a position to evaluate the existing regulations and to design safer mirrors...|$|R

50|$|Though {{the vehicle}} never {{underwent}} a generational facelift {{on the scale}} of the GAZ-21 (if one does not count its derivative successors), nonetheless the car was modernised during production. The early stage included removal <b>of</b> bonnet-mounted <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors,</b> new ignition and boot locks. The novel belt-speedometer proved too complicated and was replaced by a standard arrow-driven one, as was the fate of the engine cooling coupling that controlled the ventilator fan (proved unreliable, the ventilator would be permanently on, whilst warm air for cold starts would be manually controlled with venetian-type shutter). Additions included external comfort lights were on the rear pillar's chrome element, that turned on upon opening of rear doors.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{real-time}} rendering of polygon mesh surfaces with reflection or refraction. The basic process {{is similar to}} dynamic environment mapping or cube mapping.

Existing real-time techniques suffer from the differences between the viewpoint for the environment map and each reflection point. The proposed method minimizes this by finding an optimal viewpoint for the reflective or refractive mesh. With a sufficient number of vertices and map image resolutions, the users can render reflected images as accurate as ray tracing for all practical purposes, except for reflected objects around ray converging points of reflection on concave surfaces or refraction through convex lenses. The method can be applied to areas which require accuracy such as industrial design. Experiments with a CAD model <b>of</b> a car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> and spectacle lenses exhibited results of sufficient quality for design verification. 1...|$|R
