40|$|The most {{important}} feature of a Self-Reconfigurable Robot (SRR) {{is that it is}} reconfigurable and self-repairing. At the centre of these capabilities is autonomous docking. One difficulty for docking is the alignment between two robots. Current strategies overcome this by integrating a mechanical guiding device within the <b>connecting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This increases the robustness of docking but compromises the flexibility of reconfiguration. In this paper, we present a new autonomous docking strategy that can overcome the drawbacks of current approaches. The new strategy uses a novel hook-type <b>connecting</b> <b>mechanism</b> and multi-sensory guidance. The hook-type <b>connecting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is strong and rigid for reliable physical connection between the modules. The multi-sensory docking strategy, which includes visual-sensor-guided rough positioning, Hall-sensor-guided fine positioning, and the locking between moving and target modules, guarantees robust docking without sacrificing reconfigurability. The proposed strategy is verified by docking between a worm-shaped robot and one target module, and docking among three moving robots to form a T-shaped configuration. The experimental results showed that the strategy is very effective...|$|R

For realizing the precise positioning, the various piezo-driven stages have been already proposed and micro/nano scale resolution has been achieved. However, it is {{pointed out that the}} existing precision positioning tools are too large compared to operating area. Their devices are too difficult to combine other devices and use in tight environment under microscope. In this paper, a wire <b>connected</b> <b>mechanism</b> for precise positioning under microscope is proposed. The proposed positioning system is simply composed actuators including piezoelectric element and super extra-fine wires. By applying wire <b>connected</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the saving of larger work space compared to traditional devices is expected. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rake-car’s {{driving system}} of ore {{reclaimer}} originally used crank and <b>connecting</b> rod <b>mechanism</b> as driving mechanism. The driving mechanism got some trouble that parts got severe wear and failure rate of mechanism was high. The hydraulic system {{is used to}} drive rake car in view of hydraulic driving system’s advantage. By analysis on existing problem of crank and <b>connecting</b> rod <b>mechanism,</b> the actual working load of equipment is tested and the working situation is analysed. The working situation of the hydraulic system is also analysed by computer simulation. By optimization of the hydraulic system design, the final design is determined. The whole system is actually used. It works well. Overview The ore reclaimer is key equipment in mineral material factory. It is used to convey ore to belt. One mine material factory of some large steel enterprise has four ore reclaimer. The rake car of the ore reclaimer is driven by crank and <b>connecting</b> rod <b>mechanism.</b> It is composed of motor, gearbox, crank and <b>connecting</b> rod <b>mechanism</b> and rake car. During running, there were some faults that mechanical wear, gear of reduction box getting broken, movement of mechanism having serious impact and so on.

40|$|Free-flying space robotic devices, {{in which}} {{manipulators}} are {{mounted on a}} thruster-equipped spacecraft, will assist in the construction, repair and maintenance of satellites and future space stations. Operation in a free-floating mode, in which spacecraft thrusters are turned off, increases a system's life. The teleoperation of free-floating systems is complicated due to the dynamic coupling between a system's manipulator and its spacecraft. Controlling such a system using visual feedback is not straightforward, especially when the task is to move the end-effector with respect to an inertially fixed target. In addition, free-floating systems are subject to path-dependent Dynamic Singularities, which restrict the paths by which Path Dependent Workspace points can be reached. These characteristics can result in increased operator burden during system teleoperation. A teleoperation planning system to assist the operator of a free-floating space robot is presented. Given an initial and a target end-effector location, and an <b>optional</b> <b>connecting</b> path, this system examines the feasibility of reaching the target from the initial location. If a problem is detected, the system proposes an alternative feasible path. An example demonstrates the value of such a teleoperator planning aid...|$|R
