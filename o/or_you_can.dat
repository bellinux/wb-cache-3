25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

Due to their opposition to the project, in July 2013, Governor Jay Inslee labeled both Rivers and Senator Don Benton from the neighboring 17th district [...] "a brick wall to economic progress and CRC." [...] Speaking to a group of CRC supports, [...] "The road to this bridge runs through two senators from this region.

It opens with shots of her showered in gold as she rises out of a glittering bowl formed of dust while dramatic music plays in the background; several of the scenes are filmed using a slow motion technique. Her voiceover is heard in the background, [...] "You can let yourself disappear, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stir things up. Never settle, shake loose. Embrace the elements.

500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E

Well, here we are." [...] The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city. Daniel White, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{revealed}} which characters {{will appear}} on the opposing factions. They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} {{or cutting}} of some characters sparked speculation from fans {{as to the}} importance of the characters in the final book of the series, which was released just ten days after the film. In April 2006, representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' brother and the barman of the Hog's Head, in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore's Army. A week later WB announced that the role was [...] "very minor", allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role, which, before the final book, was not even a speaking part. MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf, who appeared in the second film, Chamber of Secrets, and in the fifth book, would be cut, opening up [...] "plot questions" [...] as to how the role of the elf would be filled. MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher, the Black family's house-elf, was cut from the film in one draft of the script. However, after Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him, saying, [...] "You know, I wouldn't [...] if I were you. <b>Or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> but if you get to make a seventh film, you'll be tied in knots", he was added back into the script.|$|E

2500|$|Former {{graduate}} student Richard Terrile remembers that Westphal [...] "not only taught me about astronomy and science, {{but also about}} more down-to-earth topics like self-reliance, dealing with people, and how to keep focused when things go bad.

He said, 'There are always two {{ways to deal with}} a problem: You can get angry and upset and then try and fix it, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just fix it.

2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on that sentiment, {{and said}} [...] "It’s a very cynically romantic text about love, {{and how we}} behave, and how we’re expected to behave. It’s a party, but there’s something darker there as well". Inspired by the exposing nature of film, Whedon decided to infuse a recurring motif of sexuality, [...] "...because it’s a visual medium. You can say it <b>or</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> show it. [...] There’s an element to it, of debauchery, that was fun for a time {{but then it was}} just sort of dark". Whedon's idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having [...] "Shakespeare readings" [...] at his house with several of his friends, years prior.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. <b>Or,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have a separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
