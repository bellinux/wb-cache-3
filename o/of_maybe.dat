25|$|The Poets' {{second album}} Carnival of Rust was {{released}} in Finland on 12 April 2006 and has since been released in Sweden, Australia, Ukraine, Russia, Germany and on iTunes.

25|$|The {{remaining}} eight crewmen {{clung to}} the wreckage throughout the night but by dawn the next morning, Captain Bell and seaman Bill Cunningham had succumbed to hypothermia and died, still afloat nearby in their life-jackets. Through the sea mist Norris spotted a beach several miles off. It was decided that each man should try {{to make his own}} way to shore, and so at intervals <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> 15 minutes one-by-one the men left the floating planks and struck-out for the beach. Nagle, who didn't have a life-jacket, went first, followed by Thomsen and Fitzsimmons. After about an hour Fizsimmons passed the earlier two, still alive but near exhaustion, and at around 10am he stumbled onto Woonona beach where he flagged down a Hubbards Bakery truck driven by a Mr Hobbs, who took him to Bulli Police Station where he broke the news of the shipwreck.|$|E

25|$|Altogether, the Eurasian teal is {{much less}} common than its American counterpart, though still very plentiful. Its numbers are mainly {{assessed}} by counts of wintering birds; some 750,000 are recorded annually around the Mediterranean and Black Seas, 250,000 in temperate western Europe, and more than 110,000 in Japan. In 1990 and 1991, a more detailed census was undertaken, yielding over 210,000 birds wintering in Iran, some 109,000 in Pakistan, about 77,000 in Azerbaijan, some 37,000 in India, 28,000 in Israel, over 14,000 in Turkmenistan and almost 12,000 in Taiwan. It appears to be holding its own currently, with its slow decline <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> 1–2% annually in the 1990s – presumably mainly due to drainage and pollution of wetlands – not warranting action other than continuing to monitor the population and possibly providing better protection for habitat on the wintering grounds. The IUCN and BirdLife International classify the Eurasian teal as a species of Least Concern, unchanged from their assessment before the split of the more numerous A. carolinensis.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{and musical}} content <b>of</b> <b>Maybe</b> You've Been Brainwashed Too was {{compared}} {{to a variety of}} artists. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music likened the New Radicals' politically oriented lyrics to British rock band Chumbawamba. In Entertainment Weeklys review of the album, critic Tom Sinclair compared the album's music to that of Hanson. The Los Angeles Times compared the New Radicals to the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Alexander's vocal performance drew frequent comparisons to Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, while a review by AllMusic suggested his vocals were similar to Mick Jagger's. In Consequence of Sound, critic Justin Gerber commented that the album [...] "made Gregg Alexander the 90's answer to Phil Spector, without the bad rap of murdering people." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna has {{received}} acclaim {{as a role}} model for businesswomen in her industry, [...] "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2billion in sales within the first decade of her career. Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as [...] "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." [...] London Business School academics called her a [...] "dynamic entrepreneur" [...] worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that [...] "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her." [...] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted: [...] "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies." [...] According to Forbes, Madonna is the wealthiest woman in the music business.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mattes {{said that}} when Ubisoft was {{initially}} developing the game, cooperative gameplay with an AI-controlled partner was the main idea they wanted to build on. Mattes explained, [...] "We knew from day one basically cooperative gameplay was the hook {{that was going to}} replace Sands of Time... We didn't always know {{that it was going to}} be Elika from day one... We sort of explored the idea <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> a child or father figure or brother, or something like that." [...] The idea to base the game around AI-controlled functions came from [...] Mattes explained that the team felt the relationship between Farah and the Prince character worked well from a story-telling point-of-view in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, so they decided to expand on the concept.|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Mass Effect: Andromeda {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from video game publications. The game {{was not as}} well received as its predecessors; in his review for Forbes, Paul Tassi wrote, [...] "I {{have a feeling that}} Mass Effect fans will enjoy the game, but I don’t think anyone will claim it outclasses the original trilogy, outside <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> the very first game." [...] Many outlets described the game as a disappointment, with Eurogamer noting that it [...] "launched to mixed reviews and polarised fans". Some critics also described the game as a missed opportunity, such as Joe Juba of Game Informer, who concluded, 'Mass Effect: Andromeda is fun, and the important parts work ... At the same time, I was often left looking through a haze of inconveniences and dreaming about the game it could have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{and around}} Detroit Lakes are several lakes used for fishing, boating, wake sports, sailing, jet-skiing, swimming, and {{freshwater}} scuba diving. Most prominent and heavily used is Detroit Lake, which features the mile-long city beach. The beach annually hosts the city's Independence Day celebration and fireworks display. [...] In and around Detroit Lakes are 14 golf courses. The area also features an amusement park, a paintball arena, two river tubing companies, and a horseback riding ranch. The city also hosts the annual Becker County Fair. The Shrine Circus performs in Detroit Lakes each {{year at the}} Kent Freeman Arena. In the winter off-season, the area remains a popular recreation destination for ice fishing, snowmobiling, cross country skiing and downhill skiing and snowboarding at the newly renovated Detroit Mountain Recreation Area.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{following}} {{the story of}} a central character, Redford Stevens, on the album was the idea of band manager Richard Nichols. According to Questlove, the album's protagonist Redford is [...] "the prototypical urban kid — young, gifted, black, and unraveling before our eyes," [...] and is based on [...] "a combination <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> four to five people that we know in Philadelphia." [...] Regarding the character, Black Thought said, [...] "Redford's story isn't uncommon in Philadelphia ... I remember not being able to imagine being alive as a 30-year-old. I didn't know many people who had lived to 30." [...] Inspiration for Redford was also culled from the Sufjan Stevens song [...] "Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)" [...] from his album Michigan and the character Avon Barksdale from TV series The Wire. Some sources have interpreted Redford as an African-American everyman, though others have cautioned against this view, emphasizing his individual characteristics. For instance, Hilary Brown of Down Beat called Redford [...] "a romantic, not a thug; a philosopher, not an everyman," [...] and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah wrote [...] "The mistake is to read Redford as being like anyone who has their back to the wall, or to see the album’s narrative as a universal story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The season {{picks up}} [...] "a few months" [...] after Jessica Jones, and {{is set in}} Harlem rather than the Hell's Kitchen of the {{previous}} Marvel Netflix series, which Colter described as [...] "a completely different world". Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief Joe Quesada said that unlike the fictionalized version of Hell's Kitchen depicted in Daredevil and Jessica Jones, which was more inline with how {{it was when the}} comics were first written, the Harlem of Luke Cage represents the Harlem of [...] "today", and is truer to the real-life modern New York. However, Colter admitted that [...] "Harlem, the character that we’re trying to create, does resemble Harlem <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> ten years ago." [...] Coker said that Harlem was a world for the series, but also [...] "all about legacy too. Harlem is filled with moments of history." [...] He wanted to replicate the experience of walking through Harlem and hearing different music coming from every car driving past, and every open window, which he felt was unique to the neighborhood. Coker further described the Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the series' Iron Throne, and wanted it to [...] "invoke the history of Harlem ... it’s crime, politics, music, really the whole cornucopia of the black creative existence in one place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries, Jones {{stuck with}} country music with a vengeance. [...] Jones never reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and almost never had any of his music played on {{mainstream}} popular music stations in his career. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters {{from a wide range}} of genres. [...] In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones [...] "the second best singer in America". [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'," [...] and in his autobiography Chronicles, Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits [...] "Outside <b>of</b> <b>maybe</b> George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either." [...] Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song [...] "That's All It Took" [...] on his first solo album. [...] In the documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song [...] "She Once Lived Here" [...] at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: [...] "It was my peak, peak moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment." [...] Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, [...] "He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone I can call to mind. [...] You heard his heart in every note he sang." [...] Richards recorded [...] "Say It's Not You" [...] with Jones for The Bradley Barn Sessions in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: [...] "They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. [...] Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there." [...] In the documentary The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. [...] John Prine mentions Jones in his song [...] "Jesus the Missing Years". [...] Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered [...] "A Good Year For The Roses" [...] in 1981. [...] Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: [...] "George Jones would be singing all the time. [...] It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other for no reason at all, and it would smell good." [...] In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from Rolling Stone, Leonard Cohen asked, [...] "Have you heard George Jones' last record Cold Hard Truth? [...] I love to hear an old guy lay out his situation. [...] He has the best voice in America," [...] and the day Jones died, Cohen performed [...] "Choices" [...] on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. [...] In 2013, Robbie Robertson told Uncut, [...] "He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in The Band, but we'd listen to George Jones..." [...] Robert Plant told Uncuts Michael Bonner in 2014, [...] "I now have to listen to George Jones once a day. [...] Amazing singer. [...] What a singer." [...] James Taylor, who wrote [...] "Bartender's Blues" [...] with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told Rolling Stone, [...] "He sounds like a steel guitar. [...] It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. [...] The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice." [...] Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King, Blackberry Smoke and Linda Ronstadt. [...] In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, [...] "He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies." ...|$|E
