5|$|Rigoberto Herrera, {{a member}} of the Cuban {{national}} team who had retired and accompanied the team from Cuba as a guest, defected to the United States during the visit. Though six retired players <b>overslept</b> the day after the game in Baltimore and missed their flight back to Cuba, no other members of the delegation defected.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{services}} featured in the film were one-off events. For example, the wedding was shot at Lyng, where the bride's father was the rector. The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, ruining the sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on Easter Sunday at the most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the sound recordist <b>overslept.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had <b>overslept</b> after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E

25|$|Soul group The Four Tops, having {{completed}} their European tour, had Pan Am Flight 103 as a return {{flight to the}} United States for Christmas. A later British Airways flight became their remedy when they <b>overslept</b> following a Top of the Pops performance.|$|E
25|$|Rix had {{his most}} {{successful}} season in 2003 {{when he passed}} for 3,107yards and 23 touchdowns. He ranks second in school history in passes attempted, completed, and touchdowns thrown. Rix missed the 2003 Sugar Bowl after he <b>overslept</b> and missed an exam, subsequently causing him to be suspended for the game.|$|E
25|$|On the 26th Heraugiere {{and their}} men {{embarked}} on van Bergen's boat; {{but he was}} too ill or <b>overslept</b> and thus sent his two nephews who would pilot the barge. Overcoming the Mark in the direction of Breda, they had to overcome the extreme cold of the Dutch winter, ice caused difficulties thus making navigation difficult which delayed the voyage by a number of days. By Saturday evening however they had reached Breda and were at the outer gates early in the morning.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 29 January, Khiêm ordered troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon, including armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions. Khánh then went to sleep. Khánh headed to the staff headquarters, where {{he saw that the}} compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had <b>overslept</b> after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over without a shot being fired. Generals Dương Văn Minh, Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim woke up to find Khiêm's men surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers, having had no inkling of the plot. Khánh put them under house arrest, later charging them with neutralism. In a morning radio broadcast Khánh said he had conducted the coup because of the junta's failure to make progress against the Viet Cong. After the coup, Khiêm became Defense Minister and the Chairman of Joint General Staff while serving on the junta.|$|E
25|$|Waugh and Mark Taylor {{opened on}} debut against Tasmania at Hobart's TCA Ground. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was {{dismissed}} for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 {{in the first}} innings. He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair <b>overslept</b> on Taylor's 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding driils, forcing the pair to take hundreds of catches. His took his first catch, that of Roger Woolley on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler Merv Hughes in the next match against Victoria and then 17 and a run out for another duck against the touring New Zealand. With a first-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped {{for the next five}} matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line fast bowler and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against Queensland in his first match in the role. They were his first-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with Mike Whitney, due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings. Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again for the Sheffield Shielf final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales' only pacemen, and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with Greg Dyer to help avoid the follow on with 41. Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season. He played in one limited-overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Broke". In the first 90-second clip, Michael is running late because he <b>overslept,</b> and he instinctively {{runs into the}} Dunder Mifflin office by accident instead of his Michael Scott Paper Company office. In the second one-minute clip, Andy is angry that he cannot find his personalized coffee mug with his face on it, and {{he and the others}} around the office complain about losing their clients to Michael's new company. In the final 80-second clip, stress drives Ryan to the breaking point and he begins trashing the Michael Scott Paper Company Office, for which he quickly recovers and apologizes.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also the subject of {{criticism}} for its portrayal of the September 11 attacks, in which Brian and Stewie {{go back in time}} to make the attacks happen again, ultimately resulting in a high five when they are successful (despite Stewie immediately remarking that would sound terrible out of context). The Daily Mail reported on the episode writing, [...] "Nothing is ever off limits for Family Guy and its creator Seth MacFarlane. No topic is taboo, not the Holocaust, not drunk driving and not even abortion, but last night's episode may finally have crossed the line." [...] Terri Pous [...] of Time also wrote of the episode, [...] "It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid Family Guy viewers live for [...] "too soon" [...] moments, no matter how sensitive the material." [...] Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of Entertainment Weekly, also thought the show had gone too far with the reference. Nellie Andreeva of Deadline also commented that it [...] "squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows." [...] MacFarlane was scheduled to be on one of the planes that hit the Twin Towers but <b>overslept</b> allegedly due to being hungover.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} {{administrative}} difficulties during the tour. Bill Dowling—the {{chairman of the}} Australian Board of Control—had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6,500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities. The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour, as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales. Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches, the locals made a matting surface for the First Test. During the Second Test, when asked by General Ayub Khan—head of the ruling military junta—why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia, Loxton exploited the opportunity {{to complain about the}} wickets. When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test, Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non-turf surfaces. The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur, when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time. An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not [...] "spoil a beautiful friendship over money", to which the Australian manager replied [...] "Try me. I want it please...You know the rules." [...] The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered, and India inflicted Australia's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors. Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men, having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had <b>overslept</b> and been left behind by the team bus. During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca, one of the umpires took off his shoes {{and put them on the}} ground while play was in progress. Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities, asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire’s loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder’s hands. However, he never received a reply.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1915, Kern {{was due to}} sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London {{on board}} the RMS Lusitania, but Kern missed the boat, having <b>overslept</b> after staying up late playing poker. [...] Frohman died in {{the sinking of the}} ship.|$|E
2500|$|On December 9, 1956, Jones <b>overslept</b> his {{scheduled}} morning {{flight from}} Vancouver, so he scheduled an afternoon flight {{to stop at}} Calgary then travel to Winnipeg.

2500|$|In the 1976 film Network, the {{character}} Max Schumacher (William Holden) tells {{a funny story}} to his friend Howard Beale (Peter Finch), in which the young Schumacher, who <b>overslept</b> for a news shoot about the new lower deck at the bridge, gets into a cab wearing a raincoat over his pajamas and tells the cabbie to: [...] "Take me {{to the middle of}} the George Washington Bridge." [...] The cabbie, concerned that Schumacher intended to jump from the bridge, turns around and begs him: [...] "Don't do it buddy! You're a young man! You got your whole life ahead of you!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At about 3:30p.m. EDT on Saturday, June 23, fellow wrestler {{and close}} friend Chavo Guerrero {{received}} a voicemail message from Benoit's phone stating {{that he had}} <b>overslept</b> and missed his flight and would be late for that night's house show in Beaumont, Texas. Guerrero called Benoit back and found that Benoit sounded tired and groggy as he confirmed everything that he had said in his voice message. Guerrero, who was [...] "concerned about Benoit's tone and demeanor," [...] called him back 12 minutes later. Benoit did not answer the call, and Guerrero left a message asking Benoit to call back.|$|E
2500|$|Before dawn on 30 January, Khánh {{surrounded}} the military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. Meanwhile, Khiêm had <b>overslept</b> {{when he was}} supposed to seal off the homes of the junta members. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot having been fired. In his first radio broadcast on the same morning, Khánh assailed the MRC's performance during its three months at the top. He said, [...] "The political, economic, and social situation in the countryside still offers no promising prospect. There has not been one single compensation worthy of the sacrifices accepted daily by the soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Ethel Rogers, the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife, {{described}} as a pale and ghost-like woman who walks in mortal fear. She was dominated by her bullying husband, who coerced her into agreeing to withhold the medicine of a former employer (Miss Jennifer Brady, an elderly spinster) in order that they might collect an inheritance they knew she had left them in her will. Mrs Rogers was haunted by the crime {{for the rest of}} her life, and was the second victim, dying in her sleep from an overdose of chloral hydrate in her brandy. ("One <b>overslept</b> himself ...") ...|$|E
2500|$|The DVD also {{includes}} several [...] "Easter eggs" [...] including: {{a version of}} a State of the Union Address by George W. Bush, edited to make United States policy seem insanely belligerent; a new audio discussion between Morris and Alan Partridge discussing Partridge's bizarre theories of how Diana, Princess of Wales, and John F. Kennedy died; a further discussion between Morris and Partridge about the environment; a re-union of Morris, Partridge, Brant, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, Collaterlie Sisters and Valerie Sinatra; and another audio sketch featuring Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan pretending to file {{a report from the}} World Trade Center covering up {{the fact that he had}} <b>overslept,</b> while blithely unaware that the September 11, 2001 attacks have just taken place. Pressing the Angle button during Episode 3 unveils brief, intermittent visual descriptions of the episode by Andy Hodgson and Jennifer Reinfrank, whilst a half-hour interview with Steve Coogan, conducted by Mark Radcliffe on 17 January 1994 edition of his radio show, can be accessed through the Extended Scenes menu.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Park saw Kaelin come {{from the back of}} the {{property}} to the front, Park testified that he saw [...] "a tall black man" [...] of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call. Simpson explained that he had <b>overslept</b> and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at Los Angeles International Airport who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.|$|E
2500|$|During 1980, Orndorff {{started to}} split {{his time between}} the Alabama and the Mid-South territories, until he left the Alabama {{territory}} {{by the end of}} 1980 to focus entirely on the Mid-South territory. In Mid-South, Orndorff feuded with Ken Mantell over Mantell's propensity for cutting people's hair after a match. Orndorff got the better of Mantell and won the rights to use the Freebird hair removal cream on Mantell. Orndorff earned a shot at the North American champion The Grappler but {{on the day of the}} match he <b>overslept</b> (storyline) and was incensed when his replacement Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts beat the Grappler for the title. Orndorff's reaction to Jake's title win signaled a change in attitude; he turned heel as he demanded a title match against Jake [...] "the Snake". While he lost the support of the fans, he won the North American title on July 4, 1981. Orndorff feuded with Ted DiBiase, JYD, Dusty Rhodes, and Dick Murdoch while holding on to the North American title. Orndorff lost the title to Ted DiBiase on November 1, 1981 in a match at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans, Louisiana. Orndorff was unable to wrestle in the rematch due to car trouble, which meant that Orndorff's friend Bob Roop got the title shot and won the match. It was soon revealed that Roop had sabotaged Orndorff's car so he could get the title shot instead (storyline). Orndorff turned face to feud with Roop but found himself unable to regain the title after which he left the Mid-South Territory.|$|E
