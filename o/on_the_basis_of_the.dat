5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aesthetics {{paradox is}} one of the ways of defamiliarization and {{creating}} language aesthetics and is not related to concepts, but it contains vocables which contradict somehow (Vahidian, 1376 : 284). In aesthetic paradox, the poets can convey themselves in a simple way, for example, instead of "Atash dar Atash Zadan", "Nabood Kardan Atash", "Azad bodan Asiir" "Azad bodan Asheg”, “Tagreebe jodaiee”, “fararesidan jodaiee" and "jameh Parishan" instead of "gorohe parishan". They often conveyed this through paradox to stimulate the readers. By this the reader tries to get the fact beyond this. The reader tries to enjoy from discovering this fact and store that in his mind. The paradox can be divided into two parts structurely 1 -     Exional e. g: Bikhabar Ra Saheebe Khabar Danestan", "Bishee Rar Dar Kamii Danestan" 2 -     Syntactical e. g. : "Rahee BiRahii", "Zabane Bizabanie”   1. Paradox through exion: Sometimes paradox in the concept of one verse or one half verse {{is in the form of}} exions. Such images, in comparison to syntactic paradox has more artistic value. Most aesthetics paradoxes in Persian Literature are exional. Exional paradox is divided into seven kinds. 1. 1.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 1. 2.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 1. 3.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 1. 4.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 1. 5.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 1. 6.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 1. 7.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric These rhetorical and figurative language practices are inherently beautiful but when they are conveyed through paradox, their effects are increased several times.   1. 1. <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor In this type of contradiction, view of aesthetics mosta’ar is chosen to be in contradiction with a word in poetry and by eliminating moshabah-on-beh, contradiction is clear: (Given example – Hafeez 1835 : 192) 1. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile: In this type of contradictory view such vehicle is chosen to be in contradiction with the word poetry and with the removal of this vehicle, contradiction is clear. (Given example- Khaganie, 1367 : 699).   2. Paradox in the form of syntactic In this rhetorical art two sides of one coin of a combination violate each other in terms of the concept (Shaffiee- 1370 : 37 for example aabe khoshk, atashe abdar, …. In these combinations, there are paradox and contradiction in term of concepts. Although such contradictions are fault in the Logic, they are excellent in Persian Literature. This type of application is frequent. Synthetic paradoxes are also seven kinds. 2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 2. 3. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 2. 4. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 2. 5. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 2. 6. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 2. 7. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric   2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Allegory Here it is allowed to put the synonymous instead of a word. This synonym is in contradiction with that word in one concept, but in central meaning has consistency. For e. g. jogdea Homayon (Saee 1375, first vol. 258)   2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images In this exponential contradictory of aesthetic, these vehicles are chosen in the way that they create paradox in poetry and by eliminating them, this contradiction is clear (Given example, Khaganii, 1367 : 368) ...|$|R
