5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and <b>ophthalmology</b> practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of <b>Ophthalmology</b> on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.

Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of <b>Ophthalmology,</b> experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
