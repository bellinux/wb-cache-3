25|$|Water purification: All {{water used}} for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, <b>ozone</b> <b>water</b> treatment, {{ultraviolet}} light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration {{in any area}} where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.|$|E

Ozone in the stratosphere shields us from the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, making life on Earth possible; that in the troposphere acts as a strong greenhouse gas and an environmental pollutant. Water vapor in the upper troposphere is a main emitter of the Earth's infrared radiation, controlling the Earth's radiative balance; that in the lower stratosphere affects the stratospheric ozone photochemistry and {{the recovery of the}} stratospheric ozone depletion.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the effective and efficient use of <b>ozone</b> in cooling <b>water</b> treatment systems. The study focuses on proving that ozone treated systems will: (1) Improve compressor energy consumption; (2) Improve the heat exchangers efficiency through limited scale deposition and fouling; (3) Reduce water consumption; and (4) Encourage or support corrosion at high concentrations compared to when cooling water is chemically treated. For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical cooling water treatment systems showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, <b>ozone</b> cooling <b>water</b> treatment systems showed a lower approach temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from cooling water flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In <b>ozone</b> cooling <b>water</b> treatment systems, there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In cooling water treatment systems with good quality makeup <b>water,</b> <b>ozone</b> treated systems were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems. It can be concluded that effective and efficient use of <b>ozone</b> in cooling <b>water</b> treatment provides triple bottom line benefits (economic, social and environmental). Environmental benefits include effluent disposal reduction, water and energy conservation. Social benefits include safety and health impacts. <b>Ozone</b> treated cooling <b>water</b> systems are a technically practical, cost-effective and sensible alternative when compared to conventional cooling water treatment systems...|$|R

The MOZAIC program (Measurement of <b>OZone</b> and <b>water</b> vapour by AIrbus {{in-service}} airCraft) {{was initiated}} in 1993 by European scientists, aircraft manufacturers and airlines to collect experimental data. Its {{goal is to}} help understand the atmosphere and how it is changing under the influence of human activity, with particular interest in the effects of aircraft. MOZAIC consists of automatic and regular measurements of <b>ozone</b> and <b>water</b> vapour by five long range passenger airliners flying all over the world. The aim is to build a large database of measurements to allow studies of chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, and hence to validate global chemistry transport models. MOZAIC data provide, in particular, detailed <b>ozone</b> and <b>water</b> vapour climatologies at 9-12 km where subsonic aircraft emit most of their exhaust and which is a very critical domain (e.g. radiatively and S/T exchanges) still imperfectly described in existing models.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that conventional radiosondes equipped with a traditional pressure sensor can be subject to a pressure bias, particularly in the stratosphere. This study examines this pressure bias and the resulting altitude misestimation, and its impact on temperature, <b>ozone,</b> and <b>water</b> vapor profiles is considered using data obtained between December 2003 and January 2010 during the Soundings of <b>Ozone</b> and <b>Water</b> in the Equatorial Region (SOWER) campaigns. The payload consisted of a radiosonde (Vaisala RS 80), <b>ozone</b> and <b>water</b> vapor sondes, and a global positioning system (GPS) sensor. More than 30 soundings are used in this study. As GPS height data are thought to be highly accurate, they can be used to calculate pressure. The RS 80 pressure bias in the tropical stratosphere is estimated to be - 0. 4 ± 0. 2 hPa (1 σ) between 20 and 30 km. As this pressure bias is negative throughout the stratosphere, it leads to systematic overestimation of geopotential height by 43 ± 23, 110 ± 40, and 240 ± 92 m (1 σ) at 20, 25, and 30 km, respectively when it is calculated by using the hypsometric equation. Because of the altitude overestimation, we see some offsets in observation parameters having a vertical gradient such as temperature, <b>ozone,</b> and <b>water</b> vapor. Those offsets in the meteorological soundings obtained using the RS 80 may have generated an artificial trend in the meteorological records when radiosondes were changed from the RS 80, which had no GPS unit, to the new ones with a GPS unit. Therefore, it is important to take those offsets into account in climate change studies...|$|R
