25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping).</b> As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

Background: A number of strategy documents have recommended adopting a more integrated approach to sexual health service provision. One proposed model of integration is <b>one-stop</b> <b>shops,</b> where services for contraception and sexually transmitted infections are provided under the same roof. Currently, {{the potential impact of}} <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> services on patient service use and preference is unclear, particularly at a population level.
