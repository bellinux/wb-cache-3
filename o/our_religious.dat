500|$|With fellow Scientology {{attorney}} Helena Kobrin, Moxon {{filed an}} affidavit in Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court in March 2000, complaining {{to the judge}} about the criminal prosecution of the Church of Scientology related {{to the death of}} Lisa McPherson. They claimed that the prosecution held an [...] "extreme religious bias" [...] and a [...] "narrow-minded concept of a church". They defended the practice of the Scientology staffers that had kept Lisa McPherson at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, asserting they had been involved in the [...] "Introspection Rundown", which they called an [...] "entirely religious" [...] practice developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. They wrote that [...] "Forcing a Scientologist to receive psychiatric services would be like forcing an Orthodox Jew to eat pork or forcing a devoted Catholic to have an abortion. It is simply unacceptable and unthinkable to <b>our</b> <b>religious</b> faith and conscience." [...] Moxon said that the wrongful death lawsuit filed by members of McPherson's family against the Church of Scientology was [...] "nothing more than a vehicle to say bad things about the church". The criminal prosecution in the Lisa McPherson case was dropped due to issues with record-keeping by the medical examiner; a wrongful death civil suit was settled in 2004.|$|E

Later, he attended Millbrook, a Protestant school, but was permitted to attend Catholic Mass at a nearby church.

[...] At least one columnist claimed that this change would allow teachers to force students to pray to their specific deity with no possibility of damages or attorney's fees. In other words, only those who could afford to hire an attorney to challenge the practice would be able to object in court. Since monetary damages were precluded, the only remedy would be an injunction.|$|E

2500|$|Unger's call {{is for a}} {{revolution}} in <b>our</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change {{in the life of}} the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. [...] "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity."

He says members should encourage those with AIDS to participate in church activities. He also seems to contradict Faust's address from a month earlier by giving a nuanced view on potential biological components of the etiology of homosexuality stating [...] "some kinds of feelings seem to be inborn" [...] while others [...] "seem to be acquired from a complex interaction of 'nature and nurture,". He continues, [...] "the feelings ... that increase susceptibility to certain behavior may have some relationship to inheritance". However, Oaks discourages members from calling themselves or other people lesbian or gay saying, [...] "we should refrain from using [...] as nouns to identify specific persons. <b>Our</b> <b>religious</b> doctrine dictates this usage.
