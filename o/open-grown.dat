2500|$|Sapwood (or alburnum) is the younger, {{outermost}} wood; in {{the growing}} tree it is living wood, and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, {{by the time they}} become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, [...] or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth hickory, or <b>open-grown</b> pines.|$|E

50|$|Seed {{production}} starts {{when the}} trees are about 30 years old, and optimum seed-bearing age is 50 to 125 years. Good seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years. As many as 70 liters (2 bu) can be produced by an <b>open-grown</b> tree. Seeds are disseminated by various methods, including squirrels and water.|$|E
50|$|Two {{possible}} mature specimens {{stood before}} Wright's Houses, Bruntsfield Links, Edinburgh (one survives, 2016). Despite being unpollarded <b>open-grown</b> trees, their branches were mostly steeply ascending, the fastigiate tendency being noticeable also in branchlets.

50|$|White poplar {{requires}} abundant {{light and}} ample moisture, and stands up well to flood water and slightly acidic soils. Its green-and-white leaves {{makes it an}} effective ornamental tree but the root suckers may cause problems in some situations. It is very attractive as an <b>open-grown</b> tree in water meadows, and, because of its extensive root system and tolerance of salt, is also planted to strengthen coastal sand dunes.|$|E
50|$|In forest conditions, old {{individuals}} {{typically have}} a narrow, cylindric crown beginning 20 - 40 m above a branch-free trunk. Self-pruning is generally slow and trees retain their lower limbs {{for a long}} period. Young, <b>open-grown</b> trees typically have branches down to near ground level. It often takes 70-80 years for the trunk to be clear to a height of 5 m and 100 years to be clear to a height of 10 m.|$|E
50|$|It is this {{distinctive}} growth {{form that}} is so valued in the <b>open-grown</b> American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement.

50|$|At Kew, Melville {{dismissed}} the tree there labelled Ulmus × hollandica 'Wentworthii' as simply U. × vegeta (the lower branches of <b>open-grown</b> Huntingdon elms {{can also be}} pendulous), though Wentworth differs in form, leaf and bark from true Huntingdon (see Description below). While Richens and Rackham noted that examples of pendulous Ulmus × hollandica occur in the East Anglian hybridization zone, 'Wentworthii Pendula' is the only known large weeping-elm cultivar, pendulous also from upper branches, dating from the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|In areas {{unaffected}} by Dutch elm disease, 'Major' often attains {{a height of}} > 30 m, with a short bole and irregular, wide-spreading branches. In <b>open-grown</b> specimens, the canopy is less dense {{than that of the}} English elm or Wych elm. The bark of the trunk is dark and deeply fissured and, like English elm, forms irregular 'plates' in mature specimens, serving to distinguish it from the Huntingdon Elm (latticed bark), the other commonly planted U. × hollandica in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Quercus pubescens is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree growing up to 20 m. Forest-grown trees grow tall, while open-growing trees develop {{a very broad}} and irregular crown. They are long-lived, to several hundred years, and eventually grow into very stout trees with trunks up to 2 m in diameter. <b>Open-grown</b> trees frequently develop several trunks. The bark is very rough, light grey and divided into small flakes. Large trees develop very thick whitish bark cracked into deep furrows, similar to the Pedunculate oak but lighter in colour.|$|E
50|$|Mature English Elms are {{now only}} very rarely {{found in the}} UK beyond Brighton (see below) and Edinburgh. One large tree survives in Leicester in Cossington Street Recreation Ground. Several survive in Edinburgh (2015): one in Rosebank Cemetery (girth 3 metres), one in Founders Avenue, Fettes College, and one in Inverleith Park (east avenue), while a majestic <b>open-grown</b> {{specimen}} (3 metres) in Claremont Park, Leith Links, retains the dense fan-vaulted crown iconic in this cultivar.

The large teeth are present along the whole leaf-margin of short shoot-leaves {{as well as}} long (see 'Cornuta'). Though 'Cornuta'-like teeth may occur near the apex, they are rare, and do not resemble the slender 'horns' that usually appear in 'Cornuta' photographs. The tree is narrow-pyramidal, with upswept branches like a Huntingdon Elm.|$|E
50|$|Appreciable seed {{production}} begins at 20-30 years in <b>open-grown</b> coast Douglas-fir. Seed production is irregular; over a 5-7 year period, stands usually produce one heavy crop, a few light or medium crops, and one crop failure. Even during heavy seed crop years, only about 25 percent {{of trees in}} closed stands produce an appreciable number of cones. Each cone contains around 25 to 50 seeds. Seed size varies; average number of cleaned seeds varies from 70-88/g (32,000-40,000 per pound). Seeds from the northern portion of coast Douglas-fir's range tend to be larger than seed from the south.|$|E

50|$|In many forests, this {{deciduous}} tree grows {{straight and}} tall, to 28 m, exceptionally to 43 m tall, with a trunk {{of up to}} 50 - 100 cm diameter. <b>Open-grown</b> trees do not get as tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to 2 m in diameter. It has stout branches growing {{at right angles to}} the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head. It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams. It is frequently a part of the canopy in an oak-heath forest, but generally not as important as some other oaks.|$|E

50|$|Tamarack is monoecious. Male {{and female}} cones are small, either solitary or {{in groups of}} 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male cones are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female cones {{resemble}} tiny roses. They are reddish/maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree. They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On <b>open-grown</b> trees, cones are borne on {{all parts of the}} crown. Mature seed cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and 13 to 19 mm (½ to ¾ in) long.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, American elm {{was a common}} street and park tree owing to its {{tolerance}} of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy monoculture of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests. These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use {{before the advent of}} Dutch elm disease. Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between <b>open-grown</b> and forest-grown American elms, noted that: In the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.|$|E

50|$|Slash weight (the {{oven-dry}} {{weight of}} the entire crown and {{that portion of the}} stem < 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the forest fire hazard on harvested sites. Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968). In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (<1.27 cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; <b>open-grown</b> trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wych elm}} {{sometimes}} reaches heights of 40 m, typically {{with a broad}} crown where <b>open-grown,</b> supported by a short bole < 2 m. d.b.h. There are not normally root suckers; natural reproduction is by seed alone. The tree is notable for its very tough, supple young shoots, which are always without the corky ridges or wings characteristic of many elms. The alternate leaves are deciduous, 6 - 17 cm long by 3 - 12 cm broad, usually obovate with an asymmetric base, the lobe often completely covering the short (<5 mm) petiole; the upper surface is rough. Leaves on juvenile or shade-grown shoots sometimes have three or more lobes near the apex. The perfect hermaphrodite flowers appear before the leaves in early spring, produced in clusters of 10 - 20; they are 4 mm across on 10 mm long stems and, being wind-pollinated, are apetalous.

50|$|The spruce bud moths of {{the genus}} Zeiraphera, transcontinental in range, are found {{frequently}} on white spruce but only occasionally on other spruces and firs (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Zeiraphera canadensis (Mutuura and Freeman Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has caused {{a high incidence of}} multiple and abnormal leaders in white spruce in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and Maine (Quiring et al. 1991). However, although severe feeding damage has seldom been extensive in forests, new shoots on <b>open-grown</b> white spruce are frequently disfigured (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The insect overwinters in the egg stage on the tree. The larva emerges in May and feeds underneath the bud cap, which it characteristically secures to the growing shoot with silk. The cap remains in place long after the other bud caps have been shed, an obvious impediment to the effectiveness of contact insecticides. When populations are high, it is not unusual to find several larvae feeding among the needles of a single shoot. The head and thoracic legs of young larvae are dark brown, but full-grown larvae are cream to yellow and about 10 mm long. Feeding is completed in June or early July, whereupon the larva drops to the ground and becomes a pupa in the litter. From mid-July to mid-August, moths emerge from the pupae to lay eggs singly or in groups of two to seven at the base of shoots of the current year. In a New Brunswick seed orchard, white spruce of intermediate height (1.5 to 3.73 m) were damaged most, and damage in one year was positively correlated with damage in the next. At four test sites, mean growth reduction of trees in the two most susceptible families was estimated to be approximately 30% higher than those of trees in the two least susceptible families. The lack of damage to some trees, among those trees suffering damage, suggested the existence of genetically based differences in susceptibility to this pest.|$|E

For <b>open-grown</b> trees, assessing parameters like stem taper, which is commonly associated with different modes of failure (Nykänen et al. 1997; van Dyke 1999; Zhu et al. 2006), is difficult.

30|$|The main {{driver of}} branch failure {{in our work}} {{appeared}} to be accumulation of snow, expedited {{by the presence of}} leaves and the inability of larger, less flexible branches to shed it.

We justify this approach given our objectives (to explore general trends among species—our work is the first to examine snow-induced failure of <b>open-grown</b> trees in urbanized areas), and because time constraints required that multiple observers collected data prior to removal of damaged branches. Our results provide a useful foundation for subsequent work to investigate in greater detail snow- and ice-induced branch failures of <b>open-grown</b> trees in urbanized areas.
