50|$|In June 2015, Housing.com then-CEO Rahul Yadav accused Sequoia India MD Shailendra Singh of {{poaching}} Housing.com staff. Subsequently, he {{was asked}} to leave the company altogether, citing <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Rishabh Gupta was temporarily in charge, before being replaced by Jason Kothari in November 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The {{implication}} {{from the}} narrative is that Onan's act as described is what {{gave rise to}} divine displeasure, but even {{if that is the}} case it is not clear whether his <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> was the refusal to complete the levirate obligation of providing sperm for his brother's widow to continue his brother's name (and clan rights) or [...] "shedding seed in vain", or even having sex with Tamar (who would normally be prohibited to him as a sister-in-law) outside the context of an overriding levirate obligation.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a case where}} the top management of a small holding company is involved in a love-hate relationship with its own IT department. The top management firmly believes that IT staff is involved in leaking out company’s secrets. However, having no expertise in IT and even lesser grasp on the complexity of IT architecture resulting from recent mergers and acquisition, the top management finds itself crucially dependent on its IT systems, yet unable to trust them fully. The theories of deterrence and reasoned action are used to explain the otherwise <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the perpetrator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} primary school staff members’ {{interpretations of the}} UK social and {{emotional}} learning initiative: SEAL. The data, collected through group and individual interviews with a range of staff members working in schools located in deprived areas, illustrate how the scheme has been used to encourage various behaviours. This utilisation of SEAL was influenced by staff members’ perceptions of the pupils’ parents, and particularly their in/ability to develop ‘appropriate’ social, emotional and behavioural skills. Staff members identified a range of <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviours,</b> exhibited by the pupils, which were perceived to have been encouraged in the home. In response, schools operationalised SEAL to endorse alternative behaviours deemed ‘appropriate’. Implications of the findings, in terms of marginalising the values and ‘othering’ the practices of specific sections of society, are discussed, and recommendations are made for a more democratic approach to schooling which prioritises a mutual exchange of knowledge between school and home...|$|R
40|$|As a {{genre of}} mass media, the romance movie has the {{potential}} to influence and shape audience’s views on socio-cultural issues of the time (Rahman, 2013). Asian romance movies often depict behaviours that challenge their moral code such as obeying authority, adherence to cultural norms and putting society before self. For dramatic effect, such movies would often showcase scandalous themes and socially <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviours</b> which are eventually resolved, indicating a return to socially accepted codes of conduct. There is a clear appreciation of values considered ideal in romantic partnerships including honesty and fidelity. Interestingly, such movies appear to capture the Asian diaspora, challenging social norms and negotiating its values, behaviours and beliefs against foreign elements. This article explores the scandals and consequences portrayed in some of these Asian movies, evaluating the effect that this might have on its actors and a receptive audience. Elements of scandal in the personal lives of some of the actors make a case for life and art imitating the other in a cycle of challenge, compromise and conformity...|$|R
2500|$|Corbyn was {{selected}} as the Labour Party candidate for the constituency of Islington North, in February 1982, winning the final ballot by 39 votes against 35 for GLC councillor Paul Boateng. At the 1983 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Islington North, after defeating the incumbent Michael O'Halloran and immediately joined the socialist Campaign Group, later becoming [...] secretary of the group. Shortly after being elected to parliament, he began writing a weekly column for the Morning Star. In May 2015, he said that [...] "the Star is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media". In February 2017, Morning Star said about Corbyn: [...] "He has been bullied, betrayed and ridiculed, and yet he carries on with the same grace and care he always shows to others - however <b>objectionable</b> their <b>behaviour</b> and treatment of him might be." ...|$|R
30|$|This {{observation}} {{becomes more}} paradoxical as {{one considers the}} data provided by {{the analysis of the}} youngest children’ responses. In this respect, the 4 – 5 [*]year old children show the most significant lack of understanding of what a living being is. This conclusion comes mainly from the quantitative data previously presented but it may be also interesting {{to point out that the}} researcher observed, when interviewing the children, that the youngest subjects felt confused and puzzled when attempting to answer the living/non-living distinction test. Despite this fact, the data also indicates that there is no difference among the three age groups concerning the belief that damaging a flower or a tree is more <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> than nose picking or regrettable table manners.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} fictional doctors with unappealing {{character}} traits {{have become a}} trope of television depictions of medical settings: the eponymous Dr House who misanthropy extends to both patients and colleagues. Dr Cox of the hospital-set comedy Scrubs who bitter tirades reduce his subordinates to tears, and the curmudgeonly 'Doc Martin', a rural GP whose gruff demeanour perplexes and offends his patients, to give a few examples. But despite their <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour,</b> these characters are simultaneously presented as brilliant doctors whose diagnostic wizardry and cool-head in a medical crisis more than makes up for their lack of a pleasing bedside manner. In reality we are less compromising, and while technical knowledge and clinical competency are of course crucial attributes of the good doctor, we are also concerned with doctors' manner and behaviour - with their character...|$|E
40|$|Political {{disputes}} over toleration are endemic, while toleration {{as a political}} value seems opposed to those of civic equality, neutrality and sometimes democracy. Toleration in Political Conflict sets out to understand toleration as both politically awkward and indispensable. The book exposes the incoherence of Rawlsian reasonable pluralist justifications of toleration, and shows that toleration cannot be fully reconciled with liberal political values. While raison d'état concerns very often overshadow debates over toleration, these debates - for example about terrorism - need not be framed as a conflict between toleration and security. Framing them in this way tends to obscure <b>objectionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> by tolerators themselves, and their reliance on asymmetric power. Glen Newey concludes by sketching a picture of politics as dependent on free speech which, he argues, is entailed by the demands of free association. That in turn suggests that questions of toleration are inescapable within the conditions of politics itself. SCOPUS: bk. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
