To begin assessment, the normal range of human breath ammonia was defined via photoacoustic laser spectroscopy (PALS) which identified baseline concentrations to be from 29 to 688 ppb. Following this, a system was developed to simulate breath interferents such as humidity and temperature over a human range encompassing normal and abnormal breath ammonia concentrations (18 to 2, 993 ppb). This instrumentation assisted in evaluating the performance of an ammonia sensitive electrode based on print-fabrication technology and polyaniline nanoparticles. The electrodes displayed an intra-variability from 0. 05 to 1. 67 %, and generated a 0. 99 correlation across a range of 40 to 2, 175 ppbv ammonia (LOD= 6. 3 ppbv) fulfilling the analytical and biomedical requirements necessary for sensing ammonia in exhaled breath.

Chapter 1 introduces the reasons for investigating <b>optical</b> <b>ammonia</b> sensors. It highlights the advantage of fluorescence-based optical sensors and discusses the theoretical basics and sensor platform technologies connected to this topic. Chapter 2 focuses on the development of an <b>optical</b> planar waveguide <b>ammonia</b> gas sensor, the sensing mechanism of which is based on FRET between coumarin and fluorescein. The dyes were immobilized into an organically modified silicate matrix during polymerizing methyltriethoxysilane with trifluoropropyl-trimethoxysilane on a PMMA substrate. The resulting dye-doped xerogel films were exposed to different gaseous ammonia concentrations. A logarithmic decrease in coumarin fluorescence emission intensity was observed with increasing ammonia concentration. The coumarin/fluorescein composition was optimized in order to obtain the best ammonia sensitivity. Experiments in the gas sensor setup demonstrated a sensitive and reversible response of the xerogel films to gaseous ammonia. Chapter 3 reports on the development of silica particle impregnated xerogel sensor coatings on PMMA substrates. Fluorescein and rhodamine B labelled mesoporous silica particles were synthesized by post-grafting and co-condensation approaches. The resulting materials exhibited different pore size distributions, particle shapes and sizes. The Förster resonance energy transfer between this dye pair was explored for the different materials by exposure to various concentrations of gaseous ammonia. A logarithmic increase in rhodamine B emission intensity with increasing ammonia concentration was observed for both post-grafted and co-condensed materials. The dye accessibility by ammonia gas in the silica framework was evaluated by the same gas sensor setup reported in Chapter 2. The response to ammonia gas and the recovery with nitrogen gas is explained by comparing the structure properties and dye loading of the materials.

Recent controls {{to reduce the}} emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOX and NOX) have increased the importance of understanding the role ammonia plays {{in the formation of}} surface fine inorganic particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in the United States. In this study, we identify the interannual variability in ammonia concentration, explore the sources of this variability and determine their contribution to the variability in surface PM 2. 5 concentration. Over the summers of 2008 - 2012, measurements from the <b>Ammonia</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Network (AMoN) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite instrument show considerable variability in both surface and column ammonia concentrations (+/- 29 % and 28 % of the mean), respectively.

The condition is multifactorial and may involve both oral and non-oral conditions. SOURCES: A private, monthly with keywords halitosis, malodo(u) r, (a) etiology, measurement, and management from Medline and Pubmed updated database of literature was reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: In approximately 80 - 90 % of all cases, halitosis is caused by oral conditions, defined as oral malodour. Oral malodour results from tongue coating, periodontal disease, peri-implant disease, deep carious lesions, exposed necrotic tooth pulps, pericoronitis, mucosal ulcerations, healing (mucosal) wounds, impacted food or debris, imperfect dental restorations, unclean dentures, and factors causing decreased salivary flow rate. The basic process is microbial degradation of organic substrates. Non-oral aetiologies of halitosis include disturbances of {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tract, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, some systemic diseases, metabolic disorders, medications, and carcinomas. Stressful situations are predisposing factors. There are three primary measurement methods of halitosis. Organoleptic measurement and gas chromatography are very reliable, but not very easily clinically implemented methods. The use of organoleptic measurement is suggested as the 'gold standard'. Gas chromatography is the preferable method if precise measurements of specific gases are required. Sulphide monitoring is an easily used method, but has the limitation that important odours are not detected.

Ammonia is increasingly being globally acknowledged as a key precursor to atmospheric particulate matter. The European Directive 2001 / 81 /EC on “National Emission Ceilings for Certain Atmospheric Pollutants (NEC) ” regulates ammonia emissions in the member states. However, due to the chemical characteristics of ambient ammonia traceable on-line measurements still have significant challenges in analytical technology, uncertainty, quality assurance and quality control (QC/QA).

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarA field intercomparison with {{automatic}} <b>ammonia</b> <b>monitors</b> {{was held in}} Bilthoven, the Netherlands, {{for a period of}} two weeks. Six instruments were continuously and simultaneously operated to measure the ammonia concentration in ambient air. During the intercomparison these instruments were studied with respect to their performance and potential suitability as a monitor for the National Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN) of the Netherlands. The instruments were a continuous-flow denuder, developed by ECN, two thermodenuders, one developed by KEMA and the other by ECN, a commercial DOAS system of OPSIS, a photoacoustic monitor, developed by KEMA, and a (non-automatic) Annular Denuder System, used as a reference. With the latter method ammonium concentrations were also measured. The continuous-flow denuder proved to be a good instrument for accurate and fast measurement of ammonia concentrations, but needs frequent maintenance and calibration. Proper operating of the photoacoustic monitor was impaired by problems with the stability of the CO 2 laser. The performance of this monitor could not be well studied due to frequent readjustment of the laser. The detection limit of the DOAS system was high, i. e. 4 mug m- 3 based on a 3 -min averaging time and 0. 9 mug. m- 3 based on a 60 -min averaging time, whereas 0. 5 mug m- 3 is required.

IASI observations suggest that current ammonia emissions are underestimated in California and in the springtime in the Midwest. In California this underestimate likely drives the underestimate in nitrate formation in the GEOS-Chem model. However in the remaining continental United States {{we find that the}} nitrate simulation is biased high (normalized mean bias > = 1. 0) year-round, except in Spring (due to the underestimate in ammonia in this season). None of the uncertainties in precursor emissions, the uptake efficiency of N 2 O 5 on aerosols, OH concentrations, the reaction rate for the formation of nitric acid, or the dry deposition velocity of nitric acid are able to explain this bias. We find that reducing nitric acid concentrations to 75 % of their simulated values corrects the bias in nitrate (as well as ammonium) in the US. However the mechanism for this potential reduction is unclear and may be a combination of errors in chemistry, deposition and sub-grid near-surface gradients. This "updated" simulation reproduces PM and ammonia loading and captures the strong seasonal and spatial gradients in gas-particle partitioning across the United States. We estimate that nitrogen makes up 15 − 35 % of inorganic fine PM mass over the US, and that this fraction is likely to increase in the coming decade, both with decreases in sulfur emissions and increases in ammonia emissions...|$|R
40|$|Numerous passive {{samplers}} {{based on}} the ‘Palmes-tube’ {{have been developed for}} ambient air monitoring. In each case, the diffusion path length and/or crosssectional area are modified to achieve the desired sampling rate. ‘Tube-type’ samplers are low sensitivity samplers suitable for long-term monitoring, whereas the ‘badge-type’ samplers have faster sampling rates suited to short-term monitoring. In the U. K., diffusion tubes are widely used for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ammonia (NH 3). The open-ended diffusion tubes are prone to positive bias caused by incursion of wind eddies, leading to a shortening of the diffusion path. By using a porous membrane at the inlet, wind incursion is prevented, but an additional diffusion resistance is imposed and it is necessary to calibrate the tubes against a reference method to obtain an effective sampling rate. For NO 2 sampling, positive bias also arises from the reaction of NO with O 3 within the sampler. The interference from the chemical reaction is severe close to NO sources, with errors up to 30 % for curbside locations when using the ‘tubetype’ sampler. In rural areas, where NO concentrations are small relative to NO 2, these errors are small. In some implementations, there is also a negative bias over long sampling periods caused by the degradation of trapped NO 2. The low sampling rates of diffusion tubes make them too uncertain for use at background NH 3 concentrations (< 1 μg NH 3 m- 3) where they significantly overestimate concentrations. Badge-type samplers such as the ‘Willems badge’ samplers permit accurate sampling at low ambient NH 3 concentrations, but suffer from saturation at high concentrations and sensitivity to wind speed. A passive sampler optimised for monthly measurements of NH 3 is reported here, together with its application in the U. K. National <b>Ammonia</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Network...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{and state}} {{regulations}} are being promulgated under the Clean Air Act to reduce hazardous air emissions from livestock operations. Few {{data are available}} on emissions from livestock facilities in the USA and the management practices that may minimize emissions. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure seasonal and bedding impacts on ammonia emissions from tiestall dairy barns located in central Wisconsin. Four chambers each housed four Holstein dairy heifers (~ 17 mo of age; body weights, 427 – 522 kg) for three 28 -d trial periods corresponding to winter, summer, and fall. A 4 × 4 Latin Square statistical design was used to evaluate four bedding types (manure solids, chopped newspaper, pine shavings, and chopped wheat straw) in each chamber for a 4 -d <b>ammonia</b> <b>monitoring</b> period. Average ammonia-N emissions (g heifer − 1 d − 1) during summer (20. 4) and fall (21. 0) were similar and twice the emissions recorded during winter (10. 1). Ammonia-N emissions accounted for approximately 4 to 7 % of consumed feed N, 4 to 10 % of excreted N, and 9 to 20 % of manure ammonical N. Cooler nighttime temperatures did not result in lower ammonia emissions than daytime temperatures. Ammonia emissions (g heifer − 1 d − 1) from chambers that contained manure solids (20. 0), newspaper (18. 9), and straw (18. 9) were similar and significantly greater than emissions using pine shavings (15. 2). Chamber N balances, or percent difference between the inputs feed N and bedding N, and the outputs manure N, body weight N, and ammonia N were 105, 90, and 89 % for the winter, summer, and fall trials, respectively. Relatively high chamber N balances and favorable comparisons of study data with published values of ammonia emissions, feed N intake, and manure N excretion provided confidence in the accuracy of the study results...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia gases {{have their}} own {{advantages}} and disadvantages; however {{it is important to}} monitar ammonia emission to avoid hazardous level. Ultraviolet or broadband Infrared absorption, and Photothermal Deflection prevent the speciesconversion, time delay, and adsorption problems associated with traditional sampling systems, but often use expensive, bulky or delicate radiation sources that are not suitable for commercialisation. In gas detection, cross sensitivity is one of the constraints since the air consists of a variety of gases. A few techniques were introduced such as using gas separation techniques or ratio calculation to overcome the problem. For ammonia gas sensing, {{it has been reported that}} the cross sensitivity with humidity is the main problem and this occurs in certain wavelength ranges. This is a strong indication that cross sensitivity for <b>ammonia</b> emission <b>monitoring</b> must be modelled. Choosing suitable wavelength of ammonia with minimal cross sensitivity effect can reduce the effect of cross sensitivity at infrared region. In this numerical prediction analysis, the <b>optical</b> transmission of <b>ammonia</b> was obtained through a model developed using a commercial simulator SpectralCalc-GATS, OptiSystem and Matlab. The developed model is then interfaced with the integrated sensor system model using OptiSystem for system performance and characterisation. The simulation shows that ammonia absorption cross section within 2200 nm to 2400 nm region has less cross sensitivity issues. It is not possible to discuss the cross sensitivity issue for every single atmospheric gas as there are too many gases in the atmosphere and the amount is small and subject to the surrounding environment. These simulations consider other gases such as CO 2 and H 2 O Proper cross sensitivity is able to be simulated and characterised through the sensor model developed through this research...|$|R
