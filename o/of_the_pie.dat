5|$|As of 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format books {{remain in}} print, and {{available}} as complete sets in presentation boxes, {{and as a}} 400-page omnibus. First edition copies and early reprints <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pie</b> are offered by antiquarian booksellers. The Pie was available as a hardcover volume but also in paperback, audiobook, and electronic formats.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E

It is basically a remake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular video game Pac-Man except the player controls Wee Bull trying to steal all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pies</b> belonging to Weebl, Bob, Hairy Lee and Chris the Ninja Pirate Mushroom. While doing so, the characters will continuously say one-liners such as [...] "Nooooo! Not <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> !! [...] ", and [...] "Why aren't I eating pies when I move?".|$|R

Later, over dinner with Ambrose, Adrian berates him for not calling after Trudy died, and Ambrose, taken aback, says the reason he did not call was because he felt guilty: Trudy was running an errand to get cough medicine for him when she was killed, and he blames himself. He breaks down crying, and Adrian, shocked, tells him it was not his fault, and embraces him.|$|R

25|$|The {{first is}} a direct phonetic {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PIE</b> text. It {{does not take into}} account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period. For example, the original text uses the imperfect tense, which disappeared in Proto-Germanic. The second version takes these differences into account, and is therefore closer to the language the Germanic people would have actually spoken.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, California {{plummeted}} from {{fifth in}} the country to 40th in school spending. Classified employees, who had finally gotten a piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> through collective bargaining, found that there just wasn’t much to go around. Many school programs such as music, art and athletics simply vanished, and classified employees who worked in those programs lost their jobs or were shuffled around. By the late 1980s, schools, parents and even some of the voters who passed Prop.13, were tired of the funding shortfalls.|$|E
25|$|While Tocharian is {{generally}} regarded as a centum language, it is a special case, as it has merged all three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PIE</b> dorsal series (originally nine separate consonants) into a single phoneme, *k. According to some scholars, that complicates the classification of Tocharian within the centum–satem model. However, as Tocharian has replaced some Proto-Indo-European labiovelars with the labiovelar-like, non-original sequence *ku; it has been proposed that labiovelars remained distinct in Proto-Tocharian, which places Tocharian in the centum group (assuming that Proto-Tocharian lost palatovelars while labiovelars were still phonemically distinct).|$|E
50|$|At a {{traditional}} pie supper, {{women and girls}} would provide homemade pies to be auctioned, sometimes in boxes decorated with ruffles or bows. Along with <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> itself, <b>the</b> highest bidder won <b>the</b> privilege <b>of</b> sharing <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> with its maker, whose identity was concealed or known only {{to a handful of}} people. This added an element <b>of</b> suspense to <b>the</b> bidding, and <b>pie</b> suppers had strong courtship elements, as boys vied to win <b>the</b> <b>pies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girls they favored.|$|R

25|$|There is {{significant}} controversy with the PIE and BICEPS principles. Throughout {{a number of}} wars, but notably during the Vietnam War, {{there has been a}} conflict among doctors about sending distressed soldiers back to combat. During the Vietnam War this reached a peak with much discussion about the ethics of this process. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PIE</b> and BICEPS principles argue that it leads to a reduction of long-term disability but opponents argue that combat stress reactions lead to long-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The use of psychiatric drugs to treat victims of CSR has also attracted criticism, as some military psychiatrists have come to question the efficacy of such drugs on the long term health of veterans. Concerns have been expressed as to the effect of pharmaceutical treatment on an already elevated substance abuse rate among former CSR sufferers. Recent research has caused an increasing number of scientists to believe {{that there may be a}} physical (i.e., neurocerebral damage) rather than psychological basis for blast trauma. As traumatic brain injury and combat stress reaction have very different causes yet result in similar neurologic symptoms, researchers emphasize the need for greater diagnostic care.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 Marriott {{was back}} on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former Steppenwolf keyboardist Goldy McJohn and Chicago born drummer Fallon Williams III. This {{grouping}} was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie but ended up being billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed mostly as Small Faces to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at US Immigration and was deported back to England. Marriott based himself in the Atlanta, Georgia area, since that was where his second wife, Pamela Stephens, was from, and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from The Brains) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. And after a hoped for deal with Capricorn Records in nearby Macon fell through after that label's second collapse, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee to record three songs for a projected album, but nothing further came from it. After Johnson missed a show, he was replaced by Phil Dix. The band was then scheduled to record demos with Yes/ELP producer Eddy Offord at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards (also from The Brains and soon to find fame with the Georgia Satellites) as the new guitarist. But when Rick and Keith missed rehearsals, Steve was so mad that he not only fired Rick but Keith as well. The recordings were done with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (ex-Babe Ruth) on bass. But when these demos failed to attract another record deal and Pamela left Steve for another man, Steve disbanded this version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pie</b> and departed the US to return to England in late 1983.|$|E
500|$|The Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pie</b> and the Patty-Pan (originally, The Pie and the Patty-Pan) is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. [...] It tells of a cat called Ribby and a tea party she holds for a dog called Duchess. Complications arise when Duchess tries to replace Ribby's mouse pie with her own veal and ham pie, and then believes she has swallowed a small tin pastry form called a patty-pan. Its themes are etiquette and social relations in a small town.|$|E

50|$|Blueberry pie is a {{pie with}} a {{blueberry}} filling. Blueberry pie {{is considered one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> easiest <b>pies</b> to make {{because it does not}} require pitting or peeling of fruit. It usually has a top and bottom crust. The top crust can be a circular crust but <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> can also have a crumble crust or no top crust at all. Blueberry pies are often eaten in the summertime because that is when blueberries are in season.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies alternating-offer {{bargaining}} {{with players}} who have history-dependent reciprocity preferences. To allow for reciprocal motiva¬tion, the existing history-dependent models are modified by reversing the way aspirations depend on previous offers. The model exhibits a unique equilibrium where an agreement is reached immediately. As the players' discount factors approach unity, players share <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> according to <b>the</b> golden division: <b>the</b> responder's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>pie</b> coincides with <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposer's and the responder's shares. Thus, there is a first-mover disadvantage. ...|$|R
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it looks a bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pie</b> and the Patty-Pan.|$|E
500|$|Duchess is {{left alone}} before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal {{pie in the}} oven. [...] "Then I must have been eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill," [...] she muses. Knowing she cannot {{adequately}} explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie. [...] Ribby later finds the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> dish and the patty-pan outside the back door and declares, [...] "Well I never did! ... Next time I want to give a party – I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!" ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is still looking at the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered the state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry about the little dog's nose. I saw it was too sharp. I think I have got it right. I was intending to explain the ovens by saying the middle handle is very stiff so that Duchess concludes it is a sham;–like the lowest. I think only two pages want changing; I think it will come right." ...|$|E

500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pie</b> is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside this {{redistribution}} of wealth was the goal of increased economic growth. This economic growth would allow the non-Bumiputra share of the economy to decrease, while permitting the growth of non-Bumiputra business interests in absolute terms. In some quarters, this {{was referred to as}} [...] "expanding pie theory": the Bumiputra share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> would increase, without reducing the size of the non-Bumiputra slices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie.</b> This theory was first enunciated in the Second Malaysia Plan.|$|E
2500|$|The writing {{style in}} The Sweetness at the Bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pie</b> has been {{described}} as reminiscent of the [...] "Golden Age of crime writing," [...] influenced by the author's appreciation for the work of Dorothy L. Sayers, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ngaio Marsh, Agatha Christie, G. K. Chesterton, W. J. Burley, and Josephine Tey. Reviewer Lucy Clark compared Bradley's style to that of Agatha Christie, calling The Sweetness at the Bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pie</b> a [...] "delightfully old-fashioned mystery." [...] Kirkus Reviews compared the book's [...] "intellectual asides" [...] to that of Jonathan Gash.|$|E

Nouns and adjectives are declined in three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter); three numbers (singular, dual, plural); and five cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, dative and genitive).

40|$|We model a {{situation}} in which two players bargain over two pies, one of which can only be consumed starting at a future date. Suppose the players value <b>the</b> <b>pies</b> asymmetrically: one player values <b>the</b> existing <b>pie</b> more than <b>the</b> future one, while the other player has the opposite valuation. We show that players may consume only a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>pie</b> in <b>the</b> first period, and then consume <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> it, along with <b>the</b> second <b>pie,</b> at <b>the</b> date at which <b>the</b> second <b>pie</b> becomes available. Thus, our model features a special form of bargaining delay, in which agreements take place in multiple stages. Such partial agreements arise when players are patient enough, when they expect <b>the</b> second <b>pie</b> to become available soon, and when the asymmetry in their valuations is large enough...|$|R
