He gained his research experience entirely at Cambridge, working with Dewar and Fenton. With the latter he carried out his first experimental investigation on the [...] "oxidation of organic acids {{in the presence of}} iron" [...] (1900), and in 1904 prepared his own work on the stereochemistry of nitrogen. In 1907 and in 1909 he wrote the section on stereochemistry for the annual reports of the Chemical Society. The study of organic nitrogen bases led to his attempt to solve the difficult problem of the constitution and transformations of the aldol bases derived from the homologues of aniline. Meanwhile, Jones was assisting Dewar in very different investigations of the metallic (nickel and iron) carbonyls. These researches had made Jones familiar with low temperature manipulations and ultimately led to their discovery of carbon monosulfide. In this way Jones' attention was directed to <b>organic</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds, particularly thio-oxalates, thiomalonates and thiophosphates.

Ultrasonic extracts were analyzed by GC equipped with SPB- 1 Sulphur column and flame ionisation detector. Microwave assisted extraction was used to extract various forms of sulphur in coal. During sequential extraction, sulphate and pyrite sulphur were extracted from coal samples using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid respectively. Total organic or total sulphur and selected metals in coal were extracted by means of a mixture of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and boric acid. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy allowed the analysis of all total and other inorganic sulphur forms as well as selected metals from Microwave assisted extraction system after calibration set with standards.

They were accumulated in small limnic basins representing excellent geological archives for studying environmental changes. This contribution provides a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the individual mixtures of different organic matter types by organic-geochemical bulk parameters and molecular pyrolysate compositions. In total, more than 170 rock samples were studied along a 35 m section from the Göynük, and a 13 m section from the Seyitömer area, respectively. Compositional variations of the sediment input were assigned macro- and micro-petrographically and by measurement of the carbonate content. Kerogens were characterised by elemental analyses of total <b>organic</b> carbon, total <b>sulphur</b> and hydrogen indices. Then, 29 selected rock samples were investigated in detail by temperature programmed open-system pyrolysis-gas chromatography. The two sections investigated show extreme variations of <b>organic</b> carbon, <b>sulphur</b> and hydrocarbons. <b>Organic</b> carbon contens of 1. 5 - 66. 6 % (Göynük) and 0. 6 - 58. 6 % (Seyitömer) and hydrogen indices ranging from 63 - 941 mg HC/g TOC (Göynük) and 14 - 987 mg HC/g TOC (Seyitömer) point to differences in compositions of organic matter. According to variations of the hydrogen index versus organic carbon content, all sedimentary rocks can easily be differentiated in organic rich shales or limestones, oil shales, humic coals and sapropelic coals. The relative molecular abundances of the individual pyrolytic degradation products from temperature programmed pyrolysis-gas chromatography follows the classification of the relative amounts of sapropelic versus humic organic matter. Indvidual compound classes (aromatic hydrocarbons, n-C$_{ 6 - 32 }$ alkanes+alkenes and C$_{ 6 - 32 }$ unidentified resolved compounds normalized to 100 %) indicate marked differences of the organic matter composition, especially from ratios of alkanes+alkenes to aromatic compounds.

The results of organic geochemical analyses of core samples obtained from the Karabogaz Formation suggest that phosphate deposition occurred in settings where the water column was oxic to sub-oxic. However, the preservation of organic matter was favoured in anoxic environments. Moreover, the presence of sulphur (especially sulphur incorporated into kerogen) in organic matter-rich layers led to early oil generation. The results of stepwise py-gc analyses are consistent with a model in which, with increasing maturity, S-S and C-S bonds are the first to be eliminated from the macromolecular kerogen structure. Study of the maturity evolution of S-rich kerogen by laboratory pyrolysis implies that marginally mature and/or mature kerogen in the Karabogaz Formation, which may be classified as classic “Type II” kerogen, was most probably Type II/S at lower maturity stages. This enabled oil generation to occur at relatively shallow burial depths and relatively early stages of maturation. It is reasonable to conclude that Type II/S kerogen, overlooked in previous studies, was abundant in TOC-rich intervals in the Karabogaz Formation. Early generation (and expulsion) from Type II/S kerogen may have sourced the sulphur-rich oils in the Adiyaman area oilfields...|$|R

The emission of volatiles with the sulphur atom was detected only for moulds growing on materials which contained the proteins with cysteine in the polypeptide chain. These were the esters of sulfuric acids with long-chain alcohols. In the case of two species which grew on the cellulosic samples no emission of sulphur containing compounds was detected. In this case, the media and both types of paper did not contained <b>organic</b> compounds with <b>sulphur</b> atom.|$|R
40|$|Powdery mildew {{caused by}} Leveillula taurica (Lev.) Arn. {{is one of}} the most serious foliar {{diseases}} of greenhouse and open field tomato. The disease is currently controlled with the use of <b>organic</b> fungicides and <b>sulphur,</b> the latter being the only product permitted in organic crops. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of controlling the disease by integrating: a) hybrids of low susceptibility to the disease, b) organic fertilisers (chitin) and c) alternative spray treatments. Some of the combinations of the above factors were highly effective in decreasing the percentage of disease severity. Specifically the combination of the hybrid of low susceptibility with the addition of chitin in the substrate and the spray treatment Milsana®+chitosan, was equally effective to sulphur. These results indicate that the combination of the above factors could probably be used as an alternative to sulphur for control of L. taurica in the greenhouse...|$|R
