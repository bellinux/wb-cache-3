40|$|Meiosis creates haploid {{cells from}} diploid progenitors. Homologous {{chromosomes}} are moved, paired and segregated {{from each other}} in a specialized meiosis I division. A second division that lacks a preceding S-phase produces haploid cells. In prophase I, chromosomes attach with their telomeres to the nuclear envelope and undergo <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> that become restricted to a limited nuclear sector during the widely conserved bouquet stage. Recent observations in budding yeast meiosis suggest that telomere clustering depends on actin, whereas exit from the bouquet stage requires meiotic cohesin. Telomere clustering may also be modulated by progression in recombination. These observations suggest that the unique meiotic nuclear topology and telomere dynamics are regulated at different levels...|$|R
50|$|For polar {{components}} orientated {{such that}} they are parallel to the electric field the resulting <b>oscillating</b> <b>movement</b> will be entirely in-phase with the modulated electric field but for an anti-parallel alignment the motion will be 180° out-of-phase. In this way {{it is possible to}} determine the orientation of the vertical components of polarisation from analysis of the phase information, φ, contained in the input signal, readily available after demodulation in the LiA, when using the VPFM mode. In a similar sense the orientations of in-plane polar components can also be determined from the phase difference when using the LPFM mode. The amplitude of the piezoresponse of either VPFM or LPFM is also given by the LiA, {{in the form of the}} magnitude, R.|$|E
50|$|Each {{structure}} has natural frequencies. For resonance to occur, {{it is necessary}} to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called vortex shedding. This is because bluff bodies (non-streamlined bodies), like bridge decks, in a fluid stream shed wakes, whose characteristics depend on {{the size and shape of}} the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body (the so-called Von Kármán vortex street). The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an <b>oscillating</b> <b>movement</b> called vortex-induced vibration. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure's movement can become self-sustaining.|$|E

In certain circumstances, twisted wire can be used to give the arc an <b>oscillating</b> <b>movement.</b> This helps fuse the toe of the weld to the base metal.The electrode composition depends upon the material being welded. Alloying elements may be added in the electrodes. Electrodes are available to weld mild steels, high carbon steels, low and special alloy steels, stainless steel and some of the nonferrous of copper and nickel. Electrodes are generally copper coated to prevent rusting and to increase their electrical conductivity. Electrodes are available in straight lengths and coils. Their diameters may be 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.4 mm. The approximate value of currents to weld with 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 mm diameter electrodes are 150-350, 250-800 and 650-1350 Amps respectively.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new concept}} for the {{calculation}} of mixed lubrication is presented. Using the finiteelemente- method (FEM), the load and friction forces are calculated separately for lubricant and solid. Thereby, the fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) between lubricant pressure and solid deformation is taken into account. The finite-elemente model is based on real 3 D surface roughness measurements using a stylus profilometer. The surface profiles are discretized into rectangular poles. In order to solve the FSI problem, the flow calculation is interlinked with the structural calculation. For the oil-lubricated tribological system linear thrust bearing (material: G-CuZn 15 Si 4) and steel counterpart (material: Ck 45), the calculations are verified for static load, slow <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> and different bearing temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Some {{species have}} cryptic adaptations {{by which they}} use leaves in {{avoiding}} predators. For example, the caterpillars of some leaf-roller moths will create a small home in the leaf by folding it over themselves. Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes. Females of the Attelabidae, so-called leaf-rolling weevils, lay their eggs into leaves that they then roll up as means of protection. Other herbivores and their predators mimic {{the appearance of the}} leaf. Reptiles such as some chameleons, and insects such as some katydids, also mimic the <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> of leaves in the wind, moving from side to side or back and forth while evading a possible threat.|$|R

From the mobility of animals, Cuvier, with his characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning, deduces the necessity of the existence in them of an alimentary cavity, or reservoir of food, whence their nutrition may be drawn by the vessels, which are a sort of internal roots; and, {{in the presence of}} this alimentary cavity, he naturally sees the primary and the most important distinction between animals and plants.|$|R
50|$|As an alternative, an <b>oscillating</b> <b>movement</b> of {{the entire}} sensor head can be carried out, this is, however, only {{considered}} a special application of a one-dimensionally measuring system. An advantage of the laser scanner is that, with according processing speed, the lighting conditions can be adapted for every single point-shaped distance measurement which results in illumination uniformity. Moreover, due to the point-shaped illumination, the laser point is through the concentrated laser power and also through appropriate optical filters, compared with the interfering arc radiation, easier to detect by the detection element.The light-section sensor avoids the disadvantage of moving parts in the sensor head (Figure 6). Here, the surface is not scanned pointwise, the entire geometry is, moreover, captured in one image. For this purpose, the point-shaped laser beam is expanded via an optics to a line which is projected {{onto the surface of}} the workpiece transverse to the groove in accordance with the scan line of the scanner. The laser line is, in accordance with the same geometrical principle of triangulation, again acquired with a detector element, this time, however, two-dimensionally. For the acquisition, CCD and CMOS cameras with the above-mentioned properties can be used.|$|E

The exciting force of this dynamic system actuates between the carrying element and the inertial mass. The inertial mass is fixed to the ground by an elastic constraint using a relatively stiff rubber spring. This elastic constraint ensures the conveyor’s stability and defines its position towards the assembly line, but does not meet relevant effective vibration isolation demands.

Different associations of platform conodont form genera (Biofacies) reflect different ecological conditions, which are directly or indirectly related to water depth, turbulency, salinity and proximity to the coast; from offshore to backshore we recognized successively a Palmatolepid, a Palmatolepid-Polygnathid, a Polygnathid-Icriodid, an Icriodid, and a supposed Clydagnathid biofacies. In this way the distribution pattern of conodont biofacies throughout the Famennian, represents a normal response to the <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> of a prograding "coast" in the studied sedimentary basins. The presence moreover of mixed conodont biofacies (or thanatocoenoses) is also related to sedimentological processes, such as storm wave action, turbidity currents and tidal inlets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Stock {{markets have}} been of great {{interest}} to investors and academicians due to the uncertainty and expected pecuniary profits attached to them. For a few years, the Indian capital market has seen high volatility and market crashes. Market crashes are often preceded by speculative bubbles with two main characteristics: (a) power law acceleration of the market price, and (b) log-periodic oscillations. This paper attempts to investigate whether the Indian stock market follows log-periodicity. Here log-periodicity refers {{to the fact that the}} oscillations are periodic in the logarithm of the time-to-crash. Speculative bubbles of financial markets show similarities in the way they evolve and grow. This particular <b>oscillating</b> <b>movement</b> can be captured by the log-periodic power law. If market follows log-periodicity, a crash may be predicted. The analysis shows that log-periodic oscillations are present in the Indian stock market...|$|E

40|$|When a {{containerized}} seedling is pneumatically transported through a pipe or hose it occasionally undergoes <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements,</b> {{referred to as}} “wobbling“, with the container being flung {{from one side of}} the hose to the other. Data on this phenomenon obtained in a previous feed-time study were further analyzed. In addition, a laboratory study was carried out in which the behaviours of seedling-container dummies of different sizes and shapes were studied at different air velocities in Plexiglas pipes of various diameters. Both the analy-ses of the frequencies of wobbling from the previous feed-time study and the results from the laboratory test confirmed that there is covariation between the wobbling tendency of a seedling and the shape of its container. Containers with a large butt-end area tend to wobble more. This leads to differentiation of the seedlings into two groups, seedlings with butt-ended and less butt-ended containers.

40|$|Typical damage {{modes of}} rotor blade {{bearings}} are mainly related to <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> with small angles under high loads. Under these conditions, the lubrication film between rollers and raceways of the bearings tends to collapse, which causes metal to metal contact and surface induced damage. Since established calculation methods for lifetime prediction are unsuitable for wind turbine blade bearings, full-scale test rigs are developed to close this particular knowledge gap. To generate realistic boundary conditions for bearing tests, the stiffness of the interfaces such as blade and hub {{have to be}} investigated. Because of the disadvantages of using real components within these test rigs, a possible solution is to use substitute components which aim to emulate the interface behaviour of the real components. This paper presents a method to derive a substitute of a rotor hub based on a FE-model of the virtual IWT 7. 5 - 164 research turbine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Muscle {{ultrasound}} {{is capable}} of visualizing muscle movements. Recent improvements in ultrasound technology have raised the question whether {{it is also possible}} to detect small-scale spontaneous muscle activity such as denervation. In this study we investigated the ability of dynamic muscle ultrasound to detect fibrillations. METHODS: Eight patients with fibrillations were measured simultaneously by ultrasound and EMG to verify which movements on ultrasound examination corresponded to fibrillation potentials on EMG. The temperature dependency of ultrasound detected fibrillations and the observer agreement was assessed in five healthy subjects with focal denervation induced by botulinum toxin. RESULTS: Fibrillations appeared on ultrasound examination as small, irregularly <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> within the muscle while the overall shape of the muscle remains undisturbed. Visibility of fibrillations with ultrasound decreased with lower temperatures, with a 32 % decrease at 30 degrees C compared to 39 degrees C. The interobserver agreement was substantial with a kappa of 0. 65 for experienced observers. CONCLUSION: Fibrillations could be visualized with ultrasound. Consistent results could be obtained from trained observers. Care has to be taken to ensure an optimal muscle temperature to avoid false negative results, especially in distal muscles. SIGNIFICANCE: Visualization of fibrillations by muscle ultrasound opens the way for a new diagnostic application of this technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{wind tunnel}} study {{examines}} aeolian sediment transport in live plant canopies, whereas most previous studies have used model plants for this purpose. Experiments were performed with three canopy densities of Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and with bare sand surfaces. The results suggest that both total sediment mass flux Q and PM 10 concentration in the air decreased exponentially with increasing canopy density. In the large-density canopy (frontal area index ¿ = 0. 58), Q and PM 10 concentration were reduced to 0. 01 % and 0. 4 %, respectively, compared to the unplanted configuration. In the medium-density canopy (¿ = 0. 16), Q and PM 10 concentration were reduced to 6. 6 % and 48. 5 %. In the small-density canopy (¿ = 0. 03), however, Q and PM 10 concentration were increased to 117. 5 % and 145. 6 %. This is attributed to elevated shear stress on the sand bed caused by flow acceleration around the tussocks and vortical structures in their lee. Furthermore, the grasses were observed to trigger erosion by <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> at the ground surface.

40|$|The pitch bearing, which {{connects the}} hub and the blades, allows the {{required}} <b>oscillating</b> <b>movements</b> of the blade, {{to change the}} angle of attack thus reducing the lift and drag coefficients there by controlling power and loads of the wind turbine. During the service life of the turbine of approximately 20 years the pitch bearing is loaded dynamically. In a double row four-point contact ball bearing, which is often used for this application, the described loads lead to radial and axial displacements between {{the inner and outer}} ring and deformations. These displacements and deformations lead to contact angles which vary from the mounted contact angle which is given by the supplier of the bearing. These divergent angles are called free contact angles. For a four-point contact ball bearing the mounted contact angle in the presented example is 45 °. Deviations from the mounted contact angle can lead to reduced fatigue life of the bearing and increased wear, arising from the modified contact behavior. Under axial loads and bending moments the contact area shifts perpendicular to the rolling direction. In the worst case the contact area is truncated, which leads to concentrated and comparatively high stresses. This paper shows how the free contact angles of a double row four-point contact ball bearing of a modern wind turbine with 7. 5 MW behaves during the service life and the effects of contact angle variations to the stress distribution. For the analysis a FE-Model of the bearing which includes the stiffness of the bearing and adjacent components is used...|$|R
