5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E
5|$|When the Palestinian National Council (PNC) {{convened in}} Cairo on 3 February 1969, Yahya Hammuda {{stepped down from}} his {{chairmanship}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Arafat was elected chairman on 4 February. He became Commander-in-Chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, {{he served}} as <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> political department. After the Oslo accords in 1993, which he opposed as a betrayal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> principles, he refused {{to move to the}} Palestinian territories with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leadership to set up the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). From exile, he continued to advocate a hardline stance towards Israel, refused cooperation with the PNA and repeatedly embarrassed <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> during negotiations with Israel by making statements denying the Jewish state's right to exist. This led to him being sidelined in Palestinian politics for over a decade, as <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> power moved to Gaza and then Ramallah.|$|R
2500|$|The fifth {{national}} council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palestine Liberation Organisation in February 1969 {{passed a resolution}} confirming that <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> objective was [...] "to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews". <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> was not successful in building support for the binational solution within Israeli society, however, which {{lay the groundwork for}} an eventual re-scoping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> aim toward partition into two states.|$|R
50|$|Although many in <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> opposed <b>the</b> Oslo Agreements, the Executive Committee and the Central Council {{approved}} the Accords. It marked <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> decline, as <b>the</b> PA came to replace <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> as <b>the</b> prime Palestinian political institution. Political factions within <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> that had opposed the Oslo process were marginalized. Only during the Hamas-led PA Government in 2006-2007, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> resurfaced. After Hamas {{had taken over}} Gaza in 2007, Abbas issued a decree suspending the PLC and some sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian Basic Law, and appointing Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister.|$|R
25|$|While Saad {{was one of}} the staunchest Lebanese {{supporters}} of the Palestinian cause, he was also a critic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> guerrillas' increasingly defiant attempts to gain control over Sidon, where Saad was traditionally dominant. In 1969 he was sharply criticized by the as-Saiqa, a Syrian-backed faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> for not agreeing to support their fighters during a shootout with the Lebanese Army.|$|E
25|$|Mahmoud Abbas, leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> {{published}} a Ph.D. thesis (at Moscow University) in 1982, called The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} his resignation as leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> on 22 August 2015. As of December 2015, {{he was still}} acting as Chairman, pending approval by the Palestinian National Council.|$|E
50|$|From 2003 to 2012, {{he served}} as deputy Minister for Prisoners’ Affairs in the Palestinian Authority. In September 2014, he became head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> Commission Against <b>the</b> Separation Wall and Settlements, {{responsible}} for monitoring Israeli activities concerning the separation barrier and construction in settlements in the West Bank and peaceful “popular resistance” activities <b>of</b> Palestinians against <b>the</b> security barrier and settlements as well.|$|R
50|$|As head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> {{political}} department, Kaddoumi has {{primary responsibility}} for foreign representation, however, PLO embassies were reorganized by Abbas and PNA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad by removing Kaddoumi loyalists as ambassadors in PLO representations worldwide. Abbas has redirected foreign contacts to pass through <b>the</b> PNA's Minister <b>of</b> Foreign Affairs Nasser Al-Qidwa, and later Ziad Abu Amr and Riad Al-Maliki, which has infuriated Kaddoumi.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> Palestinian Declaration <b>of</b> Independence <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> {{representation}} {{was renamed}} Palestine. On 7 July 1998, this status {{was extended to}} allow participation in General Assembly debates, though not in voting.|$|R
25|$|With the {{withdrawal}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> leadership from Tripoli in December 1983 {{there was an}} Egyptian-PLO rapprochement, this {{was found to be}} encouraging by the Reagan administration but was condemned by the Israeli government.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> in Jordan, many Palestinian militants {{relocated}} to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases {{also led to}} increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} removed PLO presence from Southern Lebanon and the Syrian {{military was}} weakened by combat losses, {{especially in the}} air. However, the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> also {{paved the way for}} the rise of other militant groups, particularly Hezbollah.|$|E

50|$|Al-Hassan called {{election}} of a Palestinian provisional government capable <b>of</b> ending <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> isolation after <b>the</b> First Intifada in 1991. He settled in Rabat, Morocco that year after being expelled, along {{with hundreds of thousands}} of other Palestinians, from Kuwait during the Gulf War, in which <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> aligned itself with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|The Egyptian {{government}} had given PLO officials in Tunisia 48 hours {{to take control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four hijackers by Egypt. Arafat had told the Egyptians that he needed time to find a nation that they could take the four for trial. If <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> couldn't find a cooperative nation, Egypt would release the men or turn them over to Italy. <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> did not feel anxious about <b>the</b> agreement, one <b>of</b> its officials saying [...] "Italy {{is a friend of}} ours, so it's no problem." [...] <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> also asserted that the four were not PLO members but only a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PLF. Some in the International community, such as the USA, held that this was a common tactic by Arafat. Holding that when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> constituent groups committed an act of violence, he would claim that the group was rebelling from PLO control and beyond his control or influence.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the foreign}} {{leaders who have}} visited the Khatyn Memorial during their time in office are Richard Nixon of the US, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rajiv Gandhi of India, Yasser Arafat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> and Jiang Zemin of China.|$|E
25|$|The ICIPP {{sought to}} promote private and {{unofficial}} dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians {{in as many}} ways as possible, but also {{to try to bring}} about official negotiations between the Government of Israel and the leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Israeli F-15s used heavily {{modified}} Boeing 707 {{aircraft to}} provide aerial refueling over the Mediterranean Sea {{in order to}} extend their range for the 2,000km flight during the Operation Wooden Leg air raid on the headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> near Tunis, Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|Between 1977 and 1994, Abed Rabbo {{served as}} <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Information Department. During the 1980s, Abed Rabbo became closely allied with PLO {{chairman}} Yasser Arafat and supported {{his attempts to}} negotiate a two-state solution. Arafat appointed him <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> representative in <b>the</b> 1988-1990 talks with the United States in Tunis. By then, relations between Abed Rabbo and Hawatmeh deteriorated. The two disagreed about Abed Rabbo's participation in Arafat's diplomacy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DFLP's political activities in Jordan, where Hawatmeh was based. Violent clashes between their supporters and Abed formed a separate faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DFLP in 1991, although he continued to use the DFLP's name. In 1991, {{he was a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madrid Peace Delegation.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 September 1992, David Mellor {{resigned}} as National Heritage Secretary. [...] Mellor had been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> intense press attention regarding his extra-marital affair with actress Antonia de Sancha. [...] Mellor remained {{in office for}} {{two months after the}} story broke, but was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had accepted a free holiday from <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> finance director. [...] Although Mellor's resignation antedated John Major's [...] "Back to Basics" [...] speech by more than a year, the media were quick to link the new campaign to the scandal.|$|R
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} the war started, Yasser Arafat visited the castle, sat down with its {{defenders}} and assured them that in thirty-six hours <b>of</b> fighting, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> could get a ceasefire. The sector commander protested, insisting {{that there was no}} way they could withstand an Israeli attack for so long.|$|R
25|$|In 1982 Italian {{forces were}} {{deployed}} to Lebanon (then racked by the Lebanese Civil War) together with American and French troops as the Multinational Force in Lebanon. The stated {{aim of the}} Multinational Force was to oversee the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> from Lebanon but the deployment lasted beyond that point.|$|E
25|$|Palestinian Cabinet member Saeb Erakat {{protested that}} {{the seizure of}} Abbas was in {{violation}} of the Oslo peace accords (signed by the US, Israel, the EU, Russia, Jordan, Egypt, Norway, and the Palestinian Authority) which agreed that no member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> would be arrested or brought to trial for actions previous to September 13, 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{demands of}} these populations were {{somewhat}} differing {{from those of}} the Palestinian diaspora, which had constituted the main base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> until then, in that they were primarily interested in independence, rather than refugee return. The resulting 1993 Oslo Agreement cemented the belief in a two-state solution in the mainstream Palestinian movement, as opposed to the PLO's original goal, a one-state solution which entailed the destruction of Israel and its replacement with a secular, democratic Palestinian state. The idea had first been seriously discussed in the 1970s, and gradually become the unofficial negotiating stance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> leadership under Arafat, but it had still remained a taboo subject for most, until Arafat officially recognized Israel in 1988, under strong pressure from the United States. However, the belief in the ultimate necessity of Israel's destruction and/or its Zionist foundation (i.e. its existence as specifically Jewish state) is still advocated by many, such as the religiously motivated Hamas movement, although no longer by the PLO leadership.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> operation, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest-level <b>PLO</b> leaders, {{surprised}} at home, were killed, {{along with other}} PLO members. Several Lebanese security people and civilian neighbors were also killed. Two Israeli soldiers were killed.|$|R
25|$|When Abbas {{had ordered}} the hijackers to return the ship to Port Said, and the ship's captain had radioed Egyptian port {{officials}} – the problem fell onto Egypt's President Mubarak. The Egyptian government had competing interests he was attempting to balance. Mubarak wanted to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, the 1978 Camp David Accords, but also keep good relations with its fellow Arab states in the Middle East. <b>The</b> Israeli bombing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Tunis headquarters <b>the</b> previous week had left many innocent Tunisians killed or wounded, adding to the pressures on Mubarak. He also wanted to maintain {{good relations with the}} USA to not jeopardize billions of dollars in foreign aid.|$|R
2500|$|For its part, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> {{used its}} new {{privileges}} {{to establish an}} effective [...] "mini-state" [...] in southern Lebanon, and to ramp up its attacks on settlements in northern Israel. [...] Compounding matters, Lebanon received an influx of armed Palestinian militants, including Arafat and his Fatah movement, fleeing the 1970 Jordanian crackdown. [...] <b>The</b> <b>PLO's</b> [...] "vicious terrorist attacks in Israel" [...] dating from this period were countered by Israeli bombing raids in southern Lebanon, where [...] "150 or more towns and villages...have been repeatedly savaged by the Israeli armed forces since 1968," [...] <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Khiyam is probably the best-known example. [...] Palestinian attacks claimed 106 lives in northern Israel from 1967, according to official IDF statistics, while the Lebanese army had recorded [...] "1.4 Israeli violations of Lebanese territory per day from 1968–74" [...] Where Lebanon had no conflict with Israel during the period 1949–1968, after 1968 Lebanon's southern border began to experience an escalating cycle of attack and retaliation, leading to <b>the</b> chaos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil war, foreign invasions and international intervention. [...] <b>The</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> arrival in Lebanon continue to this day.|$|R
25|$|From the {{perspective}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> Israel {{responded to the}} disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt for the lives and safety of Palestinians. For Palestinians, the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.|$|E
25|$|As-Sa'iqa {{is led by}} a Secretary-General, Farhan Abu Al-Hayja since 2007. It has a {{representative}} (Muhammad al-Khalifa) on the PLO Executive Committee, but he boycotts sessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> EC. During much of the 1970s, as-Sai'qa's representatives in the PLO EC (Muhsin and al-Qadi) held the prestigious and sensitive post as Head of the Military Department, which reflects the military importance of the movement in these years.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1988 and 1992, intra-Palestinian {{violence}} claimed <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> nearly 1,000.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{is available}} for download at [URL] Family Justice Review (Ministry of Justice, 2011) highlighted a number of concerns surrounding delays in care and supervision proceedings. As a result, the Government is seeking to introduce a statutory time limit for all care and supervision cases to be completed within 26 weeks wherever possible. The Public Law Outline (<b>PLO)</b> is <b>the</b> key guidance the judiciary use for managing public law cases. Revisions {{have been made to}} <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> to institute streamlined processes which will deliver speedier outcomes that better meet <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> children and lay the foundation for <b>the</b> planned introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time limit. <b>The</b> revised <b>PLO</b> places increased emphasis on local authority documentation and assessments being completed earlier during pre-proceedings in order to deliver evidence at <b>the</b> outset <b>of</b> a case. It also aims to ensure that the evidence local authorities provide for the court is focused, succinct and analytical. <b>The</b> revised <b>PLO</b> introduces reduced timeframes for key stages in court proceedings. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most significant changes is that the first key hearing, now the Case Management Hearing (CMH), should be held no later than Day 12. Here, detailed case management directions should be given to enable cases, where possible, to be completed within 26 weeks. <b>The</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revised <b>PLO</b> outlined in this report are accurate for the processes and documents in place during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revised <b>PLO,</b> between July 2013 and April 2014. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this research have been used to inform <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘final’ <b>PLO</b> (and associated documentation) that will support <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 26 -week time limit included in the Children and Families Act 2014.
