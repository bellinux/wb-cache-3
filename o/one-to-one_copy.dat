It {{is not possible to}} use a {{pointing machine}} to produce enlarged or reduced copies; the traditional instruments for this are a set of calipers or a three-dimensional version of the pantograph. However, there is also a special version of the pointing machine that was used for mirroring, enlargements or reduced carving.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a collection of}} event-by-event models that simulate fundamental optical experiments. The simulation approach is completely based on the experimental facts. Each component in the model corresponds to one kind of optical device, such as a beam splitter, a wave plate, a detector and so on. Networks of such components build computational experiments which are <b>one-to-one</b> <b>copies</b> of real experiments. As all components share the same mechanism (leaning machine) {{as in the previous}} work, our event-by-event simulation models are systematic and consistent with each other. As the model provides a description of interference and other wave phenomena on the level of individual event, it goes beyond the description of quantum theory. All the results presented in this thesis demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} simulate quantum phenomena by classical, non-Hamiltonian, local, causal and dynamical models. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{narrative}} team at Riot eventually {{decided this}} setup was too constraining, and [...] "rebooted" [...] {{the story behind}} League of Legends in 2014. [...] In essence, the original story put {{too much emphasis on}} the faceless player stand-in Summoners and the Time Mages of the Institute; [...] "the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers." [...] Any interesting champions the Narrative team created were rendered as secondary, mere servants to the Summoners, unable to influence their own destiny. Many champion's lore did not give them reason to join the Institute, such as serial killer fire spirit Brand or void monster Rek'Sai. Riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own, pursuing their own unique goals. For example, Riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the Shurima desert and a plotline about a clash between the pirate Gangplank and the pirate-hunter Miss Fortune in the city of Bilgewater, both of which were driven by the champions of League of Legends, not Summoners. Riot compared this style of narrative to comic book characters and classic literature, where interesting characters can have many adventures over time and not necessarily have all of them make sense in the same continuity. [...] A side effect of this is [...] "that the game and story aren’t <b>one-to-one</b> <b>copies</b> of each other." ...|$|R

We demonstrate that although the visibility can be used as a measure for the interference, it cannot be used to quantify the wave character of a photon. The classical particle-like simulation model renders the concept of wave-particle duality, used to explain the outcome of the quantum eraser experiment with photons, superfluous...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, it {{is argued}} that the {{linguistic}} properties and affinities between the so-called Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages cannot be represented in terms of a family tree model. This means that the hypothesized genetic relationship between these languages is not sufficiently argued for. The early scholars of Finno-Ugric language comparison worked with word lists to proof genetic relationships. This was unmotivated, however. But also the sound laws that have been elaborated in Indo-Germanic linguistics cannot be <b>copied</b> <b>one-to-one</b> into Uralic/Finno-Ugric linguistics. The sound laws are not without exceptions in Uralic/Finno-Ugric and cannot be documented {{due to the lack of}} old documents. The lexical basic stock of Finno-Ugric cannot be isolated. There are substantial parallels with the Altaic languages, especially with (Old) Turkic. The number of lexical items of the basic vocabulary is not constant in the literature. This means that there is no methodologically well-established system to track down the items of the basic vocabulary. The morphological and grammatical domains display a number of serious divergences showing that a genetic relationship between the Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages is not very likely. From this it follows that the general, common features that certainly exist among the Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages (see the Appendix) can be explained the safest as a case of language contact. Such a theory of Sprachbund will not be elaborated in this paper, however...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} an event-based computer simulation {{model of the}} Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments with photons. The algorithm is a <b>one-to-one</b> <b>copy</b> of the data gathering and analysis procedures used in real laboratory experiments. We consider two types of experiments, those with a source emitting photons with opposite but otherwise unpredictable polarization and those with a source emitting photons with fixed polarization. In the simulation, {{the choice of the}} direction of polarization measurement for each detection event is arbitrary. We use three different procedures to identify pairs of photons and compute the frequency of coincidences by analyzing experimental data and simulation data. The model strictly satisfies Einstein’s criteria of local causality, does not rely on any concept of quantum theory and reproduces the results of quantum theory for both types of experiments. We give a rigorous proof that the probabilistic description of the simulation model yields the quantum theoretical expressions for the single- and two-particle expectation values. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} an event-based corpuscular {{simulation model}} that reproduces the wave mechanical results of single-photon double slit and two-beam interference experiments and (of a <b>one-to-one</b> <b>copy</b> of an experimental realization) of a single-photon interference experiment with a Fresnel biprism. The simulation comprises models that capture the essential {{features of the}} apparatuses used in the experiment, including the single-photon detectors recording individual detector clicks. We demonstrate that incorporating in the detector model, simple and minimalistic processes mimicking the memory and threshold behavior of single-photon detectors is sufficient to produce multipath interference patterns. These multipath interference patterns are built up by individual particles taking one single path to the detector where they arrive one-by-one. The particles in our model are not corpuscular in the standard, classical physics sense {{in that they are}} information carriers that exchange information with the apparatuses of the experimental set-up. The interference pattern is the final, collective outcome of the information exchanges of many particles with these apparatuses. The interference patterns are produced without making reference to the solution of a wave equation and without introducing signalling or non-local interactions between the particles or between different detection points on the detector screen.
