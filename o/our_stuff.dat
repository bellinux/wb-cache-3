[...] However, the rehydration drink was first known as [...] "Cade's Ade" [...] and [...] "Cade's Cola" [...] to the Florida Gators football team, and only later {{became known as}} [...] "Gatorade." [...] The drink received its first real test in the Gators' 1965 game against the LSU Tigers football team; the Tigers faded in the [...] heat {{of the second half}} and the Gators did not. Coach Graves was convinced, and asked Cade to produce enough of his potion for all Gator games. Gatorade achieved national prominence {{as a result of the}} Gators' first Orange Bowl title over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in January 1967. The Gators reinforced their reputation as a [...] "second-half team" [...] and came from behind to defeat the Yellow Jackets 27–10. Afterward, Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Dodd told reporters: [...] "We didn't have Gatorade; that made the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put <b>our</b> <b>stuff</b> out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The 179th and 180th Brigades {{conducted}} steady advances {{until the}} leading troop were {{held up by}} fire, then building up to a strong firing line before launching an assault, while the field artillery lifted to the fortifications behind as the battalions captured the front trenches. A delay in the attack occurred, when the advancing infantry ran into uncut wire, and the 179th Brigade Stokes mortar barrage was called forward. [...] "This is where we do <b>our</b> <b>stuff.</b> I told the fellows to set the gun up, {{but what was the}} range. How to even guess in that murk?

2500|$|In July 2011, Minneapolis based {{record label}} Doomtree {{released}} {{an album of}} mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself {{did not have any}} involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated [...] "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of <b>our</b> <b>stuff,</b> do better work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis and Sanders first {{approached}} Larry Sherman of Trax - a {{label that}} had a capital {{role in the development}} of house music - in 1984 or 1985, as the genre was beginning to take off. As titles in his catalogue were beginning to chart and the duo were unknown in the club scene, Sherman shrugged their demos off. State Street Records were also uninterested. At that time, the duo started attending the Art Institute of Chicago, and began to produce new music in its sound room. When they came back to Sherman in 1988 with additional material, he agreed to put it out. Sanders and Lewis produced the album at Rax Trax, where they met Rick Barnes (who ran the studio) and Derek Brand, members of the Nicholas Tremulis Band. Although Lidell Townsell was enlisted to help the duo with production, they ended up doing it themselves. Regarding the recording, Sanders stated: [...] "Most of <b>our</b> <b>stuff</b> we played live except for the drum machine. Everything else we got so used to just playing, I guess just from the repetition, we didn't use a sequencer at all. We showed up at the studio, had our keyboards, hit [...] "Record." [...] It's kind of like a live session with the keyboards." [...] They recorded all the songs in one live session, quickly moving on from track to track.|$|E

5000|$|Research Unix 8th Edition {{started from}} (I think) BSD 4.1c, but with {{enormous}} amounts scooped out {{and replaced by}} <b>our</b> own <b>stuff.</b> This continued with 9th and 10th. The ordinary user command-set was, I guess, a bit more BSD-flavored than SysVish, but it was pretty eclectic.|$|R
2500|$|Speaking on the duo's impact, Hines {{stated that}} he felt [...] "what we were doing brought a twist to the game without {{watering}} anything down. If you were only hearing <b>our</b> radio <b>stuff,</b> you had one impression of us, but if you got the album then you realized {{there was a lot}} more depth there".|$|R

2500|$|An {{untitled}} record (typically {{known as}} LP5 or simply Autechre) followed in 1998.

60|$|It {{required}} no {{revolution of}} his nature {{to learn to}} calculate the range and fire a field gun or to march the goose-step. It was a mere matter of training. Our material achievement {{is the product of}} our intellect. It is knowledge, and knowledge, like coin, is interchangeable. It is not wrapped up in the heredity of the new-born child, but is something to be acquired afterward. Not so with <b>our</b> soul <b>stuff,</b> which is the product of an evolution which goes back to the raw beginnings of the race. <b>Our</b> soul <b>stuff</b> is not a coin to be pocketed by the first chance comer. The Japanese cannot pocket it any more than he can thrill to short Saxon words or we can thrill to Chinese hieroglyphics. The leopard cannot change its spots, nor can the Japanese, nor can we. We are thumbed by the ages into what we are, and by no conscious inward effort can we in a day rethumb ourselves. Nor can the Japanese in a day, or a generation, rethumb himself in our image.|$|R

5000|$|Brother reunited in {{the studio}} in 1971 to record two songs: [...] "Sending Money" [...] and [...] "Second Time Around The Woodpile", in a session financed by Kurt Winter.

5000|$|Some {{people say}} that <b>our</b> late <b>stuff</b> sounds happy, but I have never ever had the {{intention}} to express happy feelings in any way.

I just use other techniques to express it, like using even major keys.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Middle" [...] {{reflects}} these trying {{times for}} the band with lyrics about [...] "Don't write yourself off yet" [...] when feeling [...] "left out or looked down on." [...] The band decided to finance the recording of the album and decided to keep things simple on the new record rather than experiment, as they had done on previous records. [...] "On <b>our</b> new <b>stuff,</b> rather than challenging ourselves by getting real experimental, we kind of went in the other direction, challenging ourselves by getting very simple." ...|$|R
