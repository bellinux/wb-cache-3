40|$|On the 26 th of January 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court in Sweden gave five rulings which greatly {{affect the}} {{possibility}} to keep a close company within a family by transferring the ownership of the company to the next generation. The five rulings concern {{the interpretation of the}} prerequisite, same or similar activity, which can be found in section 57, clause 4 of the Swedish Income Tax Act.      The prerequisite is fulfilled when an entire or parts of a business is transferred to another close company and the receiving company’s business activity is {{within the framework of the}} transferring company’s business activity or when the companies have a similar connection. Depending on which shares that are being evaluated, the prerequisite can refer to both the shares in the receiving or the transferring company. When the prerequisite is fulfilled, a standardized amount of the business income will be taxed as capital gains and the surplus will be taxed as earned income. This tax treatment will continue as long as the <b>original</b> <b>shareholder</b> or a family member is active in either of the companies.   The present interpretation of the prerequisite results in problems when shareholders want to transfer ownership of the company to the next generation and at the same time place some of the business income in a passive asset management company. The current interpretation of the prerequisite shows that the shares in the asset management company are affected and will continue to be affected by the previous business activity, when it is controlled by the next generation. Therefore, the special tax treatment will continue to affect the <b>original</b> <b>shareholder.</b>   The current interpretation of the prerequisite results in a more favorable tax treatment when the <b>original</b> <b>shareholder</b> sells the company to a third party instead of transferring ownership to the next generation...|$|E

50|$|Sealaska {{shareholders}} {{will vote}} on June 23, 2007 whether to enroll qualified descendants of <b>original</b> <b>shareholders</b> by issuing them 100 shares of life estate stock in Sealaska. If the proposal passes, about 5,500 additional shareholders could be immediately enrolled, with additional descendants being enrolled when they reach age 18. However, unlike shares of <b>original</b> <b>shareholders,</b> the new shares would expire on the descendant's death {{and could not be}} willed or gifted. To be eligible, descendants must be children or grandchildren of <b>original</b> Sealaska <b>shareholders,</b> must be of at least one-quarter Alaska Native descent, and must not be a member of any other regional corporation unless through inheritance or gift. One effect of passage would be to dilute the corporate dividends and voting power of current shareholders. Shareholders will also vote whether to grant senior shareholders an additional 100 shares (nonvoting life estate) and whether to give 100 shares of life estate stock to eligible Alaska Natives born before 1972 who were not enrolled in Sealaska ("leftouts").|$|R
