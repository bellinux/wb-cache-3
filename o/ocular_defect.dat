60|$|I {{dropped a}} form of {{consolation}} {{which seemed to be}} encouraging me in the persuasion that my discontent was the chief evil in the world, and my benefit the soul of good in that evil. May there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philosophy is the formula of his personality? In certain branches of science we can ascertain our personal equation, the measure of difference between our own judgments and an average standard: may there not be some corresponding correction of our personal partialities in moral theorising? If a squint or other <b>ocular</b> <b>defect</b> disturbs my vision, I can get instructed in the fact, be made aware that my condition is abnormal, and either through spectacles or diligent imagination I can learn the average appearance of things: is there no remedy or corrective for that inward squint which consists in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of mental balance? In my conscience I saw that the bias of personal discontent was just as misleading and odious as the bias of self-satisfaction. Whether we look through the rose-coloured glass or the indigo, we are equally far from the hues which the healthy human eye beholds in heaven above and earth below. I began to dread ways of consoling which were really a flattering of native illusions, a feeding-up into monstrosity of an inward growth already disproportionate; to get an especial scorn for that scorn of mankind which is a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claims; to watch with peculiar alarm lest what I called my philosophic estimate of the human lot in general, should be a mere prose lyric expressing my own pain and consequent bad temper. The standing-ground worth striving after seemed to be some Delectable Mountain, whence I could see things in proportions as little as possible determined by that self-partiality which certainly plays a necessary part in our bodily sustenance, but has a starving effect on the mind.|$|E

50|$|Ocular disc {{dysplasia}} is {{the most}} notable <b>ocular</b> <b>defect</b> of the disease. An abnormal development in the optic stalk causes optic disc dysplasia, which {{is caused by a}} mutation in the Pax2 gene. The nerve head typically resembles the morning glory disc anomaly, but has also been described as a coloboma. A coloboma is the failure to close the choroid fissure, which is the opening from the ventral side of the retina in the optic stalk. Despite the similarities with coloboma and morning glory anomaly, significant differences exist such that optic disc dysplasia cannot be classified as either one entity.Optic disc dysplasia is noted by an ill-defined inferior excavation, convoluted origin of the superior retinal vessels, excessive number of vessels, infrapapillary pigmentary disturbance, and slight band of retinal elevation adjacent to the disk. Some patients have normal or near normal vision, but others have visual impairment associated with the disease, though it is not certain if this is due only to the dysplastic optic nerves, or a possible contribution from macular and retinal malformations. The retinal vessels are abnormal or absent, in some cases having small vessels exiting the periphery of the disc. There {{is a great deal of}} clinical variability.|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{photosensitive}} epilepsy {{are susceptible to}} seizures due to photoparoxysmal response (PPR). This response adversely precipitates factors that modify the functional status of the visual system. Such factors {{may or may not}} be evident superficially, but may lead to <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> due to trauma, hormonal imbalance, abnormal intraocular pressure (IOP), or any other reflex-inducing stimuli. The extent to which photosensitive epileptic patients suffer from PPR-related <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> has not been documented fully. In this investigation, <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> in patients with {{photosensitive epilepsy}} are studied using visual-evoked response (VER). A total of 212 photosensitive epileptic patients were studied to ascertain the magnitude and distribution of <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> using the changes in EEG and visual-evoked potential (VEP); 51 % of the patients were female, the age range was 146 years. The major <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> and complications found were visual field defects, optic nerve abnormalities, nystagmus, cataracts, amblyopia, and migraine. These findings were analyzed according to age and sex. The relationship between the ocular abnormalities and the interpretations of the changes in the characteristics of the VEP indicated that optic-related atrophies, visual defects, optic neuritis, chiasmal compression, nystagmus, migraine headache, cataracts, and amblyopia were prevalent in photosensitive epileptic patients at varying degrees. The results showed that although <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> in photosensitive epilepsy may not be obvious differentially, VEP can be used in their diagnosis, contrary to earlier studies reporting that VEP is not of much value in epilepsy diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|As exogenously {{administered}} RA {{suppressed the}} expression of the RA synthesizing enzymes, further investigation on whether this would lead to deficiency in endogenous RA concentrations was conducted. Results showed that exogenously administered RA significantly reduced the endogenous RA level in the head region with C 57 embryos showing a greater reduction than ICR embryos. In addition, detailed morphological and histological studies were conducted to determine if RA treatment caused early embryonic changes with strain difference. When compared with ICR embryos, C 57 embryos exhibited more pronounced responses to RA, including developmental retardation, underdevelopment of the anterior neural plate and absence of or smaller optic pit/optic vesicle formation. However, RA treatment did not cause abnormal apoptosis in the early stages in both strains. Since the teratogenic effect of RA is highly developmental stage-dependent, it is possible that there is a difference in the developmental stage between these 2 mouse strains at the time of RA injection. Indeed, {{it was found that the}} developmental stage of ICR embryos was approximately 6 hours ahead of C 57 embryos. However, the role that this factor plays in the differential strain susceptibility to RA can be excluded since C 57 fetuses were still 3 times more susceptible to developing anophthalmia/microphthalmia than ICR fetuses that were subject to RA treatment at equivalent developmental stages. Comparison of susceptibility to RA-induced anophthalmia/microphthalmia was also made among heterozygous fetuses obtained from reciprocal matings between C 57 and ICR male and female mice, and those in homozygous ICR and C 57 fetuses. Results showed that the C 57 strain has conferred both genetic predisposition and maternal effects in increasing the embryo's susceptibility to RA-induced <b>ocular</b> <b>defects.</b> Since the type of RA-induced <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> mimic those that developed in Raldh 2 null mutant embryos, the effect of RA treatment on {{the expression of}} RA synthesizing enzymes, Raldh 2 and Raldh 3, and the RA-inducible gene Cyp 26 a 1, as well as some early eye development genes were examined. Exogenously administered RA reduced the mRNA expression levels of Raldh 2, Raldh 3 and Cyp 26 a 1 in the head region, with C 57 embryos showing a greater reduction than ICR embryos. Taken together, results of this thesis suggest that there is a strain difference in susceptibility to RA-induced <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> in which exogenously applied RA suppresses the expression of RA synthesizing enzymes and leads to endogenous RA deficiency. This finding may shed light on understanding why both excess and deficiency of RA can lead to similar types of <b>ocular</b> <b>defects.</b> To determine if there are strain differences in the susceptibility to RA-induced <b>ocular</b> <b>defects,</b> two mouse strains were used. They are C 57 BL/ 6 J (C 57), mice that spontaneously develop <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> and ICR mice, which are not prone to developing <b>ocular</b> <b>defects.</b> Detailed time and dose response studies were conducted and eye defects were examined in near-term fetuses. C 57 fetuses were found to be significantly more susceptible to RA-induced anophthalmia/microphthalmia than ICR fetuses. Vitamin A (retinol) and its most active metabolite, all- trans retinoic acid (RA) is essential for vision in the adult and for eye development in the embryo. It is well documented that in humans, excess intake or deficiency of vitamin A or RA is associated with congenital <b>ocular</b> <b>defects</b> such as microphthalmia. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the pathogenic mechanism of RA-induced developmental <b>ocular</b> <b>defects.</b> Lau, Wing Sze Josephine.

40|$|Collagen XVIII, a proteoglycan, is a {{component}} of basement membranes (BMs).

40|$|Aphakia (lack of lens) {{is a rare}} human {{congenital}} disorder {{with its}} genetic etiology largely unknown. Even in model organisms, very few mutations are known to result in such a drastic <b>ocular</b> <b>defect.</b> In this study, we have shown that homozygous deletion of Nf 1, the Ras GTPase gene underlying human neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome, causes lens dysgenesis in mouse. Although early lens specification proceeded normally in Nf 1 mutants, lens induction was disrupted due to deficient cell proliferation. Further analysis showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling was initially elevated in the invaginating lens placode, but by the lens vesicle stage, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced. Only after intraperitoneal treatment of U 0126, an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, was lens development restored in Nf 1 mutants. Hyperactive Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is known to cause neuro-cardiofacial-cutaneous (NCFC) syndromes in humans.
