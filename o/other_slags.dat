Two 4 -h leaching stages conducted at ambient temperature with a solution containing ammonia and carbon dioxide dissolved manganese and iron as their carbamate complexes.

This study uses basic oxygen steel slag (BOS) from a U. K. feedstock. Batch experiments demonstrated the effective removal of phosphorus with varying initial pH, initial P concentration, clast size, and ionic strength to represent environmental conditions. Continuous flow column experiments, operated for 406 days, with an influent P concentration of 1 − 50 mg/L (typical of domestic and dairy parlour waste) achieved removal of up to 62 %; a second set of column experiments running for 306 days with an influent P concentration of 100 − 300 mg/L achieved a maximum effective removal of 8. 39 mg/g. This figure is higher than that for <b>other</b> <b>slags</b> reviewed in this study (e. g., EAF Slag 3. 93 mg/g and NZ melter slag 1. 23 mg/g).

The final slag tapped from the BF has been investigated extensively as it can be collected directly.

The samples were identified into three groups according to their morphological, mineralogical, and chemical properties: (1) tuyere slags originating from the reactions between ash and dripping slags; (2) bosh slags in the CaO-SiO-AlO-MgO-FeO system, with a CaO/SiO weight ratio of around 1. 50, and AlO and MgO concentrations close to those of final slags; and (3) coke ash that did not react with bosh slags.

However, {{due to the fact that}} ladle furnaces(LF) have only been constructed in significant numbers since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, the relatively low slag volume in comparison to the <b>other</b> <b>slags</b> and also the high variability in slag chemistry, very few papers have been published on the recycling of ladle slag as separate materials. Studies reveal that there is significant percent calcium aluminate in ladle furnace slags which is the main compound of ladle fluxes. These fluxes are widely used to clean steel production processes. Hence, using of ladle furnace slags as a part of ladle fluxes can be considered as an economical recovery for these materials. In current study, the LF slags of Mobarakeh Steel Company (MSC) was separated from metallic part and also was crashed and sized. This powder was blended with some minerals in order to meet different chemical composition of synthetic fluxes. Plant trials were conducted to illustrate the useful chemical composition of flux through assessing the effect of LF slag addition on some criteria such as ladle slag fluidity and raw materials consumption.

50|$|While {{the large}} amount of {{automation}} helps produce castings with no shrinkage and little segregation, continuous casting is of no use if the metal is not clean beforehand, or becomes 'dirty' during the casting process. One of the main methods through which hot metal may become dirty is by oxidation, which occurs rapidly at molten metal temperatures (up to 1700 °C for steel); inclusions of gas, slag or undissolved alloys may also be present. To prevent oxidation, the metal is isolated from the atmosphere as much as possible. To achieve this, exposed liquid metal surfaces are covered - by the shrouds, {{or in the case of}} the ladle, tundish and mould, by synthetic slag.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} of carbonaceous materials (metallurgical coke, natural graphite and HDPE/coke blends) with three EAF slags [FeO: 24 % to 32 %]. Experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1500 °C- 1600 °C) with off-gases (CO, CO 2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements. Estimation of slag foaming behaviour was determined from the droplet volume changes calculated using specialized software. At 1550 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke due to increased surface tension due to sulphur. At 1550 °C, slag 1 was initially non-wetting on natural graphite due to gas entrapment in the slag droplet; the wetting improved after that. <b>Other</b> <b>slags</b> showed comparatively better wetting. At 1600 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke. Slags showed a shift from non-wetting to wetting behaviour with natural graphite. Slag/coke reactions produced high off-gases levels causing extensive FeO reduction; gas entrapment in the slag was poor (small volume droplets). Slag/natural graphite interactions revealed both slow gas generation rates and FeO reduction, and excellent gas entrapment (higher droplet volumes) with minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels. The iron oxide reduction rates were determined to be 1. 54 x 10 - 5 and 4. 2 x 10 - 6 mol. cm- 2 /sec (Slag 1, 1550 °C) for metallurgical coke and natural graphite respectively. Slag interactions with coke/HDPE blends showed increasing off-gas levels with increasing HDPE levels. Blend# 3 produced the highest off-gas levels, extensive FeO reduction and displayed significantly higher slag foaming and better wetting compared to coke. Our line on trends compared well for slag/carbon interactions and resulted in deceased specific energy consumption and carbon usage and increased productivity.

40|$|The antique Lovignanaz mine (also {{known as}} Molina mine) {{is located in}} the western side of the Clavalité valley (1350 - 1425 m a. s. l.), to the South of the Fénis village, in the {{southern}} side of the Aosta Valley (Italy). The mine galleries are developed within chloriteschists, talcschists and metagabbros transposed with calcschists belonging to the Piedmont nappe (Zermatt-Saas zone). The rocks hosting the Fe-Cu sulphide mineralization show blueschist to eclogite facies mineral associations like those studied in Saint-Marcel rocks (Martin et al., 2008, and ref. therein). The mineralization is characterized by disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrite associated with minor ilmenite, rutile, pyrrhotite and magnetite (Fénis. Une communauté au fil de l'histoire, 2000 and ref. therein). The oldest galleries were dug with techniques described by Agricola in De Re Metallica (1556) and have been attributed to the Romans. These techniques consist in excavation along mineralized layers after “fire-setting”, that is after weakening the rocks with a fire (De Re Metallica, book V). Other galleries have been excavated with more recent techniques, revealing the use of explosives, and have been attributed to XVIII-XIX centuries mining activity (Gerbore E. E., in: Fénis…, op. cit.). The remnants of a furnace for rock-roasting have been found along {{the right side of the}} Clavalité river (lat. N 45 ° 41 ’ 46 ’’; long. E 7 ° 29 ’ 51 ’’). In the same site, slags with charcoal and red burnt soil, probably related to an old activity, were observed during the field work. Several glassy slags, maybe produced during XVIII-XIX centuries mining activity, were found below a large landslide that partly covers the mine adits. Near the oldest mine entrances traces of old working instrument have been found. These mines were also used to extract millstones: few metres from the mine entrances in the Mouilé locality (Fénis…, op. cit.), some of these stones are still unexcavated on the rock walls. In the lower part of the valley, in correspondence of Miserègne village (Fénis), there is a dump where many large slags with charcoal fragments are piled up. Some of these fragments were analyzed with 14 C method and one of them has been dated to IV century b. C [...] This age is the oldest found for charcoal associated to slags of the Cu mines in the Aosta Valley. <b>Other</b> <b>slags</b> from the Saint Marcel valley yielded early medieval ages (Tumiati et al., 2005). The Lovignanaz mining site has been destroyed by landslide events, the last one having occurred in 2000, which partly covered mine entrances and other structures linked to mining activity. The presence of structural lineaments and the practice of “fire-setting” during mining activity may have contributed to trigger the landslide. References: AAVV, 2000, Fénis.

The age of some of them is unknown and often the slag heaps are the sole vestiges of metallurgical activities. Such {{is the case of}} Miséregne (Fénis), where the village is built on an enormous slag deposit. We performed radiocarbon dating on charcoal fragments included in the slags and obtained ages comprised between the 4 th and 1 st century BC. So far, these are the most ancient ages for early mining activity in the Aosta Valley, probably carried out by the local population of the Salassi. We studied the slags following a petrologic approach. The occurrence of matte inclusions in the slags indicates that the processed raw minerals were Cu-Fe sulfides. Relying on morphologic and micro-textural features, we classified the slags into three categories, i. e., coarse, massive and flat, as suggested by Addis (2013). In all the slag classes the most abundant phase is olivine. Other common phases are spinel group minerals and sulfides, mainly pyrrhotite and bornite solid solutions. The olivine crystal shapes allowed us to qualitatively estimate the degree of undercooling (ΔT) and the rate of cooling of the slags: the coarse slags show a high ΔT; the massive slags seem to record an initial, long-lasting low-ΔT stage, followed by an increase in the cooling rate; the flat slags underwent a brief low-ΔT stage, followed by a sudden marked increase in ΔT. Combining this information with the slag bulk chemistry, the sulfide compositions, the slag morphology and the presence of inclusions of charcoal, quartz and <b>other</b> <b>slag</b> fragments, we hypothesize that the massive and coarse slags come from the lower and, respectively, the upper portion of the same slag contained in the furnace, while the flat ones were tapped slags.

Apart from iron, the material contains, by weight, 0.6 percent of carbon, 0.153 percent of silicon, 0.092 percent of phosphorus, and <b>other</b> elements. Numerous <b>slag</b> inclusions found in the steel are typical for medieval iron smelting technology. Part of the blade was hardened by quenching. Unlike the hilt, the blade would have been fully functional as a weapon of war. The surface of the blade is covered with deep scratches along its length, a result of intensive cleaning from rust before every coronation, probably with sand or brick powder. Inactive spots of corrosion may be also found on the entire surface.|$|R

50|$|Metalworking {{picked up}} {{quickly in the}} Late Chimú periods. Some Chimú {{artisans}} worked in metal workshops divided into sections for each specialized treatment of metals: plating, gold, stamping, lost-wax, pearl, the watermark, and embossing wooden molds. These techniques produced large variety of objects, such as cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, crowns, etc. They used arsenic to harden the metals after they were cast. Large-scale smelting {{took place in a}} cluster of workshops at Cerro de los Cemetarios. The process starts with ore extracted from mines or a river, which is heated to very high temperatures and then cooled. The result is a group of prills (small round sections of copper, for example) in a mass of <b>slag</b> (<b>other</b> materials which are not useful for metallurgy). The prills are then extracted by crushing the slag, and then melted together to form ingots, which were fashioned into various items.|$|R
