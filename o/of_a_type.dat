5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle).

Brown bowls are <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E

5|$|First {{observed}} in September 2006, the supernova SN 2006gy, which {{occurred in a}} galaxy called NGC 1260 (240 million light-years away), is the largest and, until confirmation of luminosity of SN 2005ap in October 2007, the most luminous supernova ever observed. The explosion was at least 100 times more luminous than any previously observed supernova, with the progenitor star being estimated 150 times more massive than the Sun. Although this had some characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> Ia supernova, Hydrogen {{was found in the}} spectrum. It is thought that SN 2006gy is a likely candidate for a pair-instability supernova. SN 2005ap, which was discovered by Robert Quimby who also discovered SN 2006gy, was about twice as bright as SN 2006gy and about 300 times as bright as a normal type II supernova.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables.

5|$|Males {{appear to}} reach {{maturity}} at around 45â50mm, at between 9 and 12 months, {{and at this}} size begin to develop a grey to brownish yellow wash beneath the chin. This indicates {{the development of a}} vocal sac and thus an ability to commence calling behaviour. Females reach sexual maturity at two years; those smaller than 65mm are not seen in amplexus; this length is not reached until the second season after metamorphosis. The frog is not <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> that only breeds once. Females can shed up to 26% of their weight when spawning, while males have also been seen to lose weight during breeding, because they are eating less. The weight lost during the breeding season is typically regained from January to September.|$|E

5|$|NGC 7424 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light years distant, it is about 100,000 light years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable {{and was replaced by}} lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> Ib supernova. A massive star of spectral type F, A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a WolfâRayet star.|$|E
5|$|The Conservation Priority List (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of breeds {{for which}} {{conservation}} is a priority. Published annually, {{the list is}} used {{as the foundation for}} all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, hatcheries and breeders. This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. Breeds are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds, or proof that they are a true breed, instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E
5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a base text but {{did not include the}} Gospel of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the Gospel of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E
