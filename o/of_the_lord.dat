40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} "Observance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper in Pentecostal Churches" {{attempts to}} introduce <b>the</b> observance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper in <b>the</b> Apostolic Church, including its pastoral aspects. Included {{in this is}} an outlined discussion on the same theme. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work introduces characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pentecostal Movement in general, and then its representative in the Czech Republic, the Apostolic Church, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> its historical- theological development. The second part adds some historical moments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remembrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper in this context. The subsequent discussion then more closely examines <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceremony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper in <b>the</b> Pentecostal environment, especially within the Apostolic Church. The third part discloses <b>the</b> specific practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper in <b>the</b> churches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apostolic Church. This comes from foundational documents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church and survey-based research. The final part discusses <b>the</b> pastoral aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper, working from information attained from the surveys, life experiences and finally from selected sermons related to <b>the</b> remembrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hohenburg were <b>the</b> <b>lords</b> <b>of</b> Thann.

40|$|Commemoration {{proclamation}} and communion as aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord’s</b> Supper. In 1 Corinthians 10 : 16, 17 and 11 : 25, 26 {{the apostle}} Paul refers to three aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper, viz. commemoration, proclamation and communion Close examination of these passages reveals important evidence for <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three stated aspects. At <b>the</b> institution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supper Jesus said: "Do {{this in my}} memory. " By these words he did not mean his personal memory nor a mere remembrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical event <b>of</b> his crucifixion, but <b>the</b> commemoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> his crucifacion, i. e. our salvation and redemption. <b>The</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper does not only serve as a proclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> death, per se, but also as an injunction to public proclamation of his death. This public proclamation consists of either singing his praise after celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord's</b> Supper or making known his grace by word and deed in our daily life. By the bread and wine <b>of</b> his Supper <b>the</b> <b>Lord</b> reassures us <b>of</b> an already existing communion between Him and us; and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union between ourselves as believers. This union of believers is a condition {{as well as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord’s</b> Supper...|$|R

5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord</b> High Steward, acted as judge and jury.

The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lord</b> High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers.
