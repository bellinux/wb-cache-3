25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) {{and gene}} splicing are terms {{that apply to}} the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the <b>oncomouse</b> (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E

50|$|The corporatization {{of biology}} through the {{alteration}} of nature through technology {{is also a}} theme explored by Haraway. The <b>OncoMouse</b> is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature's chance of developing cancer. Until 2005, American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the <b>OncoMouse,</b> reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity. This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment, as well as ethical questions around class and race. Increasing breast cancer rates in Black women are discussed in eco-feminist analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space. Haraway in particular {{raises the question of}} whether modifying and expending a live commodity like <b>OncoMouse</b> is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|In {{a strong}} dissent written by Binnie J. with McLachlin C.J., Arbour, and Major JJ. concurring, they {{agreed with the}} {{reasoning}} of the Federal Court of Appeal and were {{of the opinion that}} the engineered <b>oncomouse</b> is an “extraordinary scientific achievement” and an inventive “composition of matter” within the meaning of s.2 of the Patent Act. Additionally, Binnie J. stated that other jurisdictions with comparable legislation including the United States, Europe, Japan and New Zealand, among others, have held the <b>oncomouse</b> to be patentable.|$|E

50|$|Harvard College {{researchers}} (the respondents) {{developed a}} {{process by which}} they could create transgenic animals whose genomes are altered by a cancer-promoting gene (called an activated oncogene). The researchers injected the oncogene into fertilized mouse eggs close to the one-cell stage and implanted them into a female host mouse where they developed to term. The resulting offspring were then tested for {{the presence or absence}} of the oncogene. Those with the gene are referred to as “founder” mice and are mated with unaltered mice. Offspring that contain the oncogene and have every cell in their body affected (including germ cells and somatic cells) by it are referred to as <b>oncomice.</b> <b>Oncomice</b> are useful for carcinogenic studies as they are more susceptible to carcinogens. Such mice can be given material suspected of being a carcinogen and if tumours develop, it is an indication that the material is carcinogenic.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTumors induced in {{conditional}} <b>oncomice</b> {{can show}} remarkable different responses to subsequent oncogene deprivation. Complete sustained regression, concomitant with massive differentiation and/or apoptosis, and partial regression are both observed. In the latter case, tumor growth either resumes without being dependent any {{longer on the}} oncogene, or requires reactivation of the oncogene in cells that have become dormant. These models reflect many of the features we also witness in human cancer and can therefore assist us in understanding the underlying mechanisms and in designing more effective treatment protocols...|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} insert, alter or remove genes in model organisms allowed {{scientists}} {{to study the}} genetic elements of human diseases. Genetically modified mice were created in 1984 that carried cloned oncogenes that predisposed them to developing cancer. The technology has also been used to generate mice with genes knocked out. The first recorded knockout mouse was created by Mario R. Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies in 1989. In 1992 <b>oncomice</b> with tumor suppressor genes knocked out were generated. Creating Knockout rats is much harder and only became possible in 2003.|$|R

25|$|Genetically {{modified}} mice are {{the most}} common animal model for transgenic research. Transgenic mice are currently being used to study a variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease. The two most common types of genetically modified mice are knockout mice and <b>oncomice.</b> Knockout mice are a type of mouse model that uses transgenic insertion to disrupt an existing gene’s expression. In order to create knockout mice, a transgene with the desired sequence is inserted into an isolated mouse blastocyst using electroporation. Then, homologous recombination occurs naturally within some cells, replacing the gene of interest with the designed transgene. Through this process, researchers were able to demonstrate that a transgene can be integrated into the genome of an animal, serve a specific function within the cell, and be passed down to future generations.|$|R
50|$|Genetically {{modified}} mice {{are used}} extensively in research as models of human disease. Mice are a useful model for genetic manipulation and research, as their {{tissues and organs}} are {{similar to that of}} a human and they carry virtually all the same genes that operate in humans. They also have advantages over other mammals, in regards to research, in that they are available in hundreds of genetically homogeneous strains. Also, due to their size, they can be kept and housed in large numbers, reducing the cost of research and experiments. The most common type is the knockout mouse, where the activity of a single (or in some cases multiple) genes are removed. They have been used to study and model obesity, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, substance abuse, anxiety, aging and Parkinson disease. Transgenic mice generated to carry cloned oncogenes and knockout mice lacking tumor suppressing genes have provided good models for human cancer. Hundreds of these <b>oncomice</b> have been developed covering a wide range of cancers affecting most organs of the body and they are being refined to become more representative of human cancer. The disease symptoms and potential drugs or treatments can be tested against these mouse models.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>OncoMouse</b> or Harvard mouse {{is a type}} of {{laboratory}} mouse (Mus musculus) that has been genetically modified using modifications designed by Philip Leder and Timothy A Stewart of Harvard University to carry a specific gene called an activated oncogene (v-Ha-ras {{under the control of the}} mouse mammary tumor virus promoter). The activated oncogene significantly increases the mouse’s susceptibility to cancer, and thus makes the mouse suitable for cancer research. The rights to the invention were owned by DuPont until recently. The USPTO found that the patent expired in 2005, which means that the <b>Oncomouse</b> is now free for use by other parties (although the name is not, as [...] "OncoMouse" [...] is a registered trademark).|$|E
50|$|The {{court found}} {{in favour of}} the government, ruling that higher life forms are not patentable. The opinion of the court was written by Bastarache J. with L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, and LeBel JJ. concurring. The sole {{question}} before the court was whether the words “manufacture” or “composition of matter,” {{in the context of}} the Patent Act, are broad enough to encompass higher life forms such as the <b>oncomouse.</b> The court found that they are not. Bastarache J. stated that the determination of the patentability of higher life forms such as the <b>oncomouse</b> is beyond the authority of the court and would be a massive change in the current patent regime. The majority indicated that as there are significant public policy concerns at play, Parliament is best suited to address this issue.|$|E
50|$|Justice Binnie {{stated that}} {{once it is}} conceded that the genetically altered <b>oncomouse</b> egg meets the {{criteria}} for patentability; {{there is no reason}} for denying patentability to the resulting <b>oncomouse</b> on the basis that it is not an “invention” as defined by the Patent Act. He stressed that s.40 of the Patent Act does not give the Commissioner discretion to refuse a patent on public policy considerations. Additionally, Binnie J. emphasized the fact that Parliament has repealed and avoided including provisions in the Patent Act dealing with the morality of inventions as an indication that these aspects of public policy should be dealt using other regulatory regimes. He identified the Assisted Human Reproduction Act as an example of specialized legislated enacted to deal with public policy considerations similar to the ones at play in this case.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Scaffold Attachment Factor B 1 (SAFB 1) is a {{multifunctional}} protein {{which has}} been implicated in breast cancer previously. We recently generated SAFB 1 knockout mice (SAFB 1 -/-), but pleiotropic phenotypes including high lethality, dwarfism associated with low IGF-I levels, and infertility and subfertility in male and female mice, respectively, do not allow for straightforward tumorigenesis studies in these mice. Therefore, we asked whether SAFB 1 heterozygosity would influence tumor development and progression in MMTV-Wnt- 1 <b>oncomice</b> or DMBA induced tumorigenicity, {{in a manner consistent}} with haploinsufficiency of the remaining allele. Methods We crossed female SAFB 1 +/- (C 57 B 6 / 129) mice with male MMTV-Wnt- 1 (C 57 B 6 /SJL) mice to obtain SAFB 1 +/+ /Wnt- 1, SAFB 1 +/- /Wnt- 1, and SAFB 1 +/- mice. For the chemical induced tumorigenesis study we treated 8 weeks old SAFB 1 +/- and SAFB +/+ BALB/c mice with 1 mg DMBA once per week for 6 weeks. Animals were monitored for tumor incidence and tumor growth. Tumors were characterized by performing H&E, and by staining for markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Results We did not detect significant differences in tumor incidence and growth between SAFB 1 +/+ /Wnt- 1 and SAFB 1 +/- /Wnt- 1 mice, and between DMBA-treated SAFB 1 +/+ and SAFB 1 +/- mice. Histological evaluation of tumors showed that SAFB 1 heterozygosity did not lead to changes in proliferation or apoptosis. There were, however, significant differences in the distribution of tumor histologies with an increase in papillary and cribriform tumors, and a decrease in squamous tumors in the SAFB 1 +/- /Wnt- 1 compared to the SAFB 1 +/+ /Wnt- 1 tumors. Of note, DMBA treatment resulted in shortened survival of SAFB 1 +/- mice compared to their wildtype littermates, however this trend did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Our data show that SAFB 1 heterozygosity does not influence Wnt- 1 or DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} {{held that}} the words “manufacture” and “composition of matter” are not sufficiently broad to include a higher life form such as the <b>oncomouse.</b> The court is {{of the opinion that}} “manufacture” denotes “a non-living mechanistic product or process” and does not imply a conscious, sentient living creature. The majority determined that the meaning of “composition of matter” can be ascertained by reference to the meaning of the words or phrases associated with them and thus is best read as not including higher life forms. The majority also referred to the Oxford English Dictionary definition of “composition” which is “a substance or preparation formed by combination or mixture of various ingredients” and concluded that the <b>oncomouse</b> cannot be understood in such terms. They also emphasized that higher life forms have unique qualities and characteristics that transcend the particular genetic matter of which they are composed.|$|E
50|$|The European Patent Office (EPO) {{concluded}} that {{the usefulness of the}} <b>oncomouse</b> in furthering cancer research satisfied the likelihood of substantial medical benefit, and outweighed moral concerns about suffering caused to the animal. In the original application, the claims referred to animals in general, but {{in the course of the}} proceedings, the patent was amended and finally maintained with claims limited to mice.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is used to}} create animal models of human diseases. Genetically modified mice {{are the most common}} genetically engineered animal model.

Potential cures can be tested against these mouse models. Also genetically modified pigs have been bred with the aim of increasing the success of pig to human organ transplantation.|$|E

These patent claims also extend to all non-human mammals whose genomes have been altered in a similar manner.
