50|$|Electric current can be {{directly}} measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves <b>breaking</b> the electrical <b>circuit,</b> which is sometimes inconvenient.

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of <b>breaking</b> <b>circuits</b> left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|R
25|$|To prevent electrocution, RCDs should {{operate within}} 25–40 {{milliseconds}} with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, {{the most common}} cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only <b>break</b> the <b>circuit</b> when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or <b>circuit</b> breaker to <b>break</b> the <b>circuit,</b> and certainly not do so fast enough to save a life.|$|R
40|$|A {{closer look}} at earlier work on IC defect sensitivities reveals that {{modeling}} the geometrical patterns only as conductors can be inaccurate in predicting the probability of failure of the circuit. This way of modeling considers also only one layer {{at a time and}} neglects any interrelationships, {{as is the case with}} transistors. Furthermore, the only kind of faults covered are of the short and <b>break</b> <b>circuit</b> types. We present a generalization that considers the layout as the union of a set of electrical elements and where depending upon the element the patterns have a significance other than simple conductors. This approach models sensitive areas for a larger coverage of faults including stuck-at transistors and possible performance degradations...|$|R

50|$|Reis {{does not}} seem to have {{realised}} the importance of not entirely <b>breaking</b> the <b>circuit</b> of the current; at all events, his metal spring was not practical for this, for it allowed the metal contacts to jolt too far apart, and thus interrupt the electric current.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the integrational properties of real GDP for 125 countries. Design/methodology/approach – The paper applies the Kwiatkowski et al. univariate test and a KPSS-type univariate test that accounts for multiple structural breaks – a test procedure proposed by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. The panel versions of the KPSS-type test, proposed by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. with and without structural breaks, are also applied. Findings – The paper finds that, while univariate tests with and without structural breaks provide mixed results on persistence, the panel test suggests that shocks to national output are persistent. Originality/value – This is a multi-country study that focuses on both developed and developing countries and uses more recent data to provide new and comparable evidence on the persistence of <b>output.</b> <b>Breaks,</b> Developing countries, Gross domestic product...|$|R

30|$|ECMO circuit: {{connected}} in series, a drainage cannula, a centrifugal pump, an oxygenator to oxygenate {{the blood and}} remove CO 2, and a return line. There is also a gas blender and a heat exchanger to warm the blood. Any <b>break</b> in the <b>circuit</b> upstream of the pump will lead to air entry. In contrast, any <b>circuit</b> <b>break</b> after the pump will cause blood loss. It is inadvisable to add an access to the circuit upstream of the pump (risk of air entry) [18].|$|R
50|$|Arcing horns are {{sometimes}} installed on air-insulated switchgear and transformers {{to protect the}} switch arm from arc damage.

50|$|If a surge {{comes down}} the line it will melt the {{connection}} between the central office and outside plant sides, as in a fuse, thereby protecting the equipment.

50|$|One {{mechanism}} {{is a small}} meltable pellet that holds down a spring. When the pellet melts, the spring is released, separating the contacts and <b>breaking</b> the <b>circuit.</b> The Tamura LE series, NEC Sefuse SF series, Microtemp G4A series, and Hosho Elmwood D series, for example, may use alloy pellets that contain copper, beryllium, and silver to melt at a precise temperature.|$|R

40|$|The Fiscal Compact {{has created}} new {{responsibilities}} {{in terms of}} quantitative measures of excess demand in the economy. The concept of structural budget balance is dependent on cycle values. As a consequence {{one of the primary}} responsibilities of economics is to build a good indicator of the magnitude of short term disequilibrium. Knowledge of the magnitude of the excess demand in the economy is essential for an appropriate application of the Fiscal Compact. The usual empirical concepts of output gap are not sufficiently well designed to give an accurate view of the negative excess demand when there are <b>output</b> <b>breaks</b> in the economy. The information produced by different (quasi-) official output gaps is quite often misleading, contributing to a rise in the unemployment rate. We propose a solution that might contribute to solve this problem that is clearly a crucial one for the PIIGS in times of crisis...|$|R
40|$|Chalmers University of Technology owns {{a hybrid}} power {{facility}} {{located on the}} island Hönö, in the archipelago of Gothenburg, Sweden. The aim of this project is to analyze and evaluate if the hybrid power facility is able to produce more energy than it consumes on an annual basis. The hybrid power facility was put in use {{two years ago when}} the solar panels, Naps Pallas, and the wind turbine, Windstar 3000, were purchased and installed. The solar panels consists of 15 solar cells and Windstar 3000 is a five-bladed wind turbine with a rated power of 3 kW. The solar panels have been generating electricity as expected, but Windstar 3000 was forced to be taken down a few days after installation due to not being properly mounted. Besides not being properly installed it lacked a functional breaking mechanism that protects the turbine from breaking at higher wind speeds. Nor did the inverter to the wind turbine have an optimal power curve, adapted to give optimal energy production. This caused the wind turbine to produce lower power than it was supposed to. To assure that the facility has a higher energy production than consumption, a system had to be designed and installed that collects the energy data from the facility. Due to lack of time only a part of the <b>breaking</b> <b>circuit</b> was made, the frequency measuring circuit. Arduino Nano was used for this purpose. The wind turbine had stopped working when this circuit, in combination with a part of another <b>breaking</b> <b>circuit,</b> was installed. Even though the wind turbine was taken down and analyzed, no errors were found and neither the breaking system or the final power curve could be tested. With help from older weather statistics and the data collection system, made with both Raspberry Pi 2 model B and Arduino Mega 2560, a conclusion could be made regarding the energy production of the non-functional Windstar 3000. This conclusion would prove that it would be possible for the wind turbine and the solar cells to produce enough energy to overcome the consumption of the hybrid power facility...|$|R
