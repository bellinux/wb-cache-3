5|$|Another {{objective}} {{to finding}} and defeating Malkil in Wizards & WarriorsIII {{is to find}} four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle's throne room where the evil wizard is located. To do this, Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} {{objects in the}} Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) are listed as dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt objects are {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> probably qualify when more is known about them.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or {{a mixture of}} lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E

60|$|During {{that time}} the boys also {{received}} visits from several private detectives, all anxious to take hold of the case, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>willing</b> {{to do so without}} first receiving a generous retainer.|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{the chin}} {{whiskers}} of the prophet--no!" [...] answered the guest. [...] "New York's {{as full of}} cheap Haroun al Raschids as Bagdad is of fleas. I've been held up for my story with a loaded meal pointed at my head twenty times. Catch anybody in New York giving you something for nothing! They spell curiosity and charity with {{the same set of}} building blocks. Lots <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>will</b> stake you to a dime and chop-suey; and a few <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>will</b> play Caliph to the tune of a top sirloin; but every one <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>will</b> stand over you till they screw your autobiography out of you with foot notes, appendix and unpublished fragments. Oh, I know what to do when I see victuals coming toward me in little old Bagdad-on-the-Subway. I strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper. I claim descent from the late Tommy Tucker, who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his pre-digested wheaterina and spoopju." ...|$|R
5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> win.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not quite that, lad, {{not quite}} that, for there's jealousy {{in the ranks}} the same as outside <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> though I warrant many <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>will</b> be glad to ask Corporal 'Lige's advice before this 'ere {{business}} is over.

5|$|The film {{opens with}} Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser furâ€”all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

[...] {{he whispered to}} himself; and then tears, bitter and scalding, flowed down his cheeks, {{moistening}} the spotless linen, but bringing some slight degree of comfort, because sleep quickly followed in their train.|$|R
25|$|The two armies stood face to {{face for}} a long time, with neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>willing</b> to {{initiate}} the attack. At last, Kopek launched an attack, and scattered Malik Kafur's soldiers. However, Malik Kafur soon rallied his men, and completely routed the Mongol army. Kebak was taken captive, {{when he was about}} to be killed by the Delhi soldiers.|$|R
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} {{have all been}} slightly altered from the original story in the novel.
