5|$|Upon {{assuming}} power, Suharto government adopted {{policy of}} neutrality in the Cold War, but was nevertheless quietly {{aligned with the}} Western bloc (including Japan and South Korea) {{with the objective of}} securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. Diplomatic relations with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in 30 September Movement (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of Association <b>of</b> <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Nations</b> (ASEAN) in August 1967.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{theoretically}} grounded empirical contribution aimed at shedding light on Japan's policy stance on East Asian neo-regionalism. It aims to examine the recent region-building process in East Asia. The dynamics in East Asia suggest that regional institutionalization, brought about by norm diffusion {{based on the idea}} of neo-regionalism, is likely to follow a progressive and evolutionary trajectory through the institutionalization of the Association <b>of</b> <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Nation</b> (ASEAN)  +  3 (South Korea, Japan and China). It provides a wide spectrum of regional-integrationist perspectives in order to offer as full a picture as possible of Japan's role in promoting regional integration in East Asia. The key finding of this article is that Japan has changed from a being “reluctant”, to becoming a “proactive” state in the context of regional collaboration in East Asia.

His own collections of poetry include Rib of Earth (1956), Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993).

5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association <b>of</b> <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Nations</b> (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

The article commences with an overview of the analytical instruments of constitutional economics in order to evaluate the success of a regional agreement on the basis of the ‘quality’ of its economic constitution.

3000|$|The role of WTO (World Trade Organization) in {{economic}} integration {{has been questioned}} since it came into force. Several studies (e.g., Rose 2004; Subramanian and Wei 2007) found that the WTO promotes trade strongly but unevenly. The WTO provides asymmetric treatment effects to different trade flows.

Panzar-Rosse H-statistic, Lerner index and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) are used as measures of competition, while Z-score, non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and equity ratio are used as measures of financial stability. Two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimates demonstrate that competition measured by H-statistic is positively related to Z-score and equity ratio, and negatively related to non-performing loan ratio. Conversely, market power measured by Lerner index is negatively related to Z-score and equity ratio and positively related to NPL ratio. These results strongly support the competition-stability view for ASEAN banks. We also capture the non-linear relationship between competition and financial stability by incorporating a quadratic term of competition in our models. The {{results show that the}} coefficient of the quadratic term of H-statistic is negative for the Z-score model given a positive coefficient of the linear term in the same model. These results support the non-linear relationship between competition and financial stability of the banking sector. The study contains significant policy implications for improving the financial stability of the commercial banks...|$|R

It shows that in many ASEAN member states (AMS) MF has developed to some significant degree, although the rate of growth (e. g. number of MFIs, number of depositors and debtors, total loans allocated, etc.) as well as the market structure of MF vary across member states. From the Indonesian case this study comes with two most interesting facts. First, majority of MSMEs do not have access to credit from banks and/or other formal non-bank financial institutions. Second, MF services or MFIs are growing fast, and the most popular MF program so far is Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR), or people business credit (i. e. a credit scheme without collateral), introduced during the SBY period...|$|R
40|$|The South China Sea is a {{sea with}} {{strategically}} important shipping lanes, {{an abundance of}} maritime resources, and potentially large amounts {{of oil and gas}} deposits. Because of the significance of the sea, China has claimed almost all of it, which has caused the Association <b>of</b> <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>Nation</b> members (ASEAN) whose countries surround the sea (Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines) to take a stance against the encroachment. The most important non-Chinese claimant in the dispute is the Philippines, which shares a mutual defense treaty with the United States. The dispute has been analyzed from a bilateral perspective between China and the Philippines. A theoretical analysis of the dispute has been conducted through a Neorealist paradigm. How the two countries define international law and engage in diplomatic and military policies has also been closely examined. China has not sought foreign intervention whether from a nation or international organization, while the Philippines has preferred as much multilateralism as possible. A recent Scarborough Shoal dispute between the two countries has changed the dynamic of the dispute, and in examining the event and its outcome an inevitable conclusion of military action has been reached...|$|R
