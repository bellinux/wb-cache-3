5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E

50|$|The sulky is {{designed}} to have little to no weight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> back, given their sensitive spine. A widely used model is the dorsal hitch, which involves only one shaft from the sulky that has negative weight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> harness. <b>The</b> dorsal hitch also allows easier going for <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> with free range of movement as opposed to confining shafts on either side. This often simplifies initial training to the sulky, as the shafts do not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> movement.|$|R
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Paramount Pictures {{purchased}} the film rights for White Dog in 1975, though the film itself was not produced until 1981, after Gary's suicide. Various {{changes were made}} from the original novel's story, including the removal of Gary himself and a tighter focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Gary's wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress as Paramount wanted the film to show a strong contrast between the loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog's random attacks. The novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer was converted into the character named Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. The novel's original ending was also changed {{to make it more}} pessimistic. Directed by Samuel Fuller and starring Paul Winfield and Kristy McNichol, the film's theatrical release was suppressed in the United States out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating from the NAACP that the film was racist. It was released internationally in France and the United Kingdom in 1982, and broadcast on various American cable television channels. Its first official American release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD.|$|E

25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.|$|E

Triatominae fed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> soon after ivermectin treatment showed high mortality, but this effect quickly declined for bugs fed at successive intervals after treatment. In conclusion, although ivermectin treatment may have a transient effect on peridomestic populations of Triatominae, {{it is not the}} treatment of choice for this situation. The study also showed that although the dogticks could become infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, this only occurred when feeding <b>on</b> <b>dogs</b> in <b>the</b> acute phase of infection, and {{there was no evidence of}} subsequent parasite development in the ticks...|$|R

Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that dog domestication occurred in Europe or Siberia, see Origin of the domestic dog. The traditional African dog is a descendant of dogs that had been interbred with local wolves in the East and came to Africa.

Archaeological records show that, from then <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> spread rapidly along the Nile into Sudan and even beyond. At the same time, migrations, trade, and transhumance took it deep into the Sahara. By 2000 BC, this moving frontier stopped for a long period.

Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883.
