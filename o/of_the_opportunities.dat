5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E

A wonderful era was possible for the human race. But the capitalist class failed. It made a shambles of civilization. Nor can the capitalist class plead not guilty. It knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Its wise men told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity,</b> its scholars and its scientists told it <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b> All that they said is there to-day in the books, just so much damning evidence against it. It would not listen. It was too greedy. It rose up (as it rises up to-day), shamelessly, in our legislative halls, and declared that profits were impossible without <b>the</b> toil <b>of</b> children and babes. It lulled its conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities, and allowed the suffering and misery of mankind to continue and to increase, in short, the capitalist class failed to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|R

The Genoese traders fled, bringing the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread.|$|E

25|$|The Bank of Toronto and Dominion Bank {{emerged from}} the war in 1945 {{stronger}} than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> of the post-war economy.|$|E

25|$|Decollectivization obviated the {{supervisory}} functions of low-level cadres, {{who no longer}} needed to oversee work on the collective fields.

Even those cadres not wholly devoted to increasing their own families' income found that to serve their fellow villagers as expected it was necessary to act as entrepreneurs.

25|$|Traditional Hindu and Islamic {{studies were}} no longer {{supported}} by the British Crown, and {{nearly all of the}} madrasahs lost their waqf (lit. financial endowment). Discontent by these reforms, Muslim and Hindu rebels initiated the first rebellion in 1857 which was suppressed by the British forces, followed by final abdication of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II, also the same year. Noting the sensitivity of this issue, Queen Victoria removed the East India Company and consolidated the power by gaining the control of subcontinent into British Empire. Directives issues by Queen Victoria led to the quick removal of Mughal symbols which spawned a negative attitude amongst some Muslims towards everything modern and western, and a disinclination to make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> available under the new regime. This tendency, had it continued for long, would have proven disastrous for the Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968–73 period, {{personal}} income became more concentrated and regional disparities became greater. Industrial expansion took place more vigorously in the Center-South Region, which had benefited {{most from the}} import substitution industrialization strategy. Its per-capita income considerably exceeded the national average, its infrastructure was more developed, and it had an adequate supply of skilled workers and professionals. The region was therefore {{able to take advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> and incentives offered by the military regime. Although a special regional development strategy existed for the Northeast, it promoted a distorted industrialization that benefited only a few of that region's large cities; the Northeast's linkages with the Center-South were stronger than its linkages within the region. The combination of a harsh climate, a highly concentrated land-tenure system, and an elite that consistently resisted meaningful change prevented the Northeast from developing effectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{new media}} {{industry}} shares an open association with many market segments {{in areas such}} as software/video game design, television, radio, mobile and particularly movies, advertising and marketing, through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the Internet. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the television industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar interactive advertising subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases advertising agencies have also set up new divisions to study new media. Public relations firms are also taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> in new media through interactive PR practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media to reach a mass audience of online social network users.|$|E

25|$|His career bears {{witness to}} his rare {{appreciation}} of where real power {{lay in the}} Roman polity and also <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> that prevailing circumstances were opening up for men of equestrian origins such as himself to share in that power. However, it also suggests that he also realized the likely limitations that the social co mpact still imposed on men originating from outside the charmed circle of the Senatorial Order. It would seem that, having made this analysis, he pursued the exercise of Real Power with a single-minded diligence as an equestrian. Within {{the constraints of the}} Imperial System of government, he {{seems to have been a}} highly effective statesman and administrator. It is possible that his premature death (however that came about) deprived Rome of the services of a statesman and a general who might have saved the Empire from the humiliations that were to be inflicted on it by Shapur I.|$|E
25|$|In 1835 Lord Macaulay's minute {{recommending that}} Western rather than Oriental {{learning}} predominate in the East India Company's education policy {{had led to}} numerous changes. In place of Arabic and Persian, the Western languages, history and philosophy were taught at state-funded schools and universities whilst religious education was barred. English became not only the medium of instruction but also the official language in 1835 in place of Persian, disadvantaging those who had built their careers around the latter language. Traditional Islamic studies were no longer supported by the state, and some madrasahs lost their waqf or endowment. The Indian rebellion of 1857 is held by nationalists to have ended in disaster for the Muslims, as Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal, was deposed. Power over the subcontinent was passed from the East India Company to the British Crown. The removal of the last symbol of continuity with the Mughal period spawned a negative attitude amongst some Muslims towards everything modern and western, and a disinclination to make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> available under the new regime.|$|E
