50|$|Mukomberanwa's sculptures showed human forms {{at various}} levels of {{abstraction}} and sometimes depicted animals, birds or spiritual feelings; most were highly polished, although {{in a few cases}} he would contrast smooth sections with areas of great roughness. He worked primarily in hard stone, using local materials such as <b>opal</b> <b>stone,</b> cobalt stone and other serpentines, especially a local variant called springstone found at Tengenenge.|$|E
5000|$|Some of Mukomberanwa's {{exhibition}} pieces, such as The Greedy One (1985) and The Corrupting Power of Money (1985), have toured worldwide; {{for example}} to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1990, where the works on display included examples {{from all the}} artists who had contributed to the 1971 Musée Rodin exhibition. The catalogue [...] "Chapungu: Culture and Legend - A Culture in Stone" [...] for the exhibition at Kew Gardens in 2000 depicts Nicholas’s sculptures My Experience (Springstone, 1992) on p. 58-59, Man in a Trance (Springstone, 1987) on p. 92-93, Women of Wisdom (<b>Opal</b> <b>stone,</b> 1987) on p. 102-103 and The Corrupting Power of Money (Limestone, 1985) on p. 114-115.|$|E

[Sidenote: Sir Percival meets two strange people] These, {{when they}} beheld Sir Percival, waited for him, and as Sir Percival drew nigh to them he {{perceived}} {{that they were}} of a very singular appearance. For {{both of them were}} clad altogether in green, and both of them wore about their necks very wonderful collars of wrought gold inset with <b>opal</b> <b>stones</b> and emeralds. And the face of each was like clear wax for whiteness; and the eyes of each were very bright, like jewels set in ivory. And these two neither laughed nor frowned, but only smiled continually. And that knight whom Sir Percival beheld was Sir Pellias, and the lady was the Lady Nymue of the Lake.|$|R

And the lady sang to Launcelot, and the young child looked up into her face and laughed and set his hand against her cheek. All this Queen Helen beheld; and she likewise beheld that the lady was of a very extraordinary appearance, being clad altogether in green that glistered and shone with a wonderful brightness. And she beheld that {{around the neck of}} the lady was a necklace of gold, inset with <b>opal</b> <b>stones</b> and emeralds; and she perceived that the lady's face was like ivory--very white and clear--and that her eyes, which were very bright, shone like jewels set into ivory. And she saw that the lady was very wonderfully beautiful, so that the beholder, looking upon her, felt a manner of fear--for that lady was Fay.|$|R
50|$|Colleen worked {{predominantly}} in Springstone (a local type of hard serpentine rock much used by Zimbabwean sculptors), {{but also}} used <b>Opal</b> <b>stone</b> (a softer variety of serpentine), for example for her major work “The Birth”, {{now part of}} the Chapungu permanent collection. She used both rough and polished stone in her sculpture, often leaving parts of the surface of the stone in its raw oxidised form to provide colour for hair or clothes, while creating expressive faces, arms and hands in the fully polished black stone. Skirts would sometimes be chiselled to a rough grey surface, while other clothing such as a blouse was stippled to a finer texture. The overall effect and subject-matter was instantly recognisable.|$|E
50|$|Many of Colleen’s {{works were}} {{exhibited}} and sold outside Zimbabwe. For example, they {{were included in}} travelling exhibitions {{of the work of}} Chapungu artists which were shown in Botanical Gardens in the UK and US. The catalogue “Chapungu: Culture and Legend - A Culture in Stone” for the exhibition at Kew Gardens in 2000 depicts Colleen’s sculptures “Growing Well” (a mother and baby in Springstone, 1997) on p. 28-29 and “Dancing Woman” (<b>Opal</b> <b>Stone,</b> 1993) on p. 64-65. Works in that exhibition included almost all the well-known “first-generation” of Zimbabwean sculptors, for example Joram Mariga, Henry Munyaradzi and Bernard Takawira. In this context, Colleen is usually described as being of the “second generation” but the terms are imprecise, as discussed by Celia Winter-Irving. In 2004, Colleen and Fabian Madamobe's sculpture was included in an exhibition at the Botanical Garden in Berlin. The catalogue illustrates her life-sized works “Playing Ball” and “Mother's Care”.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{references}} to l'École d'Étaples {{in the wake}} of an exhibition of those who were painting locally between 1880-1914. But while many of them painted out of doors, as was the new fashion in those years, their styles were too diverse to constitute a school. They ranged from the plein-air style of artists' colonies to the south, through Impressionism to Post Impressionism. Among some 200 individuals from three continents, subject matter was obviously varied. However, two broad tendencies can be observed in their work. One is the treatment of light, that recommended itself to those of an Impressionist tendency, such as Boudin and Le Sidaner among the French and Wilson Steer from England. In this connection, we have to thank the journalist and amateur painter Édouard Lévêque for putting into words its quality and giving the coastal area it eventual name. Originally from Amiens, he helped develop Le Touquet as a resort and was editor of its newspaper. The phrase 'Opal Coast' was coined in an article by him in Le journal de Paris-Plage in February 1911. [...] "Is there", he asked, [...] "anything natural that possesses this incessantly changing diversity of colour? Yes, the <b>opal,</b> that precious <b>stone</b> with its milky tones, projecting its series of red and green glints. So let our Côte d'Opale join company with the Côte d'Azur, the Côte d'Emeraude and the Côte d'Argent." ...|$|R
60|$|The chest {{had been}} full to the brim, {{and we spent}} the whole day, and {{the greater part of}} the next night, in a {{scrutiny}} of its contents. There had been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars--estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety--French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There was no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating. There were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and fine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy;--three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an <b>opal.</b> These <b>stones</b> had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments;--nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings;--rich chains--thirty of these, if I remember;--eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes;--five gold censers of great value;--a prodigious golden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion--but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at {{a million and a half}} of dollars; and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure. When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.|$|R
50|$|The {{mayor of}} each borough, called delegado, is {{appointed}} by {{the mayor of the}} city, although there have been attempts to make these posts popularly elected.The municipality has rolling hills, mountain ranges and flatlands. Most of the rolling hills cross the territory from south to north, paralleling the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí highway. Most plains are located in the north, and are of sedimentary soil with some protrusions of volcanic rock. Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and semi-dry in which the summers can be hot, with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.In most areas, various species of cacti can be seen such as the organ pipe and nopals, as well as the yucca. Trees adapted to dry climates include mesquite, willows and cypress, near streams and rivers. Animal life mostly consists of small mammals, deer, predatory birds and reptiles. In some areas, monarch butterflies can be seen as well. Nature reserves in the municipality include the Peña Colorado, Tángano, Parque Ecologicao Joya-La Barreta and the El Cimatario National Park.Near the city is the Sierra Gorda de Querétaro, part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, was declared by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. This protected area is very rugged terrain, filled with canyons, steep mountains, waterfalls and deep abysses with a total expansion of 24,803 hectares. The area contains 360 species of birds, 130 species of mammals, 71 of reptiles and twenty-three of amphibians. It also contains about thirty percent of the country's butterfly species including the endangered Humboldt, the Jaguar the Oso Negro and the Guacamaya. Plant species include 1,710 different species including endangered species and is considered {{to be one of the}} best-preserved forested areas in Mexico. The Missionary Route of Friar Junípero Serra passes through here as caves such as the Sótano del Barro are located here.The territory contains deposits of gold, silver, manganese, tin, mercury, lead, zinc, <b>opal,</b> quartz, cantera <b>stone</b> (for building) among other minerals.|$|R
