5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; <b>our</b> <b>only</b> sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is <b>our</b> <b>only</b> means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

The Revolutionary Committee decided to destroy the cathedral via explosives, and asked a local architect to organise it.

25|$|Bleda died in 445, {{with some}} historians speculating that {{his death was}} {{at the hands of}} Attila. With his brother gone, Attila was able to {{establish}} undisputed control over his subjects. In 447, Attila turned the Huns back toward the Eastern Roman Empire once more. His invasion of the Balkans and Thrace was devastating. The Eastern Roman Empire was already beset by internal problems, such as famine and plague, as well as riots and a series of earthquakes in Constantinople itself. A last-minute rebuilding of its walls preserved Constantinople unscathed. Victory over a Roman army left the Huns virtually unchallenged in Eastern Roman lands and they raided as far south as Thermopylae. Only disease forced them to retreat, and the war came to an end in 449 with an agreement in which the Romans agreed to pay Attila an annual tribute of 2100 pounds of gold. <b>Our</b> <b>only</b> first-hand account of conditions among the Huns and of Attila himself is by Priscus, an official in the peace embassy to Attila.|$|E

25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was <b>our</b> <b>only</b> thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E

According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva recalled Molotov's wife telling her: [...] "Your father was a genius.

500|$|A second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A {{constitutional}} amendment effecting greater reforms was voted on and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major {{opposition in the}} Senate. Diogo Antônio Feijó and Aureliano Coutinho, both Moderates, planned a coup d'état. Feijó would assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the {{constitutional amendment}}, thus bypassing the Senate entirely. Honório Hermeto called on his fellow deputies to uphold the Constitution: [...] "We need not hurt the legal order and [...] principles: we can make fair laws ... and in the respected Constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation what it wants... let us not violate it , as it is <b>our</b> <b>only</b> safeguard." [...] He rallied the deputies to his view, and in defeating the unconstitutional proposal, the coup attempt was crushed.|$|E
500|$|Folie à deux {{is a rare}} {{psychiatric}} syndrome {{in which}} symptoms of a delusional belief are transmitted from one individual to another. The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie à trois, folie à quatre, folie en famille or even folie à plusieurs ("madness of many"). Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as dependency psychotic disorder or induced delusional disorder, although the research literature largely uses the original name. The disorder was first conceptualized in 19th century French psychiatry. In keeping with the record's socially aware nature, the band felt that the term was relevant to the candidates in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Stump further clarified the title's meaning: [...] "The irony is that people will probably mistake the title as something about romantic relationships in some way.

After Brown reportedly cut off much of his wife's financial support, she filed a second divorce petition in 1997, this time in Broward County, Florida where her husband was living at the time. After a brief legal fight over whether the proceedings should take place in Kentucky or Florida, the divorce became final in 1998. Later that year, he married former Mrs. Kentucky Jill Louise Roach, 27 years his junior, but they divorced in 2003 for reasons not released. When asked why they divorced he stated [...] "I do have great love for Jill, but something which cannot be overlooked has come up in our marriage.
