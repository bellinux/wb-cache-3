5|$|Military clashes {{continued}} in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Yangtze. The Jin {{had discovered that}} southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. They signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same and the Song continued to pay annual indemnities to the Jin, but the Song no longer recognized their state as a Jin vassal.|$|E

5|$|Houston offered Bowie a {{commission}} {{as an officer}} on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining {{that he wanted to}} be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo. The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused {{a shift of}} emphasis {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of King of Pop, Jackson issued the double-disc album Thriller 25, a 25th anniversary edition of Thriller. It was a {{commercial}} success, having done particularly well as a re-issue, peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe. It reached number two in the US, number three in the UK and top10 on over 30 national charts. In the US, Thriller25 was just 14,000 copies short <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> peak position, selling 166,000copies. It was ineligible for the Billboard200 chart as a re-release, but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart, where it stayed for 10 non-consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} that the convoy sail north to {{rendezvous}} at Lord Howe Island, then set a course broadly parallel to the Great Barrier Reef with the aim <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Dutch port of Batavia. From there the convoy would sail west through the Sunda Straits to the Cape of Good Hope, then north through the Atlantic to England. This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James Cook in his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771, and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe. Shortland estimated the voyage would take the convoy between six and ten months.|$|E

5|$|At 09:00 Linois {{was still}} only observing the convoy, {{reluctant}} to attack {{until he could}} be sure {{of the nature of}} his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about, so that they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—Royal George—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The Royal George and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman Ganges, Dance's Earl Camden, the Warley and the Alfred, all returned fire, Ganges initially attacking Royal George in error. Captain James Prendergrass in Hope, the next in line, was so eager to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with Warley, the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.|$|E
5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as {{the chorus}} of soldiers and adventurers sing about the joy <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother. Due to his fighting prowess, Nantaquas thinks he is a god, but Smith explains he is only a trained warrior from across the sea. The Indians capture Smith {{to bring him to}} their chief. Back at the Powhatan River, Robin attempts to seduce Alice, but is foiled by Walter and Larry. When Walter tells the group about Smith’s capture, they depart to go after him. Before they leave, Rolfe tries to convince Percy to move on after his lover, Geraldine, apparently was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Spanish side Rayo Vallecano {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the quarter-finals. Alavés won the first leg at home 3–0. Rayo took a 2–0 lead in the second leg at their ground the Estadio Teresa Rivero, but a late Cruyff goal ensured that Alavés would progress to the semi-finals. Their {{opposition in the}} semi-finals were German team Kaiserslautern, the first leg in Spain saw four penalties awarded. Three were awarded to Alavés and one to Kaiserslautern, all were scored and a further two goals for Alavés ensured the match finished 5–1 to Alavés. The second leg at Kaiserslautern was essentially meaningless as the German team needed to score four goals to stand a chance <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> final. It was Alavés who scored four goals, Kaiserslautern scored a consolation goal, but Alavés won the match 4–1 to progress to the final in their first season in European courtesy of a 9–2 aggregate victory.|$|E

5|$|Motivated by the {{previous}} disappointing season, UConn came back in 1999–2000 with the clear goal <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters {{had to give up}} basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27–1 record, their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home—UConn had beaten Tennessee earlier in the season in Knoxville, and this was the first year the teams met twice. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and beat Penn State in the semifinals, reaching the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71–52 for their second National Championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36–1 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's MVP.|$|E
5|$|Now {{the vanguard}} of the US Eighth Army, the British and Australians crossed the Taedong River using a sand-bag bridge at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, moving north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Chongchon River. Meanwhile, {{elements}} of US 3/187 RCT occupied Yongju. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Nielson, 1 ASHR subsequently pushed up the road until fired upon by North Korean forces in the hills to the south of the town, with snipers engaging the column as it turned west out of the river valley around 16:00. Encountering only light resistance from a small North Korean force of approximately 75 men which was then scattered by tank fire, the Argylls successfully cleared the foothills by last light on 21 October. Approaching Yongju, Coad decided to halt for the night. The Argylls subsequently sent a patrol into the town, establishing initial contact with US 3/187 RCT, marrying up with K Company which was established in a number of houses on the northern edge of Yongju and on Hill 163 immediately above their position. A strong North Korean force was believed to be nearby, however, with at least 300 men thought to remain in the town.|$|E
5|$|Pick became traffic {{development}} officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed {{that the best way to}} do so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E

5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, but that also greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
5|$|Smith left to {{take over}} at Sunderland in May 1987, and former Blackburn Rovers manager Bobby Saxton was {{appointed}} in June. Only two players were under contract {{at the time of}} Saxton's arrival; his hastily arranged squad struggled from the start of 1987–88, and only won their first match in late October 1987. York were bottom of the table for most of the season, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place. The season was statistically the club's worst in the Football League, with the fewest wins (eight), most defeats (29) and the fewest points since the three points for a win system was introduced (33). York made a poor start to 1988–89, and Saxton resigned with the club bottom of the Fourth Division in mid September 1988. Swallow took over on a caretaker basis before the former Hartlepool United manager John Bird was appointed in October 1988. York's away form improved {{in the second half of}} the season, and in the last week they had a slim chance <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> play-offs. They missed out on a play-off place and finished the season in 11th place. A record loss of £190,000 was posted for the season, but the club carried no overdraft because of interest-free loans from directors and a £100,000 share issue. York started 1989–90 strongly and were in third place by mid December 1989. Successive home defeats in late December 1989 marked the start of a decline that saw them finish the season 13th in the table.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resigned}} as England coach following the Four Nations, with Steve McNamara announced as the team's new head coach. Tomkins kept {{his place in}} the England team when they played France in a mid-season friendly, and he responded by scoring four tries on England's way to a 60–6 win, a record-equalling tally for an England player in a single match. Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches at the 2010 Four Nations, firstly in a defeat by New Zealand where a Kevin Brown try scored from a Tomkins kick was disallowed by the video referee due to Tomkins pushing Greg Eastwood in the process. Another comprehensive defeat by Australia ended England's hopes <b>of</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> final, in a match where Tomkins made his first international switch from the halves to fullback. He stayed in this position for England's final match against Papua New Guinea, a 36–10 victory in which Tony Clubb equalled Tomkins' four-try record.|$|E
