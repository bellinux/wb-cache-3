40|$|Background: Rodent borne viruses of the <b>Orthohantavirus</b> genus cause {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} among people in Eurasia, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. At present, {{there are no}} specific treatments or efficient vaccines against these diseases. Improved understanding of viral transcription and replication may instigate targeted treatment of <b>Orthohantavirus</b> infections. For this purpose, we investigated the kinetics and levels of viral RNA transcription during an ongoing infection in-vitro. Methods: Vero E 6 cells were infected with Puumala <b>Orthohantavirus</b> (strain Kazan) before cells and supernatants were collected at different time points post infection {{for the detection of}} viral RNAs. A plasmid containing primer binding sites of the three <b>Orthohantavirus</b> segments small (S), medium (M) and large (L) was constructed and standard curves were generated to calculate the copy numbers of the individual transcripts in the collected samples. Results: Our results indicated a rapid increase in the copy number of viral RNAs after 9 h post infection. At peak days, 2 - 6 days after infection, the S- and M-segment transcripts became thousand and hundred-fold more abundant than the copy number of the L-segment RNA, respectively. The presence of viral RNA in the cell culture media was detected at later time-points. Conclusions: We have developed a method to follow RNA transcription in-vitro after synchronous infection of Vero cells. The obtained results may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} viral replication, and may have implications in the development of antiviral drugs targeting transcription or replication of negative stranded RNA viruses...|$|E
