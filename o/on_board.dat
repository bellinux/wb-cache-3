Curs acdèmic 2015 - 2016 The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of {{institutional}} directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> <b>on</b> CEO compensation. Concretely, we investigate the influence of institutional directors as a whole group, differentiating them into institutional directors with business ties with the business where they sit <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> (pressure-sensitive directors) and into institutional directors without business relationships (pressure-resistant directors). We hypothesise that there is a positive or negative association between institutional, pressure- sensitive and pressure-resistant directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and CEO compensation, respectively. Our results give evidence that CEO compensation decrease with a higher presence <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> of institutional directors and pressure-resistant directors, while pressure-sensitive directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> do not affect. Consequently, these conclusions support the idea that institutional directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> cannot be considered a homogeneous group and so, they play an important role in management control and payment regulations...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelors’ thesis compares {{theoretical}} {{arguments for}} women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and in management with practitioners’ argumentations for women <b>on</b> <b>boards.</b> By analyzing 32 {{responses to the}} EU Commission public consultation for women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> with argument analysis, the study assesses how theoretical models fit the debate in society. The analysis shows that the arguments go ‘outside the theoretical box’ when discussing women’s participation in the labour market. The theoretical models {{does not include the}} effect of the actors’ willingness not only to argue, but to act, in their framework on how to increase the share of women <b>on</b> <b>boards.</b> The thesis therefore concludes that the theoretical frameworks tested need to include perspectives from other areas in order to fully encompass the debate <b>on</b> women <b>on</b> <b>boards...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>On</b> <b>boarding,</b> {{also known}} as {{organizational}} socialization, plays {{a vital role in}} building the initial relationship between an organization and an employee. It also contributes to an employees’ satisfaction, better performance and greater organizational commitment thus increasing an employees’ effectiveness and productivity in his/her role. Therefore, it is essential that <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process of an organization is efficient and effective to improve new employees’ retention. Generally this <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process is done manually which is time consuming and monotonous. To enhance this process, the proposed solution automates the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> or joining process. It will enable HR, ADMINISTRATOR and IT to complete this process by robot which will automatically perform the actions taken to complete the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process. To complete this process direct access is given to applications, where as in automation, robot will perform all the actions taken to complete the process, which is a secured way to access applications. This will thus improve the timeframe and efficiency to complete the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> or joining process...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine what impact female institutional directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> have <b>on</b> corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors {{who may or may not}} maintain business relations with the companies <b>on</b> whose corporate <b>boards</b> they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> (11. 72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12. 71 % <b>on</b> <b>boards),</b> above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between firm performance and women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and top management positions {{in a sample of}} large Spanish firms in the period 2000 - 2004. The results of the study indicate that the percentage of women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and top management teams is much lower in industrial and technological sectors than in services. The participation of women is greater in industries that have greater percentages of women in the workforce. The relationship between women participation <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and firm performance depend on the measure of female representation and the measure of firm performance. The variation of firm performance in the period 2000 - 2004 does not explain the variation of female representation <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> and top management during that period...|$|R
