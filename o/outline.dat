5|$|Drake Doremus was {{inspired}} to make Like Crazy {{by the end of}} his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles.

The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page <b>outline</b> of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. The <b>outline</b> included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.|$|E
