40|$|Problem statement: The {{oxidation}} ditch {{system has been}} used to treat various types of wastewaters. Several types of aerators are used to supply the treatment process with oxygen. Among these devices, the disc aerator has certain advantages regarding foam generation over the brush and paddle type rotors, but the main disadvantages of this aerator is the limited <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity.</b> The main objectives of this study were to study the effects of various design parameters and system operation parameters on the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system. Approach: A bench scale {{oxidation ditch}} system equipped with a disc aerator was used to gain better understanding of the phenomena of oxygen transfer and to study the effects of hole diameter, number of holes per disc, disc thickness, disc speed, immersion depth and number of discs on the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system. The unsteady state method with sulphite oxidation was used to deoxygenate the water. The test involved chemical removal of dissolved oxygen from water followed by oxygenation. The power consumed was measured, the oxygen transfer coefficient was determined and both the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> and oxygenation efficiency were calculated. Results: The oxygen transfer coefficient was affected by the immersion depth, hole diameter, disc speed, disc thickness and number of discs, with the disc speed having the greatest effect. The results showed that three physical processes simultaneously contributed to oxygen transfer by the disc aerator: bubble aeration, eddy aeration and surface aeration. Conclusion: The use of sodium sulphite with cobalt chloride for deoxygenation of the water via the oxidation ditch was effective and the results were very consistent and repeatable. The aerator disc of 2. 55 cm thickness, 1. 92 cm diameter and 48 holes was found to achieve the highest <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity.</b> The system is anticipated to provide a broad range of oxygen transfer rates under actual conditions (23 - 164 mgO 2 /L-h) to meet varying process demands encountered in aerobic treatment systems. </P...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveOptimal {{preservation}} of postischemic graft function {{is essential in}} lung transplantation. Antegrade flush perfusion with modified Euro-Collins solution represents the standard technique worldwide. However, growing evidence suggests the superiority of extracellular-type Perfadex solution (Vitrolife AB, Gothenburg, Germany) over Euro-Collins solution. During ischemia and reperfusion, endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide synthesis is decreased, and therefore therapeutic stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway might be beneficial in ameliorating ischemia-reperfusion damage. However, research mainly focuses on nitric oxide supplementation of intracellular solutions, and no studies exist in which the effect of nitroglycerin on Perfadex preservation quality is evaluated. MethodsEight rat lungs each were preserved with Perfadex solution with or without nitroglycerin (0. 1 mg/mL) and compared with low-potassium Euro-Collins solution. Postischemic lungs were reventilated and reperfused, and <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity,</b> pulmonary vascular resistance, and peak inspiratory pressures were monitored continuously. Stereological analysis was used for evaluation of pulmonary edema and assessment of the vasculature. Statistics were performed by using different analysis of variance models. ResultsThe <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Perfadex-preserved groups was higher {{compared with that of}} the low-potassium Euro-Collins solution group (P <. 03). By using nitroglycerin, flush-perfusion time was reduced, and Perfadex solution with nitroglycerin–protected lungs showed superior <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> compared with that seen in Perfadex solution–protected organs (P <. 01). Furthermore, pulmonary vascular resistance and peak inspiratory pressures were improved in the nitroglycerin group (P <. 01). Stereology revealed comparable intrapulmonary edema between groups and a trend toward less vasoconstricted vasculature in Perfadex with nitroglycerin–protected lungs. ConclusionsPerfadex solution provides superior lung preservation in terms of postischemic <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> than Euro-Collins solution. Supplementation of the nitric oxide pathway by nitroglycerin further enhances functional outcome of Perfadex-preserved organs and might be an easily applicable tool in clinical lung transplantation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Wetlands are {{the largest}} natural source of methane to the atmosphere, but factors {{controlling}} methane emissions from wetlands are {{a major source of}} uncertainty in greenhouse gas budgets and projections of future climate change. We conducted a controlled outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess the effects of plant community structure (functional group richness and composition) on potential methane production and potential iron reduction in freshwater emergent marshes. Four plant functional groups (facultative annuals, obligate annuals, reeds, and tussocks) were arranged in a full-factorial design and additional mesocosms were assigned as no-plant controls. Soil samples from the top 10 cm were collected three times during the growing season to determine potential methane production and potential iron reduction (in unamended soils and in soils amended with 200 mM formate). These data were compared to soil organic matter, soil pH, and previously published data on above and belowground plant biomass. We found that functional group richness was less important than the presence of specific functional groups (reeds or tussocks) in mediating potential iron reduction. In our mesocosms, where oxidized iron was abundant and electron donors were limiting, iron reducing bacteria outcompeted methanogens, keeping methane production barely detectable in unamended lab incubations. When the possibility of re-oxidizing iron was eliminated via anaerobic incubations and the electron donor limitation was removed by adding formate, potential methane production increased and followed the same patterns as potential iron reduction. Our findings suggest that in the absence of abundant oxidized iron and/or the presence of abundant electron donors, wetlands dominated by either reeds or tussocks may have increased methane production compared to wetlands dominated by annuals. Depending on functional traits such as plant transport and rhizospheric <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacities,</b> this could potentially lead to increased methane emissions in some wetlands. Additional research examining the role these plant functional groups play in other aspects of methane dynamics will be useful given the importance of methane as a greenhouse gas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe self-inducing {{turbines}} {{are among}} mobile agitations which present {{a very interesting}} potential in terms {{of energy in the}} field of wastewater treatment by activated sludge. Often, the reactions involved in this type of contactors are limited by the gas-liquid mass transfer. The objective of this experimental work is the determination of the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of a new self-inducing turbine, a holed hollow cylinder, having a thickness of W = 1. 5 cm and a diameter D = 9 cm, with 6 holes having a diameter of 0. 5 cm each. During this experimental work, we evaluated the volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L) a, which {{is directly related to the}} <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> (OC) and this for various rotational speeds of the turbine as well as for various submergences. We finally succeeded to find an empirical correlation for our new self inducing turbine. The most common method used to estimate experimentally the coefficient k(L) a is the technique of dynamic oxygenation and deoxygenation. We finally concluded that this new turbine had a satisfying aeration capacity, which increases with the increase of the rotational speed, and decreases when increasing the submergence of the impeller.

40|$|Objective: We have {{previously}} described placental <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> as {{an index of}} placental function. The {{aim of this study}} was to utilize this test to evaluate placental gas exchange capacity in pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Study design: Two nested case-control studies were conducted between: (i) pre-eclamptic appropriate-for-gestational-age fetus (AGA) and non-pre-eclamptic AGA; and (ii) pre-eclamptic FGR and non-pre-eclamptic FGR based on gestational age match. Umbilical A-V gas differences were compared between groups. Results: Pre-eclamptic AGA was associated with smaller A-V pO 2 and A-V pCO 2 differences compared to non-pre-eclampsia (A-V pO 2, 7. 1 ± 3. 8  mm Hg vs. 11. 3 ± 5. 9  mm Hg, P= 0. 001; A-V pCO 2, 7. 8 ± 5. 7  mm Hg vs. 10. 7 ± 5. 9  mm Hg, P= 0. 01). Pre-eclamptic FGR was associated with smaller A-V pO 2 and A-V pCO 2 differences compared to non-pre-eclampsia (A-V pO 2, 6. 6 ± 3. 1  mm Hg vs. 10. 8 ± 8. 1  mm Hg, P&# 60; 0. 001; 6. 7 ± 4. 5  mm Hg vs. 10. 9 ± 10. 3  mm Hg, P= 0. 044).

40|$|Introduction. Only about 15 % of the {{potential}} candidates for lung donation are considered suitable for transplantation. A new method for ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) {{can be used to}} evaluate and recondition ""marginal,"" nonacceptable lungs. We have herein described an initial experience with ex vivo perfusion of 8 donor lungs deemed nonacceptable. Materials and Methods. After harvesting, the lungs were perfused ex vivo with Steen Solution, an extracellular matrix with high colloid osmotic pressure. A membrane oxygenator connected to the circuit received gas from a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, maintaining a normal mixed venous blood gas level in the perfusate. The lungs were gradually rewarmed, reperfused, and ventilated for evaluation through analyses of <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity,</b> pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), lung compliance (LC), and biopsy. Results. The arterial oxygen pressure (with inspired oxygen fraction of 100 %) increased from a mean of 206 mm Hg in the organ donor at the referring hospital to a mean of 498 mm Hg during the ex vivo evaluation. After 1 hour of EVLP, PVR varied from 440 - 1454 dynes/sec/cm(5); LC was in the range of 26 - 90 mL/cmH(2) O. There was no histological deterioration after 10 hours of cold ischemia and 1 hour of EVLP. Conclusions. The ex vivo evaluation model can improve <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of ""marginal"" lungs rejected for transplantation. It has great potential to increase lung donor availability and, possibly, reduce time on the waiting list.

30|$|In cancer therapy, {{radiotherapy}} {{is preferred}} to surgical resection {{because it is}} non-invasive, allowing organ structures and functions to remain intact. Radiotherapy damages the DNA of cancerous cells by direct or indirect ionization of the atoms {{that make up the}} DNA chain. However, tumor responses to radiation vary with repair <b>capacity,</b> <b>oxygenation,</b> and other factors, and side effects in normal tissues increase with the higher doses used to kill radio-resistant tumor cells Peters et al. (1982). To increase the sensitivity of the tumor site alone, many potential radiosensitizers have been studied (Rotman et al. 1998). The mechanism of most radiosensitizers, except oxygen or nitric oxide, involves inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, and cell signaling, eventually inducing apoptosis in treated cells. To control and limit irradiation to tumor cells, sparing normal cells, it is important to develop methods to enhance dosing precision.|$|R
40|$|Six {{sessions}} of high-intensity interval training (HIT) are sufficient to improve exercise capacity. The mechanisms explaining such improvements are unclear. Accordingly, {{the aim of}} this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of physiologically relevant adaptations occurring after 6 {{sessions of}} HIT to determine the mechanisms explaining improvements in exercise performance. Sixteen untrained (43 ± 6 ml kg(- 1) min(- 1)) subjects completed 6 sessions of repeated (8 - 12) 60 s intervals of high-intensity cycling (100 % peak power output elicited during incremental maximal exercise test) intermixed with 75 s of recovery cycling at a low intensity (30 W) over a 2 -week period. Potential training-induced alterations in skeletal muscle respiratory capacity, mitochondrial content, skeletal muscle <b>oxygenation,</b> cardiac <b>capacity,</b> blood volumes, and peripheral fatigue resistance were all assessed prior to and again following training. Maximal measures of oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak; ~ 8 %; p = 0. 026) and cycling time to complete a set amount of work (~ 5 %; p = 0. 008) improved. Skeletal muscle respiratory capacities increased, most likely as a result of an expansion of skeletal muscle mitochondria (~ 20 %, p = 0. 026), as assessed by cytochrome c oxidase activity. Skeletal muscle deoxygenation also increased while maximal cardiac output, total hemoglobin, plasma volume, total blood volume, and relative measures of peripheral fatigue resistance were all unaltered with training. These results suggest that increases in mitochondrial content following 6 HIT sessions may facilitate improvements in respiratory capacity, oxygen extraction, and ultimately are responsible for the improvements in maximal whole-body exercise capacity and endurance performance in previously untrained individuals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Systemic {{inhibition}} of serum CD 26 /dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP IV) enzymatic activity abrogated acute rejection of pulmonary allografts, whereas organ-specific inhibition ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion injury in syngeneic transplants. Here, we analyze {{the effect of}} allograft-specific inhibitor preconditioning on acute rejection {{in the presence of}} cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: Orthotopic left single lung transplantation (Tx) in rats (LBNF 1 to LEWIS). Control (n= 5) grafts were flushed with Perfadex alone, whereas treated (n= 5) transplants were perfused with Perfadex and AB 192, a specific inhibitor of CD 26 /DPP IV enzymatic activity. All recipients were treated with 2. 5 mg of cyclosporine A/kg per day subcutaneously after Tx. Recipients were sacrificed at day 5 after Tx, and <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> was measured. In addition, staining for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at explantation (VIP) and at day 5 (VIP, PCNA) was performed with determination of protein levels for PCNA and mRNA for VIP. RESULTS: Grafts from treated versus controls showed significantly increased <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> (P<. 008), correlating with significantly less acute rejection (P<. 02). PCNA staining and protein expression were significantly lower in perivascular and bronchial epithelial cells (P=. 001) in treated versus controls. There was significantly higher staining for VIP at the time of Tx in alveolar macrophages in treated versus controls (P=. 001), which was seen up to day 5 post-Tx in both macrophages and respiratory epithelium (P=. 001) with elevated mRNA expression for VIP in treated animals. CONCLUSION: Perfusion with a specific inhibitor of CD 26 /DPP IV enzymatic activity was associated with sustained preservation of pulmonary VIP levels, correlating with an amelioration of the acute rejection cascade...|$|E

RESULTS: After the induction of ARDS, surfactant instillation improved <b>oxygenation,</b> total lung <b>capacity</b> (TLC(35)), volume at 5 cm H(2) O end-expiration (V(5)) and Gruenwald index. The effects of Visipaque and Gastrografin were comparable with those of surfactant alone from 90 min onwards and at 120 min, respectively. Surfactant suspended in the other contrast media resulted in significantly lower values in the above-mentioned parameters. Surface tension was lowest in surfactant suspended in saline alone. Surfactant suspended in Visipaque and Gastrografin had lower surface tension compared with surfactant suspended in the other contrast media.

40|$|In recent years, {{breakpoints}} (Bp) {{of muscle}} oxygenation have been measured in local muscles using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess (predict) systemic aerobic capacity indices [lactate threshold (LT), gas exchange threshold (GET) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) ]. We investigated muscular {{differences in the}} assessment (predictive) ability of the Bp of muscle <b>oxygenation</b> for aerobic <b>capacity</b> indices during incremental cycling exercise on the aerobic capacity indices. Thirty-one active college students were recruited for an incremental cycling exercise test, during which NIRS muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), blood lactate concentration and cardiopulmonary variables were measured simultaneously in a multi-modality approach. A linear regression model was used to analyse {{the relationship between the}} Bp of the muscle oxygenation index (OI) and the systemic aerobic capacity indices. The Bp of the muscle OI in both the VL (BpVL) and GL (BpGL) were significantly correlated with the aerobic capacity indices. Additionally, the BpVL had a better goodness-of-fit [higher coefficient of determination (R 2, p < 0. 001) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE, p < 0. 03) ] in the linear regressions and occurred earlier than the BpGL.

40|$|During exercise: the Kety-Schmidt-determined {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (CBF) does not change because the jugular vein is collapsed in the upright position. In contrast, when CBF is evaluated by (133) Xe clearance, by flow in the internal carotid artery, or by flow velocity in basal cerebral arteries, a approximately 25 % increase is detected with a parallel increase in metabolism. During activation, an increase in cerebral O(2) supply is required {{because there is no}} capillary recruitment within the brain and increased metabolism becomes dependent on an enhanced gradient for oxygen diffusion. During maximal whole body exercise, however, cerebral oxygenation decreases because of eventual arterial desaturation and marked hyperventilation-related hypocapnia of consequence for CBF. Reduced cerebral oxygenation affects recruitment of motor units, and supplemental O(2) enhances cerebral <b>oxygenation</b> and work <b>capacity</b> without effects on muscle oxygenation. Also, the work of breathing and the increasing temperature of the brain during exercise are of importance for the development of so-called central fatigue. During prolonged exercise, the perceived exertion is related to accumulation of ammonia in the brain, and data support the theory that glycogen depletion in astrocytes limits the ability of the brain to accelerate its metabolism during activation. The release of interleukin- 6 from the brain when exercise is prolonged may represent a signaling pathway in matching the metabolic response of the brain. Preliminary data suggest a coupling between the circulatory and metabolic perturbations in the brain during strenuous exercise and the ability of the brain to access slow-twitch muscle fiber population...|$|R

The average body weight was 14. 1 (+/- 5) kg, body surface 0. 6 (+/- 0. 2) m(2) and a mean age 3. 8 (+/- 1. 5) months. All of them were submitted to extracorporeal circulation (CEC) with evaluation at 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. The following values were obtained: values of oxygen transference (TTO(2)) and carbon dioxide transference (TTCO(2)), haemoglobin (HBS) and free haemoglobin (HBL), the score of platelets and of leucocytes, and heat transference rate.

40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is {{a potential}} lethal disease. At present time no evidence based intervention reduces mortality. The pathophysiology of ARDS include intraalveolar fibrin deposition, hyperinflammation and reduced cellular host defense in the airspace. The normal lung activates protein C (PC) to activated protein C (APC), {{in contrast to the}} ARDS lung where the PC-APC axis is disrupted. The lungs have targets for inhaled APC as illustrated by a patient case with ARDS, unresponsive to conventional therapy.

40|$|To {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} effect of the “SKIM” mechanical foam fractionator on suspended material and the nutrient levels in prawn farm effluent, a series of standardised short-term treatments were applied to various effluent types in a static 10, 000 -litre water body. Prawn pond effluents were characterised by watercolour and dominance of phytoplankton species. Three effluent types were tested, namely 1) particulate-rich effluent with little apparent phytoplankton, 2) green mircoalgal bloom predominately made up of single celled phytoplankton, and 3) brown microalgal bloom with higher prevalence of diatoms. The effluent types were similar (P> 0. 05) in non-volatile particulate material, and nitrate/nitrite but varied from each other in the following ways: 1) The particulate-rich effluents were lower (P< 0. 05) in volatile solids (compared to brown blooms), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus and chlorophyll a (compared to both green and brown blooms). 2) The brown blooms were higher (P< 0. 05) in ammonia (compared to green blooms), total nitrogen and total phosphorus (compared to both green and particulate-rich effluent), but were lower (P< 0. 05) in inorganic phosphorus (compared to both green and particulate-rich effluent). 3) The green blooms were higher (P< 0. 05) in dissolved (both organic and inorganic) phosphorus (compared to both brown and particulate-rich effluents). Although the effluent types varied significantly in these aspects {{the effect of}} the Skim treatment was similar for all parameters measured except total phosphorus. Bloom type and Skim-treatment period significantly (P< 0. 05) affected total Kjeldahl phosphorus concentrations. For all effluent types there was a continuous significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in total Kjeldahl phosphorus during the initial 6 -hour treatment period. Levels of total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids in all effluent types were significantly (P 0. 05) affected by the Skim unit in any bloom type during the initial 6 hours of testing. Nevertheless, non-significant nitrogen reductions did occur. Foam production by the Skim unit varied with different blooms, resulting in different concentrate volumes and different end points for separate experiments. Concentrate volumes were generally high for the particulate-rich and green blooms (175 – 370 litres) and low for the brown blooms (25 – 80 litres). This was due to the low tendency of the brown bloom to produce foam. This generated higher nutrient concentrations in the associated condensed foam, but may have limited the treatment efficiency. The results suggest that in this application, the Skim unit did not remove micro-algae as effectively as was anticipated. However, it was effective at removing other suspended solids.

40|$|Background: Sildenafil, a short-acting phosphodiesterase- 5 {{inhibitor}} (1), is {{safe and}} may benefit patients with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (2 – 8). However, it requires many daily administrations. We describe a patient with end-stage primary pulmonary arterial hypertension who improved while taking tadalafil, a long-acting phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor (9). Case Report: A 72 -year-old woman was hospitalized for progressive cardiopulmonary failure. Five years earlier, primary pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed and the patient was hospitalized for hydropic decompensation and hypoxemia. Since then, she had been receiving permanent oxygen therapy and had also taken digoxin, amlodipine, furosemide, potassium canrenoate, and acenocoumarol. At the most recent hospitalization, the patient had dyspnea (New York Heart Association class IV) and 4 pitting edema of the legs up to the thighs, which had progressed over the previous 3 months. The patient’s blood pressure was 110 / 70 mm Hg, her pulse was 102 beats/min, her respiratory frequency was 32 breaths/min, and her temperature was 36. 8 °C. During oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 35 %), arterial PO 2 was 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm and right ventricular hypertrophy. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly without signs of pulmonary edema. Doppler echocardiography showed dilation of right chambers with severe tricuspidal regurgitation and estimated peak systolic pulmonary pressure of 105 mm Hg. Chest spiral computed tomography excluded pulmonary arterial embolism. Despite administration of intravenous diuretics and optimization of oxygen therapy, the patient’s condition did not substantially improve. Epoprostenol therapy was attempted but was stopped because the patient had symptomatic arterial hypotension despite a low infusion rate. Therefore, with the patient’s informed consent, we administered tadalafil (20 mg orally every other day) in addition to background therapy. After 2 weeks of tadalafil therapy, the patient improved remarkably (New York Heart Association class III); the only untoward effect was slight arterial hypotension that promptly regressed with amlodipine withdrawal. Blood pressure was 116 / 66 mm Hg, pulse rate was 84 beats/min, and respiratory frequency was 20 breaths/min. Leg edema was remarkably reduced. The patient’s arterial PO 2 was 70 mm Hg during oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0. 28 %). Doppler echocardiography showed a notable reduction of the estimated peak systolic pulmonary pressure (80 mm Hg). Accordingly, doses of intravenous diuretics were progressively decreased and were administered orally. The patient was discharged and referred to outpatient care. After 6 months of tadalafil treatment, the patient’s functional status improved (New York Heart Association class II to III). Physical examination showed stable normotension, further reduction of heart rate and respiratory frequency, and disappearance of leg edema. Arterial PO 2 during oxygen therapy (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0. 24 %) remained stably above 70 mm Hg.

Through this mechanism, it reduces mean pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary- to-systemic vascular resistance ratio and improves the overall ventilation–perfusion mismatch, arterial <b>oxygenation,</b> and functional <b>capacity</b> (3 – 8). However, {{because it has a}} half-life of about 4 hours (1), sildenafil requires many daily administrations, which in the long term may compromise treatment adherence and may be costly. In our patient with end-stage primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, we observed that long-term treatment with tadalafil, which has a half-life of about 18 hours, was safe and greatly improved pulmonary hemodynamics and arterial oxygenation (Figure). These improvements were paralleled by a striking improvement in clinical and functional status. Besides confirming the efficacy of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors in treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, this finding may alert physicians to the possibility that tadalafil may be more affordable than sildenafil. In fact, because its half-life is nearly 5 -fold greater than sildenafil’s (9), tadalafil may be administered once daily or even every second day, a feature that may improve adherence and reduce treatment costs...|$|R
40|$|Haematological {{analyses}} were conducted in gynogenetic diploids and control diploids of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). Gynogenetic diploid fish were obtained from Polish aquaculture after induction of meiotic gynogenesis based on application of UV-irradiated hybrid Siberian sturgeon × Russian sturgeon (A. gueldenstaedtii) sperm (for eggs activation) and heat shock for inhibiting the second polar body retention. A total of fifteen 30 -month-old specimens of Siberian sturgeon from the gynogenetic diploid group and 12 specimens from the control diploid group were randomly sampled. There were no differences {{in the number of}} erythrocytes and haematocrit values between gynogenetic diploids and normal diploids of Siberian sturgeon. However, the percentage of normal erythrocytes was lower in the gynogenetic group of fish and the higher percentage of the atypical red blood cell forms (microcytes, sphaerocytes, erythrocytes with displaced nuclei and with divided nuclei) were observed in this group of fish. Additionally all the haemoglobin indices (haemoglobin concentration, the mean corpuscular haemoglobin and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration) were significantly reduced in gynogenetic diploids of Siberian sturgeon. These results could suggest depletion of <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the blood of gynogenetic sturgeons. Thi...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} organ preservation, surgical techniques and perioperative care, primary graft dysfunction {{is a serious}} medical problem in transplantation medicine in general and a specific problem in patients undergoing lung transplantation.

We assessed {{the effect of a}} cingulin-derived peptide, XIB 13 or a random peptide in an established rat model of allogeneic lung transplantation. Donor lungs and recipients received therapeutic peptide at the time of transplantation and outcome was analyzed 100 min and 28 days post grafting.

Moreover, the induction of an allogeneic T cell response was delayed indicating a reduced antigen exchange between the donor and the host.

40|$|A 20 -l {{packed-bed}} reactor {{filled with}} foamed glass beads was {{tested for the}} treatment of acetonitrile HPLC wastes. Aeration was provided by recirculating a portion of the reactor liquid phase through an aeration tank, where the dissolved oxygen concentration was kept at 6 mg/l. At a feeding rate of 0. 77 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1, 99 % of the acetonitrile was removed; and 86 % of the nitrogen present in acetonitrile was released as NH 3, confirming that acetonitrile volatilization was not significant. Increasing the acetonitrile loading resulted in lower removal efficiencies, but a maximum removal capacity of 1. 0 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1 was achieved at a feeding rate of 1. 6 g acetonitrile l– 1 reactor day– 1. The removal capacity of the system was well correlated with the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity,</b> showing that acetonitrile removal was likely to be limited by oxygen supply. Microbial characterization of the biofilm resulted in the isolation of a Comamonas sp. able to mineralize acetonitrile as sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source.

A control column photobioreactor with suspended algal-bacterial biomass was also tested to compare the performance of biofilm photobioreactors with conventional algal-based processes. When the algal-bacterial biomass was immobilized onto Poraver((R)) the process never reached a steady state due to a poor homogenization in the bioreactor. When the biofilm was formed onto the reactor wall (or reactor base) the process was stable. A maximum degradation rate of 295 mg BODl(- 1) h(- 1) was achieved in the algal-turf reactor although control experiments performed in the dark showed atmospheric O(2) diffusion represented 55 % of the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> in this system.

40|$|Installing {{membranes}} for solid-liquid separation into BNR {{activated sludge}} (AS) systems makes a profound difference {{not only to}} the design of the BNR system itself but also to the design approach for the whole WWTP. The PWWF fixes the membrane surface area that is required in the aerobic zone and therefore fixes the aerobic zone volume. This in turn fixes the biological reactor volume because the aerobic mass fraction is generally fixed to ensure nitrification and sufficient anaerobic and/or anoxic mass fractions for N and/or P removal. Therefore usually with MBR BNR systems, the reactor volume is fixed by the PWWF. The sludge age is then calculated in order to achieve the required Xtaer for effective membrane operation (12 to 18 g/ℓ). For low aerobic mass fraction (< 60 %) MBR BNR systems without flow balancing treating settled wastewater, the sludge age to achieve the required Xtaer is extremely long and the membrane aeration system supplies significantly more oxygen than required for the peak total biological oxygen demand, resulting in uneconomical operation. Treating raw wastewater for this situation results in much shorter sludge ages and in much greater utilization of the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the membrane aeration system. Therefore for PWWF/ADWF ratios in the upper range (2. 0 - 2. 5), aerobi...|$|E
40|$|Several {{levels of}} {{complexity}} {{are available for}} modelling of wastewater treatment plants. Modelling local effects rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches whereas activated sludge models (ASM) represent the global methodology. By applying both modelling approaches to pilot plant and full scale systems, this paper evaluates the value of each method and especially their potential combination. Model structure identification for ASM is discussed based on a full-scale closed loop oxidation ditch modelling. It is illustrated how and for what circumstances information obtained via CFD (computational fluid dynamics) analysis, residence time distribution (RTD) and other experimental means can be used. Furthermore, CFD analysis of the multiphase flow mechanisms is employed to obtain a correct description of the <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system studied, including an easy implementation of this information in the classical ASM modelling (e. g. oxygen transfer). The combination of CFD and activated sludge modelling of wastewater treatment processes is applied to three reactor configurations, a perfectly mixed reactor, a pilot scale activated sludge basin (ASB) and a real scale ASB. The application of the biological models to the CFD model is validated against experimentation for the pilot scale ASB and against a classical global ASM model response.

Haematological examination of 78 specimens of three-year-old tench. consisting of 21 triploids and their 57 diploid siblings was performed in July 1996. Analysis of variance test confirmed a significantly lower erythrocyte count in triploids (P < 0. 01). {{as well as a}} significantly lower haemoglobin content (P < 0. 05), significantly higher medium corpuscular volume. higher medium corpuscular haemoglobin and lower medium corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (all at P < 0. 01) compared to diploids.

The differences of erythrocyte nuclear area. perimeter. average size, major axis and aspect ratio between diploids and triploids were found signiticant at P < 0. 01 and the effect of ploidy level on these dimensions was considered highly significant (P < 0. 000 I). No effect of ploidy level was proven for erythrocyte nuclear minor axis. The leukocyte count of triploids was insignificantly lesser compared to diploids. Triploid tench were found of significantly lower concentration of total protein in blood plasma compared to diploids (P < 0. 01).

40|$|A {{consortium}} {{consisting of}} a Chlorella sorokiniana strain and a Ralstonia basilensis strain was {{able to carry out}} sodium salicylate biodegradation in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) using exclusively photosynthetic oxygenation. Salicylate biodegradation depended on algal activity, which itself was a function of microalgal concentration, light intensity, and temperature. Biomass recirculation improved the photobioreactor performance by up to 44 % but the results showed the existence of an optimal biomass concentration above which dark respiration started to occur and the process efficiency started to decline. The salicylate removal efficiency increased by a factor of 3 when illumination was increased from 50 - 300 muE/M- 2 (.) s. In addition, the removal rate of sodium salicylate was shown to be temperature-dependent, increasing from 14 to 27 mg/l(.) h when the temperature was raised from 26. 5 to 31. 5 degreesC. Under optimized conditions (300 muE/m(2) (.) s, 30 degreesC, 1 g sodium salicylate/l in the feed and biomass recirculation) sodium salicylate was removed at a maximum constant rate of 87 mg/l. h, corresponding to an estimated <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of 77 mg O- 2 /l(.) h (based on a BOD value of 0. 88 g O- 2 /g sodium salicylate for the tested bacterium), which is in the range of the oxygen transfer capacity of large-scale mechanical surface aerators. Thus, although higher degradation rates were attained in the control reactor, the photobioreactor is a cost-efficient process which reduces the cost of aeration and prevents volatilization problems associated with the degradation of toxic volatile organic compounds under aerobic conditions.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) clinically to prepare donor lungs for transplantation. Methods: A prospective study involving EVLP for the reconditioning of extended-criteria donor lungs, the criteria for which include aspects such as a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 300 mmHg. Between February of 2013 and February of 2014, the lungs of five donors were submitted to EVLP for up to 4 h each. During EVLP, respiratory mechanics were continuously evaluated. Once every hour during the procedure, samples of the perfusate were collected and {{the function of the}} lungs was evaluated. Results: The mean PaO 2 of the recovered lungs was 262. 9 ± 119. 7 mmHg at baseline, compared with 357. 0 ± 108. 5 mmHg after 3 h of EVLP. The mean <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the lungs improved slightly over the first 3 h of EVLP- 246. 1 ± 35. 1, 257. 9 ± 48. 9, and 288. 8 ± 120. 5 mmHg after 1, 2, and 3 h, respectively-without significant differences among the time points (p = 0. 508).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Donor lungs {{obtained}} after prolonged warm ischemia (WI) may be {{unsuitable for}} transplantation {{due to the}} risk of reperfusion injury, but could be reconditioned using ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Key processes of reperfusion injury include the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) /nitrogen species (RNS) and the activation of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We explored whether rat lungs obtained after WI could be reconditioned during EVLP using the ROS/RNS scavenger Mn(III) -tetrakis (4 -benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) or the PARP inhibitor 3 -aminobenzamide (3 -AB). METHODS: Rat lungs obtained after 3 hours cold ischemia (CI group, control), or 1 hour WI plus 2 hours CI (WI group) were placed in an EVLP circuit for normothermic perfusion for 3 hours. Lungs retrieved after WI were treated or not with 3 -AB (1 mg/mL) or MnTBAP (0. 3 mg/mL), added to the perfusate. Measurements included physiological variables (lung compliance, vascular resistance, <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity),</b> lung weight gain, levels of proteins, lactate dehydrogenase, protein carbonyl (marker of ROS), 3 -nitrotyrosine (marker of RNS), poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) (PAR, marker of PARP activation) and IL- 6, in the bronchoalveolar lavage or the lung tissue, and histology. RESULTS: In comparison to the CI group, the lungs from the WI group displayed higher protein carbonyls, 3 -nitrotyrosine, PAR, lactate dehydrogenase and proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage, lung weight gain, perivascular edema, as well as reduced static compliance, but similar oxygenation. All these alterations were markedly attenuated by 3 -AB and MnTBAP. CONCLUSIONS: After EVLP, lungs obtained after WI exhibit oxidative stress, PARP activation, and tissue injury, which are suppressed by pharmacological inhibitors of ROS/RNS and PARP...|$|E
40|$|Background. Only a {{minority}} of the potential candidates for lung donation are considered suitable, using current evaluation methods. A new method for ex vivo evaluation, with the potential for reconditioning of marginal and nonacceptable lungs, has been developed. This is a report of the ex vivo evaluation of six donor lungs deemed nonacceptable (arterial oxygen pressure less than 40 kPa) by the Scandiatransplant, Eurotransplant, and UK transplant organizations. Methods. The lungs are perfused ex vivo with Steen solution, a lung evaluation-preservation solution, mixed with red blood cells to a hematocrit of 15 %. This extracellular solution is designed to have an optimal colloid osmotic pressure so that physiologic pressure and flow can be maintained without development of pulmonary edema. An oxygenator connected to the extracorporeal circuit maintains a normal mixed venous blood gas level in the perfusate. The lungs are ventilated and evaluated through analyses of pulmonary vascular resistance, <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity,</b> and arterial carbon dioxide pressure minus end-tidal carbon dioxide difference. Results. The arterial oxygen pressure (inspired oxygen fraction, 1. 0) increased from 27 kPa (range, 17 to 34 kPa) in situ in the organ donor at the referring hospital to 57 kPa (range, 39 to 66 kPa) during the ex vivo evaluation. The pulmonary vascular resistance varied from 3. 2 to 5. 7 Wood units, and the arterial carbon dioxide pressure minus end-tidal carbon dioxide difference was in the range of 1 to 2. 5 kPa. Conclusions. The arterial oxygen pressure improves significantly in this model. This ex vivo evaluation model is a valuable addition to the armamentarium in finding acceptable lungs in a donor population with inferior arterial oxygen pressure values...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} effects of leukocyte and platelet depletion on postoperative lung injury in 42 patients who underwent heart operations. Blood was serially sampled before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass, and leukocyte count, platelet count, and thromboxane B 2 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, leukocyte elastase, thrombin–antithrombin III complex, and D-dimer levels were determined. Postoperative respiratory function was assessed based on analyses of oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. Leukocyte and platelet depletion was performed in 21 patients (experimental group) but not in another (control group). In the experimental group, leukocytes and platelets were removed continuously {{by means of the}} blood cell separator CS- 3000, beginning immediately after the start of the operation and ending 1 hour after the release of aortic occlusion. Leukocyte elastase, thromboxane B 2, ratio of thromboxane B 2 to 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, thrombin–antithrombin III complex, and D-dimer were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Of the various indexes of oxygenation, arterial oxygen tension was significantly higher in the experimental group and the alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference and respiratory index were significantly lower in the experimental group. The positive end-expiratory pressure needed to achieve an appropriate arterial oxygen tension was significantly lower in the experimental group. The elimination of carbon dioxide was lower in the experimental group. Depletion of leukocytes and platelets reduced respiratory dysfunction after heart operations with cardiopulmonary bypass. It was particularly effective in patients with a low preoperative <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> and in those for whom an extended period of cardiopulmonary bypass was required.

40|$|En vue d'optimiser l'aération de {{substrats}} liquides à forte charge organique dissoute, un système d'aération fonctionnant selon te principe du "cheminement prolongé" a été conçu et construit à l'échelle pilote (3 000 L). Le principe mis à l'essai consiste à injecter de l'air à la base de longs tuyaux enroulés. La dynamique hydraulique du système à cheminement prolongé a été caractérisée. Un système d'aération plus conventionnel, soit un injecteur d'air de type poreux, a été utilisé comme base de comparaison. Les performances d'oxygénation des deux systèmes ont été mesurées dans l'eau, sous les mêmes conditions, puis comparées entre elles et aux valeurs rapportées dans la littérature pour d'autres systèmes. Les principaux résultats montrent que le coefficient de transfert d'oxygène (KL. a) est bon à l'intérieur des tuyaux de l'aérateur à cheminement prolongé (jusqu'à 230 h- 1). Le nouveau prototype démontre également une forte capacité d'emprisonnement de l'air puisque le gonflement atteint 20 %. Finalement, de bonnes efficacités énergétiques ont été obtenues : des valeurs brute de 1. 9 kg O 2 /kWh et nette de 9. 2 kg O 2 /kWh ont été atteintes. Le prototype, tel que construit, a offert des performances. d'oxygénation globales similaires à cettes démontrées par l'injecteur d'air de type poreux, {{le volume}} interne des tuyaux, qui présente un intérêt particulier pour le transfert d'oxygène, ne représentant que 26 % du volume liquide total. L'optimisation de l'aérateur à cheminement prolongé passe donc par l'accroissement maximal du volume interne des tuyaux par rapport au volume liquide total. Cette mesure se traduirait par une augmentation de la capacité d'oxygénation totale et des efficacités physique et énergétique du transfert d'oxygène, ainsi que par une diminution des puissances spécifiques requises. Les performances du système à cheminement prolone dans un liquide chargé en substrat organique restent à étudier, mais les résultats préliminaires obtenus dans l'eau du robinet sont encourageants. Aeration represents the major operating cost {{in the various}} aerobic treatment processes intended for wastewaters or other effluents showing a high dissolved organic load, such as swine manure; it is therefore necessary to maximize the utilization of the oxygen provided to any treatment system. Various types of air injectors and turbines have been studied or built {{in order to achieve}} an adequate oxygenation of liquid wastes to be treated : porous and non-porous injectors, immersed and surface turbines, the latter rotating vertically or horizontally. The aeration performances of these systems appear to be variable; moreover, these systems are not always well adapted to a substrate such as swine manure. With a view to possible application to swine manure treatment, we have designed an "extended contact" pilot-scale aerator (3000 L). The strategy involved injecting air at the basal end of long coiled pipes in which the manure to be treated was circulated. The objective was to increase the time of contact between the air bubbles and the liquid and, consequently, oxygen transfer to the latter. The internal surface of the pipes was large and could become an effective physical support for microbial attachment, thus promoting further digestion. We evaluated the performance of the system with tap water and compared it with a more conventional aeration system, i. e. a porous-type injector also known as a mini-bubble diffusor. Eight oxygenation parameters were evaluated for each of the two systems oxygen transfer coefficient (KL-a), swelling (SWEL), standard <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> (SOC), specific standard <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> (SSOC), physical efficiency of oxygen transfer [ɛ, cf. Equation (1) ], power consumed (P), specific power injected (SP) and energy efficiency (E). A theoretical simulation of the performances of a hybrid system combining the two aeration principles was carried out. The hydraulic dynamics of the extended-contact system were established through the evaluation of the recirculated flows due to the aerator. The best results obtained were finally compared to those taken from the literature. The main results show the following positive aspects of the extended-contact aerator : 1 - high oxygen transfer coefficients inside the pipes; 2 - high air retention capacity; 3 - good energy efficiency for low air flows. Inside the pipes, values of 230 h- 1 were obtained for KL. a. The new prototype retained up to 546 L of air which corresponds to a swelling of 20 %. A raw energy efficiency of 1. 9 kg O 2 /kWh was obtained, and the net value (based open the net power) was 9. 2 kg O 2 /kWh. The prototype, as constructed, gave oxygenation performances globally similar to those obtained with the porous type air injector {{despite the fact that the}} internal volume of the pipes, which is of special interest for oxygen transfer, was only 26 % of the total liquid volume. The optimization of the extended-contact system therefore calls for a maximal increase of the internal volume of the pipes as compared to the total liquid volume. Ideally, the internal volume should represent 100 % of the total volume. By doing so, oxygenation performances should be improved because of : 1 - increased total <b>oxygenation</b> <b>capacity</b> due to a better overall KL. a; 2 - increased physical efficiency of oxygen transfer (ɛ) in relation to the length of the pipes (in theory, ɛ could reach 100 %); 3 - decreased injected specific power (SP); 4 - increased energy efficiency of oxygen transfer (E). With such improvements in view and considering the requirement : of the aerobic treatment of highly loaded affluents such as swine manure, the extended-contact aerator appears to be a promising aeration technique that still has, however, to be tested under practical conditions...|$|E
