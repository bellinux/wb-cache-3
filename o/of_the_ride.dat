5|$|Clones of the {{original}} ride, at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois, became a staple at Six Flags theme parks around the world, and were opened in Six Flags Great Adventure (1993), Six Flags Magic Mountain (1994), and Six Flags St. Louis (1995).

25|$|Conservative {{support is}} centred in <b>the</b> {{interior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding,</b> particularly in <b>the</b> upscale Lorne Park area, while the Liberals and the NDP {{tend to do}} better along <b>the</b> waterfront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding,</b> such as Port Credit and Lakeview, and the eastern and western edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1909 Rocky Mountain {{was formed}} from <b>the</b> western edge <b>of</b> Rosebud in <b>the</b> north part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding,</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>riding</b> <b>of</b> Banff, <b>the</b> western half <b>of</b> High River and Macleod.

5|$|For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated {{on a scale from}} 1 to 5.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady {{movement on the}} track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Six Flags Great Adventure spent $42 {{million on}} new attractions {{including}} a prototype Floorless Coaster, Medusa (later renamed Bizarro), developed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard.

5|$|In July 2006 Universal Studios Japan {{announced}} a 2007 proposed {{installation of a}} new roller coaster. Although full details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> were not announced, officials stated that $50 million would be invested in the attraction.

On 9 March 2007, after approximately eight months of construction, the park officially opened Hollywood Dream.|$|E
5|$|Montu was {{launched}} alongside Busch Gardens Tampa Bay's Egypt {{section of the}} park, which reportedly cost approximately US$20 million. With an overall theme around Egyptian mythology, the ride is named after the god of war Montu, a man depicted {{with the head of}} a hawk.

2500|$|From 1966 until 2004, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charlottetown <b>riding</b> {{was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>of</b> Hillsborough.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>riding</b> {{was divided}} between the rural and urban parts.

5|$|On July 27, 2006, a 45-year-old man {{was found}} unresponsive and not {{breathing}} on Goliath after losing consciousness during the ride.

After an inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> showed that the roller coaster was operating properly, it reopened to the public.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

50|$|Mayo was {{an electoral}} {{district}} which returned an MLA to <b>the</b> Legislative Assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yukon Territory in Canada. It {{was created in}} 1928, {{at a time when}} it was one of three districts who elected advisors to the Yukon Territorial Council. The more contemporary, final iteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> was created from an amalgamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> with part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>of</b> Klondike.

50|$|Following the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> {{was renamed}} Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix from Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord, with <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> {{becoming}} a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring <b>riding</b> <b>of</b> Manicouagan.|$|R
50|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 2004: 61.5 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> came from Laurentides, 34.9 per cent from Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, and 3.6 per cent from Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. <b>The</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> were not changed in the 2012 electoral redistribution.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Swarm {{is located}} on a {{reclaimed}} island adjacent to the Stealth roller coaster, with parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> being built over water.
