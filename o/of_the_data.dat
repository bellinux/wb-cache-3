5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E
