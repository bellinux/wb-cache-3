The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) and Barb (voiced by Susie Essman) return, bickering amongst themselves. The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away.

The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her.

5|$|Determined {{to prove}} that he can become a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world that leads to a summer camp, but he is unable to scare a cabin full of children, and runs <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Meanwhile, Roar Omega Roar offers to {{reinstate}} Sulley, but he refuses, instead confessing to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is alerted to Mike's break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley defies Hardscrabble, and enters the same door to find Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Mike realizes {{that the only way to}} escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy to return to the lab seconds before the device overloads and explodes in front of Hardscrabble.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested chloral hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: [...] "Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the screen door, wandering <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> with Hamlet ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children." [...] Several Basement Tapes songs, such as [...] "Clothes Line Saga" [...] and [...] "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.|$|E
60|$|When Godfrey woke {{he found}} that Luka was already up.

60|$|The king's chief huntsman at {{this time}} was Beorn, and Beorn soon became very envious and jealous of Lothbroc, {{on account of his}} {{superior}} power and skill, and of the honorable distinction which they procured for him. One day, when they two were hunting alone in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> with their dogs, Beorn killed his rival, and hid his body in a thicket. Beorn went home, his own dogs following him, while the greyhound remained to watch mournfully over the body of his master.

500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E

6000|$|So {{they killed}} the prince, {{and left him}} dead on the roadside. And the {{faithful}} beasts came round the dead body and wept, and wondered what they should do.

Then he called the fox, {{and told him to}} mount guard over the dead ox, and if a bird came past and tried to peck at the flesh he was to catch it and bring it to the lion. Soon after a crow flew past, and began to peck at the dead ox. In a moment the fox had caught it and brought it to the lion. Then the lion said to the crow: ...|$|R

60|$|Soon {{after the}} party had started, Hake, {{who was one of}} them, {{observed}} a female figure disappear round a copse near the shores of the lake.

60|$|The Cap didn't waste {{a moment}} in words.

On they came, and we could see El Zeres riding first, with the bloodhound trotting along by the side of his horse. Just as he was opposite we heard a loud, shrill whistle, and the Mexicans halted with a look of uneasiness. They weren't left to wonder long, for in a moment there was a trampling of horses, and down came our fellows on both sides of them. Just before they got up we stepped forward with our rifles up.|$|R

[...] Some of the loggers were as handsome and well-made as he, and were of as good origin and traditions, though he had some advantages of training. But his two-button cutaway, his well-fitting trousers, his scarf with a pin in it, had been too much for these young fellows in their long 'stoga boots and flannel shirts. They looked at him askance, and despatched their meal with more than their wonted swiftness, and were <b>off</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> without any demonstrations of satisfaction in Bartley's presence.|$|R
60|$|There {{were other}} moose on the lake, {{all of them}} as {{uncertain}} as the big cow and her calf.

If a moose smelled me before I saw him, he would make <b>off</b> quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> as all wild creatures do, and watch from a safe distance. But if I stumbled upon him unexpectedly, when the wind brought no warning to his nostrils, he was fearless, usually, and full of curiosity.|$|R

In the doorway stands the old woman, her shawl now pulled back to reveal a hideous face lit by the ghostly moonlight. As she turns to run she stumbles and falls. The old woman’s shadow falls on her as she advances, freezing her body with a paralysing chill, and her throat goes dry as she tries to scream. The girl is never seen again.|$|R
