50|$|During {{direct contact}} {{one must be}} careful because the stamp can easily be {{physically}} deformed causing printed features that {{are different from the}} <b>original</b> <b>stamp</b> features. Horizontally stretching or compressing the stamp will cause deformations in the raised and recessed features. Also, applying too much vertical pressure on the stamp during printing can cause the raised relief features to flatten against the substrate. These deformations can yield submicron features even though the <b>original</b> <b>stamp</b> has a lower resolution.|$|R

30|$|In {{a second}} step, we {{developed}} a first draft version of the instrument. This involved, first and foremost, narrowing down the number of items, since the <b>original</b> <b>STAMP</b> instrument featured considerably more items (166) than we had available in our slot of the NEPS-questionnaire (48 items). Moreover, it involved modifying some of the response scales (as described in the discussion above). And last but not least, it involved adding new items, where conceptually necessary.|$|R

50|$|One stamp was {{typically}} issued for each 6d (2½ new pence) spent on goods, so {{large numbers of}} stamps had to be stuck into the books. At a later stage, a second denomination of stamp was added, worth 10 of the <b>original</b> <b>stamps,</b> which somewhat alleviated this problem. Finally towards the end there was a single large stamp worth 40 standard stamps. This was printed with a carmine background around the traditional green shield logo.|$|R
