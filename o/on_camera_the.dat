5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E

5|$|Star Film was {{established}} by Jo Eng Sek, who had previous film experience as co-producer of Si Tjonat (1929), and Shanghai-based cameraman Cho' Chin Hsin; {{for much of the}} life of the company, Jo would take the role of producer while Cho' would be <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> company's headquarters were located at Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta). The company released its first film, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, in April 1941. For this detective film, Star signed L. V. Wijnhamer Jr., an Indo social worker popular with the ethnic Chinese community. The film was a commercial success, allowing the company to expand.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E

Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>the</b> day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E

25|$|The film makes {{repeated}} use of distinctive cinematic techniques. One {{of these}} is dreams and how they reflect the fears and desires of the characters. Another {{is the use of}} music, in conjunction with dialogues and editing, both as background music and as performed <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> film starts with a monologue which ends up being sung to Dixieland jazz music being played by lone musicians, each in a different room in {{a different part of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|Caseros {{was used}} as a place to {{dismantle}} stolen cars during the 1990s. At the time there was also a mysterious episode in which two inmates were allowed out into the street for a night to go on a robbing spree. They shot and killed someone {{in the course of the}} night, and their faces were caught <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> next morning they were safely back in their cells, but the police identified them through the videotapes and began to investigate. Within the next three weeks, one of the inmates was found dead in his cell, apparently as a result of suicide. But his fellow inmates doubted the possibility of suicide, since he hadn't shown any signs of being suicidal. The guards who had let them out for a night in exchange for a cut of the booty were obvious suspects. Eventually all the guards were arrested as a part of the investigation, and held in custody for nearly a year. One guard was tried and found guilty of murder, receiving a sentence of twenty years in prison.|$|E

25|$|The scheme {{makes use}} of {{purpose-built}} automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% accuracy rate through the technology. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> cameras take two still pictures in colour and {{black and white and}} use infrared technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an instation system developed by Roke Manor Research Ltd, which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually. Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), based in Swansea.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes {{suggested}} to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin {{in the main}} role because of his experience with the child actor while shooting Uncle Buck. Columbus met with other actors for the part, by his count [...] "hundreds and hundreds", as {{he felt it was}} his [...] "directorial responsibility". Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice for the role. Due to Culkin's age, he could only work until 10 PM which created shooting problems for the crew because of the movie's many night-time scenes. The film's stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, [...] "Every time the stunt guys did one of those stunts it wasn’t funny. We’d watch it, and I would just pray that the guys were alive." [...] Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>the</b> film's final stunts were performed without them.|$|E

When video clips of her comments about other candidates were shown on The Apprentice: You're Fired!, following up on the main programme, Hopkins explained that they were [...] "quite funny". Michelle Mone, the founder of lingerie company Ultimo and a guest on the panel, verbally attacked Hopkins, calling her [...] "exceptionally selfish", said she {{was not to be}} trusted, and accused her of giving [...] "businesswomen a bad name". Sugar was criticised over his questioning of Hopkins about her childcare arrangements. He was accused of violating the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act. The incident received substantial media comment. Sugar argued his case in an interview with GMTV host Fiona Phillips, stating that he was aware of the rules.|$|E
2500|$|Hodgson {{decided to}} leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his {{disagreements}} with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence to produce a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: [...] "If I had {{the presence of mind to}} try and work it out, I would rather have stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, it just seemed like I needed to." [...] Though they held casting calls for a replacement for Hodgson <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>the</b> crew found that none of the potential actors really fit the role; instead, having reviewed a test run that Nelson had done with the 'bots, the crew agreed that having Nelson (who had already appeared in guest roles on the show) replace Hodgson would be the least jarring approach. [...] The replacement of Joel by Mike would lead to an oft-jokingly [...] "Joel vs Mike flame war" [...] among fans, similar to the [...] "Kirk vs Picard" [...] discussions in the Star Trek fandom.|$|E
