5|$|The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous. The Sun's {{temperature}} is intermediate between that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> stars {{and that of}} the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and driest places in North America, yet {{it is home to}} over 1,000 species of plants; 23 of which, including the very rare Rock Lady (Holmgrenanthe petrophila), are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the}} more massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E

5|$|Located near Alpha is R Muscae, a Classical Cepheid {{variable}} {{ranging from}} apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037light-years away. S Muscae is likewise a Classical Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 {{over a period}} of 9.66days. A luminous star around 5.9times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5solar masses, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and brightest companions of a Cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505days.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, Sabina had {{delivered}} the libretto {{for a second}} opera, a light comedy entitled The Bartered Bride, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because {{of the success of}} The Brandenburgers, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation. The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> evenings of the year, {{on the eve of the}} Austro-Prussian War, with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.|$|E

5|$|The Wonder World Tour was commercially {{successful}} and represented {{stability in the}} touring industry, despite the financial recession. In North America, the tour sold out twenty-nine out of forty-five concert dates and grossed over US $45.2 million. The tour was able to remain as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> tours in the United States during its expansion. The Wonder World Tour's entire, ten-date European leg sold out in only ten minutes. In order to meet demand, an eleventh date was added and scheduled for December 29, 2009. In December 2009, the tour ranked atop Billboards Hot Tours, based on the tour's European performances. For the month, box office grossed US $21.9 million for eleven shows in four markets. The five concerts held at The O2 Arena in London produced ticket sales that topped $11 million (£6.8 million). On December 19, 2009, with an audience of 16,196, Cyrus broke {{the record for the}} largest attendance at The O2 Arena; a record that surpassed the previously tied records by Beyoncé's I Am...

40|$|<b>The</b> {{classical}} dynamics <b>of</b> a {{cold atom}} trapped inside a vertical rotating helical optical tube (HOT) is investigated by taking also {{into account the}} gravitational field. <b>The</b> resulting equations <b>of</b> motion are solved numerically. The rotation induces a vertical motion for an atom initially at rest. The motion is a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> two inertial forces, namely the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force. Both inertial forces force the atom to rotate in a direction opposite to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HOT.</b> <b>The</b> frequency and <b>the</b> turning points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atom's global oscillation can be controlled by the value and <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HOT.</b> However, at large values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HOT</b> <b>the</b> atom can escape from the global oscillation and be transported along <b>the</b> axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HOT.</b> In this case, <b>the</b> rotating <b>HOT</b> operates as an Optical Archimedes' Screw (OAS) for atoms...|$|R
