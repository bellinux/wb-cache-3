5|$|The {{amount of}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid varies by size and species. In humans and other mammals, cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed {{in a similar}} manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of 3–5 times a day. Problems with CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of {{three to four times}} a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E

In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town {{to explain why the}} Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E

He took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> difficult time for the club, who had flirted with relegation for several of the previous seasons prior to his arrival. However, the stability brought was balanced by a lack of genuine success, with a poor away record at the top sides, a mediocre record when competing in European competition and no silverware in any of the 11 seasons he was in charge.|$|E

When they refused to release the information, Xuân killed them with his pistol. An investigation by Đôn later determined Nghĩa shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife without realizing that both the brothers had already been killed by Xuân.|$|E

25|$|Late August {{saw one of}} {{the largest}} {{operations}} by NATO forces in Helmand province, with the aim bringing electricity to the region. A convoy of 100 vehicles took five days to move massive sections of an electric turbine for the Kajaki Dam, covering 180km (112 miles). The operation involved 2,000 British troops, 1,000 other NATO troops from Australia, Canada, Denmark and the US and 1,000 Afghan soldiers. The Canadians covered the first leg and the British took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> meeting point in the desert, using 50 BVS10 Viking armoured vehicles to escort the convoy. Hundreds of special forces troops went in first, sweeping the area and although difficult to verify, British commanders estimated more than 200 insurgents were killed - without any losses or injuries to NATO soldiers. British, Dutch, French and US aircraft, helicopters and unmanned drones provided aerial reconnaissance and fire support.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had {{an affair}} with Gilbert Cannan (who was twenty years younger than her and an {{associate}} of Barrie's in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity– the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce was for him, some of Barrie's friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did. Barrie continued to support Mary financially even after she married Cannan, by giving her an annual allowance which was handed <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> private dinner held on her and Barrie's wedding anniversary.|$|E

500|$|In August 1984 the orchestra's {{managing}} director, Peter Hemmings, resigned. For {{the first}} time since 1949, the orchestra appointed one of its players to the position. Clive Gillinson, a cellist, took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bad time in the LSO's fortunes, and {{played a central role in}} turning them round. He negotiated what Morrison calls [...] "a dazzling series of mega-projects, each built around the personal enthusiasm of a 'star' conductor or soloist", producing sell-out houses.

Every building must be razed to its foundation." [...] The task of carrying out the destruction was assigned to SS-Brigadeführer Paul Otto Geibel. Subsequently, the buildings of the city were systematically reduced to ruin, one by one.|$|E

Under his directorship, Los Alamos developed an underground test containment program, completed its Meson Physics Facility, acquired the first Cray supercomputer, and trained the first class of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Agnew managed to get the Los Alamos Laboratory responsibility {{for the development of the}} W76, used by the Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, and the W78 used by the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. He was proud of the work with insensitive high explosive that made nuclear weapons safer to handle. Support from the Atomic Energy Commission for reactor development dried up, but during the [...] 1970s energy crisis, the laboratory explored other types of alternative fuels.|$|E

Beyoncé is nicknamed Honey Bee, a {{reference}} to the character Honey Bunny in Tarantino's 1994 crime film Pulp Fiction. After an exchange of dialogues, Gaga and Beyoncé travel through the desert and pull <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> diner. Beyoncé sits opposite to her boyfriend, Gibson, but becomes tired of his stupidity and poisons him, but it does not kill him like she had hoped. The video later shifts to an intermediate sequence called [...] "Let's Make a Sandwich", where Gaga stands in a kitchen, wearing a folded-up telephone on her head, while dancers cavort behind her, holding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. Ultimately, Gaga prepares a sandwich and eats it, after a dance sequence. In the meantime, Gaga mixes poison into all of the dishes she is preparing for the unsuspecting customers causing Gibson and everybody else, including characters played by Semi Precious Weapons and her Great Dane, Lava, to die. Gaga and Beyoncé perform another dance sequence, wearing American flag inspired garments and shredded denims, while strutting around the dead bodies. Gaga and Beyoncé leave the diner in the [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] and travel on a highway as a news reporter (played by Jai Rodriguez) reports the murders at the diner. The final shots shows Gaga and Beyoncé travelling through the desert with police sirens wailing in the background. The video ends with the line [...] "To Be Continued..."
