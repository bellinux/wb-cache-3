50|$|Enstatite is {{magnesium}} silicate, MgSiO3, {{with the}} magnesium partly replaced by small amounts (up to about 12%) of Fe+2. In the bronzite variety, (Mg,Fe)SiO3, the iron(II) oxide ranges from about 12 to 30%, and with still more iron {{there is a}} passage to hypersthene. The ferriferous varieties are liable to {{a particular kind of}} alteration, known as schillerization, which results in the separation of the iron as very fine films of oxide and hydroxides along the cleavage cracks of the mineral. The cleavage surfaces therefore exhibit a metallic sheen or schiller, which is even more pronounced in hypersthene than in bronzite. The color of bronzite is green or brown; its specific gravity is about 3.3-3.4, varying with the amount of iron present. The refractive indices and optic angle increase with iron content. The enstatite endmember has a positive <b>optic</b> <b>sign,</b> whereas bronzite and hypersthene both show a negative <b>optic</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E

Tschermakite shows the characteristic amphibole perfect cleavage on 110. Its average density is 3.24, with a hardness of 5-6; its fracture will be brittle to conchoidal. In thin section its <b>optic</b> <b>sign</b> and 2V angle cover a wide range and are not very useful for identification. It shows a distinct pleochroism in browns and greens.|$|E
40|$|Progressive outer retinal {{necrosis}} (PORN) is most fre-quently seen {{in patients}} with AIDS but may also be seen in patients who are immunosuppressed from other causes. In immunosuppressed patients presenting with an optic neuropathy, an infective cause should always be sought. Infectious optic neuritis in these patients is usually second-ary to meningitis. However, rarely, optic neuropathy can be the fi rst sign of PORN. PORN usually presents with diagnostic signs on retinal examination, but it occasionally presents with optic neu-ropathy without any retinal <b>signs.</b> <b>Optic</b> disc haemorrhage is a previously unreported fi nding in PORN.

40|$|We {{describe}} a young patient {{with an unusual}} intramedullary lesion filled with eosinophils. The 21 -year-old man developed chronic myelitis without <b>optic</b> neuritis or <b>signs</b> of systemic or infectious disease. A spinal biopsy was conducted because of the progressive extension and pseudo-tumoural aspect of the lesion. Histopathological analysis of the biopsy specimen revealed a severe inflammatory process with macrophages and numerous eosinophils. The eosinophil count in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were normal. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data did not correspond with the usual causes of eosinophilic myelitis. Abnormal mite antigen-specific IgE levels and features similar to Japanese cases of atopic myelitis suggested an allergic origin. Despite normal total IgE levels, this case may be the second case of atopic myelitis reported in a Caucasian patient. Striking differences with the first reported case are {{the absence of a}} typical history of atopy and normal total IgE levels.

40|$|The disease {{classification}} neurodegeneration {{with brain}} iron accumulation (NBIA) comprises a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by brain iron deposits in the basal ganglia. For {{about half of}} the cases, the molecular basis is currently unknown. We used homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing to identify a homozygous 11  bp deletion in the orphan gene C 19 orf 12. Mutation screening of 23 ideopathic NBIA index cases revealed two mutated alleles in 18 of them, and one loss-of-function mutation is the most prevalent. We also identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in a case initially diagnosed with Parkinson disease at age 49. Psychiatric <b>signs,</b> <b>optic</b> atrophy, and motor axonal neuropathy were common findings. Compared to the most prevalent NBIA subtype, pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), individuals with two C 19 orf 12 mutations were older at age of onset and the disease progressed more slowly. A polyclonal antibody against the predicted membrane spanning protein showed a mitochondrial localization. A histopathological examination in a single autopsy case detected Lewy bodies, tangles, spheroids, and tau pathology. The mitochondrial localization together with the immunohistopathological findings suggests a pathomechanistic overlap with common forms of neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R
5000|$|The maximum {{separation}} between isogyres {{occurs when the}} slide is rotated exactly 45 degrees {{from one of the}} orientations where the isogyres come together. The point where the isogyres is most tightly curved represents the position of each of the two optic axes present for a biaxial mineral, and thus the maximum {{separation between}} the two curves is diagnostic of the angle between the two optic axes for the mineral. This angle is called the optic angle and often notated as [...] "2V". In some cases, knowing the optic angle can be a useful diagnostic tool to discriminate between two minerals which otherwise look very similar. In other cases, 2V varies with chemical composition in a known way for a given mineral, and its measured value can be used to estimate ratios between elements in the crystal structure - for example, Fe/Mg in olivines. However, in these cases it becomes important to also be sure of the <b>optic</b> <b>sign</b> of the mineral (essentially, this tells you how the optic angle is orientated with respect to the whole optical indicatrix describing the refractive indices of the mineral in 3D). The <b>optic</b> <b>sign</b> and optic angle can be determined together by combining interference pattern microscopy with use of a sensitive tint plate.|$|E
50|$|Hagendorfite {{belongs to}} the monoclinic crystal class, so it is {{assigned}} to the biaxial optical class. Hagendorfite's <b>optic</b> <b>sign,</b> which is negative, is proven by examining its interference figure. Biaxial minerals, including Hagendorfite, have three indices of refraction {{which may or may}} not correspond with the mineral's unequally lengthened axes. A refractive index will provide the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum with the speed of light in the mineral. A single refractive index is given when two rays of light vibrate in the mineral's circular section and move along the optic axes.|$|E
50|$|Sarabauite is a biaxial {{negative}} mineral. All minerals of the monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic {{systems are}} biaxial minerals. Unlike uniaxial minerals, biaxial crystals have 2 optic axes. This means {{they have two}} directions in which light can travel without birefringence, three principal axes, and accordingly three different indices of refraction. Biaxial minerals are further subdivided by <b>optic</b> <b>sign.</b> The optic angle, 2V, is the angle between the two optic axes that is split by {{the direction of the}} lowest index of refraction. If 2V is acute, the mineral is biaxial positive. In sarabauite crystals this angle is obtuse, thus the mineral is biaxial negative.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} characteristics and pathophysiological mechanism of syphilitic optic neuritis.   Methods The clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, electrophysiological examinations, imaging features, treatment and prognosis of 12 cases with syphilitic optic neuritis admitted in our hospital from January 2014 to March 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.   Results The main clinical manifestation was vision loss in 12 patients (18 eyes), with acute or subacute onset, monocular attack or one after other. Degrees of visual loss differed among these patients. They also presented visual field defect and ocular fundus changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed increased {{white blood cell}} and protein. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) assay and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) in serum were positive. RPR assay/toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) and TPHA in CSF were positive. Visual-evoked potential (VEP) showed prolonged latency and declined amplitude of P 100 wave. MRI revealed <b>optic</b> atrophy, abnormal <b>signs</b> in medial orbital part or overall length of optic nerve. The vision was improved after intravenous injection of aqueous penicillin and muscular injection of benzathine benzylpenicillin.   Conclusions Neurosyphilis is a rare cause of optic neuritis. Differential diagnosis should be paid attention on syphilitic optic neuritis from idiopathic optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy. Serologic test and CSF examination will be helpful for a clear diagnosis. Besides, early diagnosis and standard therapy are essential for vision recovery.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2016. 07. 007 </p...|$|R
5000|$|Hubeite is {{most common}} as {{aggregates}} of intergrown crystals (Fig.1) {{that are usually}} less than 5 mm across and that have individual crystals with well-developed faces that are as long as 1 mm (Hawthorne et al., 2002). The color ranges from pale to dark brown, depending on the crystal size (Fig.2). Other properties consist of a pale orange-brown streak, vitreous luster, non-fluorescence, and one good cleavage parallel to the c-axis. It is also brittle with conchoidal fracture, has a hardness of 5.5 in the Mohs scale and a specific gravity of 3.02 (Hawthorn et al., 2002). As for optical features, {{it is important to}} note that hubeite is strongly pleochroic, biaxial with an indeterminate <b>optic</b> <b>sign</b> and has a birefringence of 0.023 (γ-α) (Hawthorne et al., 2002).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Electron probe microanalyses of zoisites from {{high-grade}} metamorph, ic {{rocks in}} Galicia, NW Spain have been obtained. The elements Na, Mg, P, K, Ti, and Mn were not detected above the 0. 1 wt. ~ level. Assuming all Fe is present as Fe 3 +, a clear relation is obtained between the Fe {{content and the}} optic axial angle. Zoisite with 1. 6 wt. ~o Fe 203 proves to be uniaxial at 589 rim; uniaxiality in blue light (470 nm) lies at 1. 5 wt. Fe 203. A change of the <b>optic</b> <b>sign,</b> from positive to negative, isobtained at 2. 9 wt. ~o Fe_~O 3. The presence of minor elements greatly affects this relation, as is indicated by analyses of sector-zoned Sr-bearing zoisites of a muscovite-zoisite p gmatite from the same region. Under retrograde conditions Fe-rich ct-zoisite r acts to form less Fe-rich ~t-zoisite or fl-zoisite and clinozoisite. KnYWORDS: zoisite, metamorphism, optic axial angle, iron, Galicia, Spain.

40|$|Seven autopsied {{cases of}} demyelinating encephalomyelitides are {{examined}} from the clinicopathological aspect. They comprise three cases of neuromyelitis optica, one case of Schilder 2 ̆ 7 s diffuse sclerosis, one case of transitional sclerosis (Poser & Van Bogaert) and two cases of disseminated encephalomyelitis (Table 1). The conclusions {{are as follows}} : 1. Neuromyelitis optica presents not only an acute and monophasic course, but a chronic and polyphasic one as multiple sclerosis. Intervals between the occurrence of <b>optic</b> <b>sign</b> and spinal symptom are various. Lesions are localized mainly on spinal cord and optic nerve, occasionally in the brain stem, cerebellum and cerebrum as tiny lesions. The lesions show typical tissue necrosis and pronounced mesenchymal proliferation with retarded reparatory organization by glial fibrils. 2. The clinical courses of Schilder 2 ̆ 7 s diffuse sclerosis are in general severe and rapid processes suggesting the lesion of occipital lobes, but in a few cases, the chief process originates in the frontal lobe of the bilateral hemispheres and shows a slow progression. Transitional sclerosis (Poser & Van Bogaert), disseminated-diffuse sclerosis, is considered as a main group, while the classic types of both multiple sclerosis and Schilder 2 ̆ 7 s diffuse sclerosis are rather of special type. 3. Disseminated encephalomyelitides with the vascular lesions, such as Behcet 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome and polyarteritis nodosa, show characteristic pathomorphological features supposed to be autoimmune mechanism.

40|$|Leucostaurite {{is a new}} {{nanoporous}} lead borate {{discovered in}} samples from the Mina Asunción, Sierra Gorda, Atacama Desert, Chile, preserved since 1912 in the collections of the Natural History Museum of Bern, Switzerland. Leucostaurite formed via the oxidation of base-metal ores {{in the presence of}} B-rich brines. The mineral name is derived from the Greek “leukos” (white) and “stauros” (cross), and alludes to the white or transparent, colorless cruciform twinned crystals. Leucostaurite forms thin-tabular { 010 }, striated //[100], interpenetrated twinned crystals, and sheaf-like aggregates up to 0. 8 mm on a paralaurionite and boleite matrix. The streak is white and the luster adamantine. Leucostaurite shows a weak, light-yellow fluorescence under short-wavelength UV but no fluorescence under long-wavelength UV light. The mineral is brittle, Mohs hardness ~ 4, with perfect cleavage parallel to { 010 } and good cleavage parallel to { 100 }; calculated density is 5. 071 g/cm 3. Leucostaurite is biaxial, 2 V (meas) ~ 30 °, dispersion: r > v, strong. <b>Optic</b> <b>sign</b> and refractive indices could not be measured, but the average index calculated from the Gladstone-Dale relationship is 1. 849. The empirical formula based on Pb + Sr + Ca = 2 atoms per formula unit (apfu), 1 H apfu and B + Si = 5 apfu, is (Pb 1. 967 Sr 0. 026 Ca 0. 007) ∑ 2. 000 (B 4. 983 Si 0. 017) ∑ 5. 000 (Cl 1. 073 I 0. 004) ∑ 1. 077 O 8. 971 • 0. 5 H 2 O, which simplifies to Pb 2 [B 5 O 9]Cl• 0. 5 H 2 O. The boron content was measured on two crystal fragments using proton-induced γ-ray emission spectroscopy; the analytical value [26. 7 (3) wt% B 2 O 3] is within error of the stoichiometric value of 26. 5 wt% B 2 O 3. Leucostaurite is orthorhombic, space group Pnn 2, a = 11. 376 (2), b = 11. 505 (2), c = 6. 5558 (7) Å, V = 858. 1 (2) Å 3, Z = 4. The seven strongest lines measured in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern are [d in Å/Irel in %]: 4. 04 / 100; 2. 84 / 100; 5. 71 / 80; 2. 019 / 70; 3. 29 / 40; 2. 55 / 40; 1. 877 / 40. The crystal structure of leucostaurite (R 1 = 6. 2 %) contains a hilgardite-type three-dimensional [B 5 O 9] 3 − framework. Leucostaurite is the first mineral of the hilgardite group with orthorhombic (Pnn 2) symmetry. However, several borates synthesized for their non-linear optical properties are structurally and chemically closely related to leucostaurite. For example in Na 0. 5 Pb 2 (B 5 O 9) Cl(OH) 0. 5, one type of channels contains Cl− ions, the other contains OH−, Cl−, and Na+ ions; in leucostaurite these channels are occupied by Cl− ions, and Cl− ions + H 2 O groups, respectively.
