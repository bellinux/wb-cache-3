5|$|Armstrong had {{recovered}} from severe heart {{problems in the}} late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.|$|E
5|$|In early 2007, Thiagarajan {{approached}} M. Karunanidhi {{with the}} intention of making a film on his adaptation of the Ponnar Shankar epic that he had written in the late 1970s. The latter accepted Thiagarajan's offer and approved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to cast his son, Prashanth, in the dual lead roles. In July2008, the project was officially announced in a press meet. The film subsequently began pre-production, with Thyagarajan opting to produce the film under his Sri Lakshmi Shanthi Films banner. The preliminary stages of the production took more than a year, with story-boarding, costume designs and colossal set designs all being finalized. Prashanth revealed that extensive research about the time period alone took a year and a half.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely at the core <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision.</b> The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 {{was taken from the}} trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|Major General Miles {{traveled}} {{aboard the}} USS Yale. While approaching the Mona Passage that separates Puerto Rico {{from the island}} of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles' decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and he feared that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing at Fajardo.|$|E

5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to duel {{while at the}} same time {{intending}} to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{was forced}} to {{publicly}} defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> as the tactical commander {{by a number of}} senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General John Wilton, all of whom had acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of his school education, Rajinikanth continued to perform various {{jobs in the}} cities of Bangalore and Madras, including that of a coolie and carpenter, and finally ended up being recruited in the Bangalore Transport Service (BTS) as a bus conductor. He began {{to take part in}} stage plays after Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. During the time, he came across an advertisement issued by the newly formed Madras Film Institute which offered acting courses. Though his family was not fully supportive <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to join the institute, his friend and co-worker Raj Bahadur motivated him to join the institute and financially supported him during this phase. During his stay at the institute, he was performing in a stage play and got noticed by Tamil film director K. Balachander. The director advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that Rajinikanth quickly followed.|$|E
5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, Brunson {{announced}} that he would be curtailing his recruitment and making his decision between Illinois and Villanova on September 10. On that date, Brunson committed to Villanova. At the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> he was ranked as the number one point guard in the national class of 2015 by Scout.com. Stevenson was a preseason top-10 team in the MaxPreps national high school rankings. A lot was expected of Brunson's team after losing to teams led by Parker and Okafor in the IHSA tournament final four in 2013 and 2014 even though no team from Lake County has ever won a state basketball championship. The team rattled off 11 straight victories to start the season before losing 8881 to Chaminade Prep and its star Jayson Tatum in the Cancer Research Classic in Wheeling, WV, despite 48 points from Brunson. On January 17, Brunson and Stevenson faced Derryck Thornton, Jr. and Findlay Prep at the Hoophall Classic. At the time, Brunson was the number 3 ranked point guard in the class of 2015 and Thornton was the number 2 ranked point guard in the class of 2016 for the number 1 team in the country according to USA Today. Findlay, who was led by Arizona signee Allonzo Trier's 27 points, held Brunson to 26 in the second loss of the season for Stevenson, who had been 151. On January 28, he was named to the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game roster, becoming the second player from Lake County to earn such recognition. On February 2, he was named to the 11-man Team USA for the Nike Hoop Summit. On February 21, Stevenson lost to Simeon as Brunson posted 25 points on 924 shooting, ending a 22-game in-state streak in a game that featured the top two teams in the state. The Simeon frontline featured three Big Ten Conference signees: D. J. Williams (Illinois), Ed Morrow (Nebraska) and Isaiah Moss (Iowa). On March 5, he was named to the Jordan Brand Classic roster.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 27, the hall was orderly. Stone and Hardin both called for the {{convention}} to adjourn sine die. Again, Redwine ruled this motion and the subsequent appeal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> out of order. Leaders for Stone and Hardin announced they would not disrupt the proceedings as they had the previous day {{and that they would}} abide by the convention's decision. As voting proceeded, Stone and Hardin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance against Goebel, and the balloting was deadlocked for twenty-four consecutive ballots. The delegates agreed to drop the third-place candidate on the next ballot; {{that turned out to be}} Stone. The votes of the urban centers, previously divided between Stone and Goebel, now went entirely to Goebel, while the rural western counties that had supported Stone went to Hardin. The vote remained close, but as the alphabetical roll call proceeded, Goebel secured the votes of Stone's Union County delegation, giving him the nomination. Following the vote, Hardin and Stone leaders pledged their support to Goebel, though some did so in qualified terms. For lieutenant governor, the Democrats nominated J. C. W. Beckham who, at age 29, was not yet legally old enough to assume the governorship if called on to do so. Goebel questioned the selection of Beckham because Beckham's native Nelson County had voted for Hardin and was largely controlled by political boss Ben Johnson, but Goebel's allies convinced him that Beckham would be loyal to his program. Among the other nominees was ex-Confederate soldier Robert J. Breckinridge, Jr., for attorney general. This nomination helped placate the numerous ex-Confederates in the party, since Goebel's father had fought for the Union. It was not enough, however, to persuade Breckinridge's brother, former congressman W. C. P. Breckinridge, to support the ticket.|$|E
