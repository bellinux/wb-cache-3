40|$|Sexual {{displays}} often involve {{several different}} ornamental traits. Yet most indicator models of sexual selection {{based on a}} single receiver (usually a choosy female) find that multiple handicap signals should be unstable. Here we study reasons for this contradiction, analyzing signal function, signal content, and trade-offs between signals in the polygynous red-collared widowbird Euplectes ardens. Males have both a long, graduated tail and a red carotenoid collar badge. Territory-holding "residents" have slightly shorter tails than the nonbreeding "floaters," but their carotenoid collars are 40 % larger, and they have (on the basis of reflectance spectrometry and <b>objective</b> <b>colorimetry)</b> a 23 -nm more long-wave ("redder") hue than floaters. This corroborates experimental evidence that the red collar is selected by male contest competition, whereas female choice is based almost exclusively on male tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with the carotenoid signal, which together with body size and condition explains 55 % {{of the variation in}} tail length. The trade-off in tail length and carotenoid investment is steeper among residents, suggesting an interaction with costs of territory defense. We propose that the "multiple receiver hypothesis" can explain the coexistence of multiple handicap signals. Furthermore, the trade-off between signal expressions might contribute to the inverse relation between nuptial tail elongation and coloration in the genus Euplectes (bishops and widowbirds) ...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to the bad}} {{state of}} conservation, “Palazzo Governi”, a seventeenth-century {{building}} located in the old town district of “Stampace” in Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), was subjected to restoration. Thus, according to the Italian Law n. 1089, the main façade colour must be reproduced, and therefore, its identification was required. The available samples looked fairly degraded, in particular as an easy plaster to crumble; so, some other analyses {{able to identify the}} degradation cause were performed. Two different approaches were adopted to attain the first goal, the visual colour assessment by a sensory panel (subjective) and the instrumental measurement by <b>colorimetry</b> (<b>objective).</b> Ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy analyses, as well as conductivity and pH measurements, were performed to evaluate the presence of water-soluble salts inside the plaster, as possible cause of degradation; the binder/aggregate ratio was also evaluated. A full mineralogical and petrographic characterisation of the materials constituting the samples, as well as the identification of their stratigraphy and some other morphologic and structural features suitable to highlight eventual forms of degradation, were performed by optical microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy coupled to X-ray microanalysis was been also used in order to confirm and/or to integrate data obtained by optical microscopy. The samples have been compared with two samples coming from two other buildings, also located in Sardinia, that looked in good conservation state. The results evidenced that the causes of degradation come from a high salt (especially sulphate) content and a scarce presence of binder in the plaster that can be imputed to a wrong initial composition and/ or to a leaching by acidic rain...|$|R
40|$|In {{the thesis}} {{presented}} {{the use of}} <b>colorimetry</b> for <b>objective</b> determination of discolorations of fat tissue in pig slaughter carcasses was tested. The result was {{the development of a}} secure, fast and cost saving method for diagnosis of jaundice in pig slaughtering. The analysis of official meat inspection statistics from one slaughterhouse covering the years from 1994 to 2000 showed that 4. 45 % of all condemned pig slaughter carcasses were classified as not suitable for human consumption due to the diagnosis of jaundice. In the visual inspection directly after slaughtering 11. 57 % were judged as false positive results. After confiscation for 24 hours this judgement was corrected in a repeated inspection of the carcasses. The analysis showed, that jaundice presents an important proportion of the condemnations, these justifying the development and testing of an objective method for jaundice diagnosis. Spectrophotometry and colorimetry by tristumulus measurement are the present <b>objective</b> methods for <b>colorimetry.</b> Both methods were tested for use in the diagnosis of jaundice. The spectrophotometrical investigations were carried out using the Shimadzu Spectrophotometer CM 100. The colorimetrical measurements were made with the Minolta Chromameter CR 300. In pre-tests for spectrophotometry the samples of pigments to be investigated were prepared following the General Administrative Order for Meat Hygiene (AVVFlH) using the alcohol-ether-test-kit. Spectrophotometry allows to differentiate the two-peak-spectra of carotins from the one-peak-spectra of bile-pigments. As the preparation of samples involves costs and time the spectrophotometry is not suitable {{for the development of a}} fast test. However it is possible to objectify the official method by exact measurement of solutions in alcohol-ether-tests. In pre-tests with the Minolta Chromameter CR 300 was found that it is possible to differentiate the pigments by colorimetry very fast and without laboratory peparation. In fat tissues of 54 fattened sows, 54 fattened castrated males and 54 breeding sows, wich were suitable for human consumption, different color-parameters (L*a*b* and L*C*H°) in these diffent groups could be demonstated. From parameters of fattened sows and castrated males a color standard of pig fat tissue (mean ± standarddeviation) was calculated: L* = 67, 81 ± 2, 55; a* = 2, 43 ± 0, 66; b* = 2, 93 ± 0, 69; C* = 3, 85 ± 0, 76; H* = 50, 18 ± 8, 78 In subsequent investigations the fat tissues of 54 uncastrated males, including cryptorchids and hermaphrodites were measured. These fat tissues with a brightness parameter of L* = 78, 85 were brighter than suitable fat tissue. There a differentiation is possible. The colorimetrical investigation of 54 slaughter carcasses with jaundice showed, that icteric pig fat is different from suitable pig fat in all color-parameters (mean ± standarddeviation) : L* = 77, 24 ± 3, 05; a* = 0, 92 ± 1, 14; b* = 8, 48 ± 3, 00; C* = 8, 64 ± 3, 00; H° = 82, 83 ± 9, 36 Only the fat of uncastrated males is similar in brightness L*. By using the colorimetry as fast test for the diagnosis of jaundice limits for brightness L* = 72, 3 and yellowness b 1 * = 4. 6 (with identification of uncastrated males) or b 2 * = 5 (without identification of males) were calculated. It showed that jaundice is present when the color parameters are higher than both limits. The colorimetry using the Minolta Chromameter CR 300 in combination with the calculated limits is useful as fast test in pig fat for the diagnosis of jaundice in fresh slaughtered carcasses. Further investigations showed the influences of technological factors such as time, cooling and residues of slaugtering on fat color. <br /...|$|R
