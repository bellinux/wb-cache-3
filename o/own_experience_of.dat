It is based on Fenwick's <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> attending a four-day session of the est training, an intensive 60-hour personal development course in the self-help genre. Large groups of up to 250 people took the est training at one time.|$|E

Filming took place over 20 days in Los Angeles, California in September 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} partly based on Burke's <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> giving up alcohol {{at a young}} age, since she felt that her {{narrative}} {{had not yet been}} told on film. She and Ponsoldt wrote the script over six months, and the main roles were cast in September 2011.

25|$|Most notable in this line-up was Stephen Beckett in {{the lead}} role. Having {{previously}} played significant roles in The Bill and Coronation Street, he had his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> celebrity-driven media attention to draw on, thereby causing some speculation that the character was based on him. Although he was not drawn in specially for his role (he had appeared in Stephen Joseph Theatre productions before), Alan Ayckbourn reportedly said there was an instinct of Charlie that was like him.|$|E
25|$|The archetypes form {{a dynamic}} {{substratum}} {{common to all}} humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may be conceived as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.|$|E
25|$|But a lot {{of these}} songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from {{anywhere}} and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I’ll take a little of my <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I’ll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I’ll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.|$|E

25|$|After advocating violent action, {{including}} the use of explosive bombs, as a mechanism to bring about revolutionary change, Most was forced into exile by the government. He went to France but was forced to leave at the end of 1878, settling in London. There he founded his own newspaper, Freiheit (Freedom), with the first issue coming off the press dated January 4, 1879. Convinced by his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the futility of parliamentary action, Most began to espouse the doctrine of anarchism, which led to his expulsion from the German Social Democratic Party in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Members of the corvid {{family have}} been known to watch other birds, {{remember}} where they hide their food, then return once the owner leaves. Corvids also move their food around between hiding places to avoid thievery, but only if they have previously been thieves themselves (that is, they remember previous relevant social contexts, use their <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> having been a thief to predict the behavior of a pilferer, and can determine the safest course to protect their caches from being pilfered). Studies to assess similar cognitive abilities in apes have been inconclusive.|$|E

After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that {{had it not been}} for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.|$|E

25|$|Martha leaves Holby {{to attend}} university, {{returning}} {{two years later}} having married in Las Vegas without telling her father. Elliot is upset, so Martha plans a picnic at which Elliot can {{get to know her}} new husband Ben (Oliver Boot) better. At the picnic, Elliot's dog Samson is run over by an ambulance, resulting in a pneumothorax. Elliot operates on Samson in a basement theatre, and he makes a full recovery. When Ben confides in Elliot that he is experiencing on-going health problems, he initially agrees not to tell Martha, not wanting her to worry. Martha later learns Ben is {{in the early stages of}} Sarcoidosis and will be blind within months. Relating his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Gina's failing health, Elliot advises Martha to leave Ben, and ultimately they break up.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Wilks, Rover's chief {{designer}} {{came up with}} a plan {{to produce}} a light agricultural and utility vehicle, of a similar concept to the Willys Jeep used in the war, but with an emphasis on agricultural use. He was possibly inspired by the Standard Motor Company, who faced similar problems and were producing the highly successful Ferguson TE20 tractor in their shadow factory in Coventry. More likely, he used his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> using an army-surplus Jeep on his farm in Anglesey, North Wales. His design added a power take-off (PTO) feature since there was a gap in the market between jeeps and tractors (which offered the feature but were less flexible as transport). The original Land Rover concept (a cross between a light truck and a tractor) is similar to the Unimog, which was developed in Germany during this period.|$|E
25|$|During {{the battle}} {{the use of}} torture by the French {{security}} forces became institutionalised, the techniques ranging from beatings, electroshock (the gegene), Waterboarding, sexual assault and rape. The use of torture was not restricted to Muslims, French FLN sympathisers were also picked up and subjected to it. Maurice Audin a Communist university professor was arrested by the paras on 11 June on suspicion of harboring and aiding FLN operatives, Henri Alleg the Communist editor of Alger républicain was arrested by the Paras at Audin's apartment the following day and was told by Audin {{that he had been}} tortured, Audin was never seen again and it is believed that he either died while being interrogated or was summarily executed. Alleg was subjected to the gegene and waterboarding, following his release he wrote his book La Question published in 1958 which detailed his final meeting with Audin and his <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> torture.|$|E

25|$|The 16-page first issue, {{published}} on April Fools' Day 1963, caused a sensation, selling 6,000 copies by lunchtime of publication day. It parodied The Sydney Morning Herald (and was even printed on The Heralds own presses, adding to its credibility) and led with a front-page hoax about {{the collapse of}} the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It also featured a centre spread {{on the history of the}} chastity belt and a story on abortion — based on Neville's <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> arranging a termination of pregnancy for a girlfriend; abortion was then still illegal in New South Wales. These stories though, would soon lead to the magazine's first round of obscenity charges, but there were also more immediate consequences. As a result of the controversy generated by the abortion story, the Sydney Daily Mirror cancelled its advertising contract, it also threatened to sack Peter Grose from his cadetship unless he resigned from Oz and the Maritime Services Board evicted Oz from its office in The Rocks.|$|E
500|$|... "Photograph" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by the English singer-songwriter, Ed Sheeran, for his second studio album, × (2014). Sheeran wrote the song with Snow Patrol member, Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which the composition developed. After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> being away from his then-girlfriend {{while he was on}} tour.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of those}} {{familiar}} with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her [...] "a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist". Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant, but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris. It is a commonplace of criticism that her <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's. By focusing on misery and describing its cause as [...] "ceaseless persecution" [...] by [...] "the so-called just and righteous", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.|$|E
