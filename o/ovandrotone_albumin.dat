50|$|<b>Ovandrotone</b> <b>albumin</b> {{produces}} transient immunity against androstenedione, and {{the generation}} of antibodies against androstenedione presumably decreases circulating levels of androstenedione. This is thought to result in reduced negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and increased gonadotropin secretion, which in turn improves fertility and fecundity. Indeed, <b>ovandrotone</b> <b>albumin</b> {{has been found to}} significantly increase luteinizing hormone levels throughout the estrous cycle in ewes.|$|E
50|$|Ovandrotone, {{also known}} as androstenedione-7α-carboxyethylthioether, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and the C7α carboxyethylthioether of androstenedione. It is a component of <b>ovandrotone</b> <b>albumin</b> (Fecundin), a conjugate of androstenedione and human serum albumin and an immunogen and vaccine against androstenedione {{that is used to}} generate androgen immunity and thereby increase the ovulation rate and number of lambs born to ewes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ovandrotone</b> <b>albumin</b> (INN, BAN) (brand names Fecundin, Ovastim), {{also known}} as polyandroalbumin, as well as ovandrotone:human serum albumin conjugate, is an {{immunogen}} and vaccine against androstenedione that is used in veterinary medicine to increase the ovulation rate and number of lambs born to ewes. It is a conjugate of ovandrotone (androstenedione-7α-carboxyethylthioether) and human serum albumin. The drug was developed by 1981 and was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 1983.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ovandrotone</b> <b>albumin</b> (Fecundin, Ovastim) and Androvax (androstenedione albumin) are immunogens and {{vaccines}} against androstenedione {{that are}} used in veterinary medicine to improve fecundity (reproductive rate) in ewes (adult female sheep). The generation of antibodies against androstenedione by these agents is thought to decrease circulating levels of androstenedione and its metabolites (e.g., testosterone and estrogens), which in turn increases the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis via reduced negative feedback and increases the rate of ovulation, resulting in greater fertility and fecundity.|$|E
