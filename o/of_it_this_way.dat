Due to the possibility of repetition, the intentions of an individual actor can never be fully present in a speech act.

50|$|In Chinese tradition, {{there is}} not a clear {{distinction}} between the gods and their physical body or bodies (from stars to trees and animals); the qualitative difference between the two seems not to have ever been emphasised.

50|$|To {{perform the}} trick, {{the book is}} held by the binding {{in one hand and}} riffled with the other; for right handed magicians this will {{normally}} mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand.

To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.|$|E

A {{critical}} and aware return to Pragmatism entails a preliminary focus {{about the possibilities}} of a productive communication and a possible exchange among fields of research often far apart for methods and spheres of application, and this difficulty {{is all the more}} strongly if we refer to the contested intellectual legacy of George H.

To do so, Mead’s idea of human creativity is put in a more radical way compared with some previous interpretations <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> is possible to grasp the constructive role of the ‘intrasubjective’ communication and to draw from it some significant implications relative to the individual ethics {{as well as to the}} civil one...|$|R

Placing a wine glass on a table maps well onto actions taken with wine glasses and other tables, and thus maps well onto reality-based interfaces. Thus, it could be seen as an entrée to a NUI experience.|$|R

40|$|What analogies {{and symbols}} {{are used to}} {{graphically}} represent the immaterial soul? What devices are used to make it visible? According to the Jewish and the biblical texts traditions, the soul is a breath that gives life to the body. The Greeks associated the immateriality {{with the image of}} a winged Psyche. The first images of the soul in Christian iconography are based on these concepts. Aquinas confirms the possibility <b>of</b> representing <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> saying that soul and body form a unitary substance. Thus, throughout the Middle Ages, the soul in the picture of a human body appears in distinct iconographic themes: leaving the body on the Virgin or of the saints; in judgments after death, the first and special one, being of the Archangel Michael weighing souls, or in the final one, from which the scenes of Paradise and Hell are designed...|$|R
