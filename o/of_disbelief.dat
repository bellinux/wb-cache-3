5|$|Critics have {{positively}} {{received some}} of the stories within the collection, analyzing Anarky as a unique force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' storytelling. However, the expansive growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbelief.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{allegations}} had not previously been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that {{the allegations}} made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Day and Greene sounded out {{scientists}} and science communicators about their idea, enlisting {{many of their}} contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They met with {{the presidents of the}} city's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears wherever they went, and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City. Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation (SFF), a non-profit organization based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are Alan Alda, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger, the foundation's president Judith Cox, New York University president John Sexton, and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.|$|E
5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E

5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious of the risk <b>of</b> <b>disbelief.</b> For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum {{in the hands of}} king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E

25|$|Wajib As-salat are compulsory, {{non-performance}} {{of which}} renders one a sinner. However, {{the evidence of}} the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salah is obligatory is an act <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief. There are some who believe that as the 5 prayers are obligatory, it automatically renders all other prayers optional.|$|E

25|$|Brawley {{initially}} received considerable {{support from}} the African-American community. Some suggested that Brawley was victimized by biased reporting that adhered to racial stereotypes.

The grand jury's conclusions decreased support for Brawley and her advisers. Brawley's family has maintained that the allegations were true.|$|R
25|$|Film critics Robert Davis and Riccardo de los Rios {{praise the}} films {{narrative}} structure. They comment that in adapting a story such as Battle Royale {{which requires a}} suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> {{to go along with}} its “far-fetched” story Fukasaku instead turns conventional rules of screenwriting on its head. Instead of focusing on the detail of the premise of a near future where school kids kill one another “the filmmakers dispense with premise in a short series of title cards”.|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the hostage crisis was met with shock and dismay throughout the Philippines. Comments ranged from shame, sadness, and sympathy for the hostage victims; anger mixed with a sense <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> at the perpetrator Rolando Mendoza, the police force for its apparent bungling, and media for its overzealous coverage; and concern over {{the damage to the}} image of the country as a tourist destination and the safety and well-being of Filipinos overseas who might experience backlash over the incident.|$|E

25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} stippling and cross-hatching {{can be used to}} create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.|$|E
25|$|Science {{fiction is}} {{largely based on}} writing rationally about {{alternative}} possible worlds or futures. It is related to, but different from fantasy in that, {{within the context of}} the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated physical laws (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). The settings of science fiction are often contrary to those of consensus reality, but most science fiction relies on a considerable degree of suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbelief,</b> which is facilitated in the reader's mind by potential scientific explanations or solutions to various fictional elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, Apology {{is among the}} most {{frequently}} read of his works. In the Apology, Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a sophist and defends himself against charges <b>of</b> <b>disbelief</b> in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the Oracle at Delphi. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.|$|E
