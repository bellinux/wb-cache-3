40|$|Due to {{practical}} and hygienic uses in storage and marketing, cheese maker preference for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> vacuum packaging instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brining method has increased significantly in recent years. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper was {{to study and}} compare the chemistry, biochemistry, and microstructure of Mihalic cheeses ripened in vacuum packaging or under brine over 360 days. Proteolysis in Mihalic cheese was quite low (e. g., pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen was lower than 15 %, as a percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total nitrogen, and as 1 -casein was slower in comparison to other brined cheeses) due to its high salt-in-moisture and low moisture contents. Urea-PAGE patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pH 4. 6 insoluble fractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> showed different degradation patterns of as 1 -casein in cheeses of different ages. However, β-casein was relatively resistant to hydrolysis. Packaging <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> in polyethylene bags significantly increased <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen, 12 % trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen, and free amino acids compared to <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> ripened in brine. <b>The</b> total concentrations <b>of</b> free amino acids (FAA) in cheeses increased after 120 days of ripening, and Glu, Val, Leu, Lys, and Phe were the most abundant FAA in <b>the</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Higher levels <b>of</b> these AAs were found in <b>the</b> <b>cheeses</b> ripened in polyethylene bags.

The obtained results indicate that hard cheeses, such as "Livanjski" <b>cheese,</b> stand <b>the</b> temperatures <b>of</b> deep-freezing well, while <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> structure <b>of</b> white brined "Travnički" cheese, made by autochthonous technology, cracks after thawing. When "Travnički" cheese was produced with a lower percentage of moisture and was stored more freshly it stood the storage at deep-freezing temperatures well...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{collaborative}} {{studies from}} our laboratories reveal <b>the</b> extensive biodiversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microflora <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surfaces <b>of</b> smear-ripened <b>cheeses.</b> Two thousand five hundred ninety-seven strains of bacteria and 2, 446 strains <b>of</b> yeasts from <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smear-ripened <b>cheeses</b> Limburger, Reblochon, Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen, isolated at {{three or four}} times during ripening, were identified; 55 species of bacteria and 30 species of yeast were found. <b>The</b> microfloras <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>cheeses</b> showed many similarities but also many differences and interbatch variation. Very few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commercial smear microorganisms, deliberately inoculated onto <b>the</b> <b>cheese</b> surface, were reisolated and then mainly from <b>the</b> initial stages <b>of</b> ripening, implying that smear cheese production units must have an adventitious "house" flora. Limburger <b>cheese</b> had <b>the</b> simplest microflora, containing two yeasts, Debaryomyces hansenii and Geotrichum candidum, and two bacteria, Arthrobacter arilaitensis and Brevibacterium aurantiacum. <b>The</b> microflora <b>of</b> Livarot was <b>the</b> most complicated, comprising 10 yeasts and 38 bacteria, including many gram-negative organisms. Reblochon also had a very diverse microflora containing 8 yeasts and 13 bacteria (excluding gram-negative organisms which were not identified), while Gubbeen had 7 yeasts and 18 bacteria and Tilsit had 5 yeasts and 9 bacteria. D. hansenii was by far the dominant yeast, followed in order by G. candidum, Candida catenulata, and Kluyveromyces lactis. B. aurantiacum was the dominant bacterium and was found in every batch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5 <b>cheeses.</b> <b>The</b> next most common bacteria, in order, were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, A. arilaitensis, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, and Microbacterium gubbeenense. S. saprophyticus was mainly found in Gubbeen, and A. arilaitensis was found in all cheeses but not in every batch. C. casei was found in most batches of Reblochon, Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen. C. variabile was found in all batches of Gubbeen and Reblochon but in only one batch of Tilsit and in no batch of Limburger or Livarot. Other bacteria were isolated in low numbers from each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheeses,</b> suggesting that each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5 <b>cheeses</b> has a unique microflora. In Gubbeen cheese, several different strains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant bacteria were present, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less common bacteria were present as single clones. The culture-independent method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, resulted in identification of several bacteria which were not found by the culture-dependent (isolation and rep-PCR identification) method. It was thus a useful complementary technique to identify other bacteria in <b>the</b> <b>cheeses.</b> <b>The</b> gross composition, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> increase in pH, and <b>the</b> indices <b>of</b> proteolysis were different in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R
