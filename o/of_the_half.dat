Brenes did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Alabama took a 3–0 lead {{early in}} the second quarter on a 25-yard Cade Foster field goal. On their next possession, the Crimson Tide scored their first touchdown on a two-play drive that saw a 42-yard Kevin Norwood reception and a one-yard Drake touchdown run for a 10–0 lead. Alabama then extended their lead to 24–0 at halftime after touchdown runs of 24-yards from Yeldon and one-yard from Drake on their final two possessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe tetA gene was {{cut into}} its N- and C-terminal halves {{at the central}} EcoRI site and the two halves were subcloned {{individually}} or together under a separate lac promoter/operator. <b>The</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>half</b> was detected with a C-terminal-specific antibody. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>half</b> in <b>the</b> cytoplasmic membrane was not affected by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>half.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>half</b> in <b>the</b> membrane was increased in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>half,</b> indicating that <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>half</b> helps <b>the</b> stable folding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>half</b> in <b>the</b> membrane.

It was the longest scoring drive in Big 12 Championship history.|$|E
5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow Jackets began the first offensive drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half.</b> Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the Yellow Jackets converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the rushing}} success of its {{previous}} drive, Virginia Tech used fullback Josh Oglesby {{in tandem with}} Williams, who also figured prominently in the team's second possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half.</b> The two men combined for 19 yards on the first three plays of the drive, then Williams exited the game because of an injury. After play resumed, Taylor gained 10 yards on a rushing play and completed a 23-yard pass before Oglesby carried the ball again. When the third quarter ended, Virginia Tech faced second down at the Tennessee 30-yard line, still leading 24-14.|$|E

5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into the half, Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked. With two minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> remaining, the ball was played into the centre of the CSKA half; Ignashevich misjudged the flight of the ball, which went over his head and fell to Cissé. His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. The half was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the first chance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half,</b> but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> {{was slightly}} {{more successful than}} Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack. Gerrard played a {{ball into the}} West Ham penalty area, which went {{over the head of}} defender Scaloni and was met by striker Djibril Cissé, who scored to make it 2–1. Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. The last chance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however his shot went out for a throw-in.|$|E

The Bulldogs failed to execute, however, and ended the half without scoring at all. The final play <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> was a pass to tight end Marcel Jensen in the end zone, but he dropped the ball, thus ending the scoring threat.|$|E
