During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. <b>Other</b> <b>glass</b> comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and the window at the east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E

500|$|Duncan & Miller Glass Company was a {{well-known}} glass manufacturing company in Washington, Pennsylvania. [...] Items that were {{produced by the}} company are known as [...] "Duncan glass" [...] or [...] "Duncan Miller glass." [...] The company was founded in 1865 by George Duncan with his two sons and son-in-law in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [...] By 1890, the company joined <b>other</b> <b>glass</b> companies to form the United States Glass Company, a powerful glass trust. In 1892, the factory was destroyed in a fire, and the company was relieved of its trust relationship with the US Glass Company. After the fire, the second generation of the Duncan family moved operations to Washington, Pennsylvania. In 1900, John Ernest Miller, the company's long-time designer, became a full shareholder along {{with members of the}} Duncan family. [...] By 1955, economic pressures from machine-produced glass forced the company to sell off its assets to the US Glass Company, who continued to produce Duncan-style glass until 1980.|$|E

500|$|There were {{charges of}} favoritism in {{purchasing}} programs. Aubrey's friend Keefe Brasselle, who had bit parts in several {{movies in the}} 1940s and 1950s and met Aubrey when they both worked at KNXT, had no experience as a producer. [...] "A 1965 edition of George Raft," [...] said David Susskind, particularly apt as there were also rumors Brasselle had ties to the Mafia. Nevertheless, Aubrey scheduled three shows from Brasselle's Richelieu Productions for the 1964–65 season, all without pilots, still an almost unheard-of practice. (The shows were The Baileys of Balboa, a sitcom with Paul Ford; the newspaper drama The Reporter; and The Cara Williams Show, a sitcom starring red-head Williams, billed as the next Lucille Ball.) Brasselle would personally supervise The Reporter, shot in New York City. Costs skyrocketed on Brasselle's shows– after nine episodes, The Reporter was $450,000 over budget– and all three bombed– The Reporter running only three months, Baileys until April 1965; and Cara Williams finishing the season. Aubrey was later asked why he aired three untested programs. [...] "Arrogance, I guess" [...] he responded. In his book The <b>Other</b> <b>Glass</b> Teat, media critic Harlan Ellison alleges that a Mafia don had put out a contract on Aubrey for beating his daughter during consensual sex at a Las Vegas, Nevada hotel, and that Brasselle demanded the shows {{in exchange for his}} using his own Mafia connections to smooth things over.|$|E
