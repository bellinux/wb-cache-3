40|$|Objectives: We aim to {{elucidate}} the clinical outcomes of bisphosphonate-associated atypical femoral fracture and the clinical results {{depending on the}} bisphosphonate therapy period. Methods: Twenty cases involving 15 patients who {{had been diagnosed with}} atypical femoral facture between 2004 and 2014 and who had been followed up for at least 12 months were retrospectively analyzed. The control group was composed of 15 typical femoral facture patients.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the local and}} regional scale determinants of biodiversity patterns using existing species and environmental data. The research focuses on agricultural environments that have experienced rapid declines of biodiversity during past decades.

The applicability of these databases depends on the required accuracy {{and quality of the}} data needed to answer the landscape ecological and biogeographical questions in hand. Patterns of biodiversity arise from confounded effects of different factors, such as climate, land cover and geographical location. Complementary statistical approaches that can show the relative effects of different factors are needed in biodiversity analyses in addition to classical multivariate models. Better understanding of the key factors underlying the variation in diversity requires the analyses of multiple taxonomic groups from different perspectives, such as richness, <b>occurrence,</b> threat <b>status</b> and population trends.

In this study the <b>occurrence</b> and <b>status</b> of pests and weeds in relation to sowing time and growth habit of winter rye was studied in southern Finland. This was done using three sowing times and four rye varieties in field trials conducted at three locations in 1999 – 2001. The early sown rye was severely affected by pests (Oscinella frit, Mayetiola destructor) and weeds, whereas postponing sowing for two weeks after the recommended sowing time in late August resulted in considerably less damage and the optimal establishment of crop stands. The German hybrid varieties Picasso and Esprit produced more tillers m- 2 in autumn than the Finnish varieties Anna and Bor 7068. However, the number of pests and weeds did not differ among rye varieties. Late sowing of rye should be considered to minimize the need for plant protection. If rye is sown at the recommended time it may still require insecticide treatments promptly in the autumn whereas herbicide treatment need not be determined until spring, after recording the winter mortality of weeds...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. It {{is largely}} known that some {{antipsychotic}} agents could have proconvulsive and proepileptogenic effects {{in some patients}} and could induce EEG abnormalities as well. However, the association of status epilepticus with certain antipsychotic drugs has been very rarely reported. Case Report. A case of an 18 -year-old adolescent girl, with chlorpromazine therapy started for anxiety-phobic disorder was reported. Her personal history disclosed delayed psychomotor development. Shortly after {{the introduction of the}} neuroleptic chlorpromazine therapy in minimal daily dose (37. 5 mg), she developed myoclonic status epilepticus, confirmed by the EEG records. Frequent, symmetrical bilateral myoclonic jerks and altered behavior were associated with bilateral epileptiform discharges of polyspikes and spike-wave complexes. This epileptic event lasted 3. 5 hours and it was stopped by the parenteral administration of valproate and lorazepam; she was EEG monitored until stable remission. Status epilepticus as initial epileptic event induced by neuroleptic agent was not previously reported in our national literature. Conclusion. Introduction of chlorpromazine to a patient without history of seizures is associated with the evolution of an epileptic activity, including the <b>occurrence</b> of <b>status</b> epilepticus. Clinical evaluation of the risk factors possibly related to chlorpromazine-induced seizure is recommended in individual patients before administering this drug...|$|R
40|$|Cultivation of {{ornamental}} plant species {{has been recognized}} to foster plant naturalization of exotics by counteracting environmental stochasticity and continuously providing propagules. As a preliminary attempt to describe the invasion status of C horizontalis, we gathered information on the occurrence of the species in Belgium by compiling various databases. We assessed the naturalization status of C. horizontalis in Belgian calcareous grasslands, high-value habitats recognized as biodiversity hotspots, by characterizing its <b>occurrence,</b> population <b>status,</b> preferred habitats, invaded communities, growth rate and fruiting capacity. We also assessed {{the impact of the}} species on calcareous grasslands communities and on individual species. Cotoneaster occurred in seven of the nine investigated sites, with densities varying from 0. 34 to 10 individuals/ha. In the most invaded sites, the high proportion of small individuals suggests an important ongoing colonization process, emphasized by the fact that fruiting capacities were demonstrated for 3 -year-old individuals. Invaded habitats were typically Mosan Xerobromion habitats, which are priority Natura 2000 habitats. The presence of C horizontalis was associated with changes in both the structure and composition of the community by decreasing species richness and diversity, and affecting grassland specialist species. These impacts are expected to intensify over time with population age and increasing propagule pressure due to close urbanization. Peer reviewe...|$|R

We evaluated the incidence of status epilepticus in patients with seizures secondary to suspected cocaine use. Methods: We performed a retrospective multi-center study of patients with seizures resulting from cocaine use. We identified study subjects at 15 hospitals by record review and conducted a computerassisted records search to identify patients with seizures for each institution over a four-year period. We selected subjects from this group on the basis of cocaine use and determined the <b>occurrence</b> of <b>status</b> epilepticus among them. Data were collected on each subject using a standardized data collection form. Results: We evaluated 43 patients in the ED for cocaine-associated seizures. Their age range was 17 to 54, with a mean age was 31 years; 53 % were male. Of 43 patients, 42 experienced a single tonic-clonic seizure and one developed status epilepticus. All patients had either a history of cocaine use or positive urine drug screen for cocaine. Conclusion: Despite reported cases of status epilepticus with cocaine-induced seizures, the incidence of this complication was unclear based on prior literature. This study shows that most cocaine-associated seizures are self-limited. [West J Emerg Med. 2010; 11 (2) : 157 - 160. ...|$|R
40|$|Whether severe {{epilepsy}} {{could be}} a progressive disorder remains as yet unresolved. We previously demonstrated in a rat model of acquired focal cortical dysplasia, the methylazoxymethanol/pilocarpine - MAM/pilocarpine - rats, that the <b>occurrence</b> of <b>status</b> epilepticus (SE) and subsequent seizures fostered a pathologic process capable of modifying the morphology of cortical pyramidal neurons and NMDA receptor expression/localization. We have here extended our analysis by evaluating neocortical and hippocampal changes in MAM/pilocarpine rats at different epilepsy stages, from few days after onset {{up to six months}} of chronic epilepsy. Our findings indicate that the process triggered by SE and subsequent seizures in the malformed brain i) is steadily progressive, deeply altering neocortical and hippocampal morphology, with atrophy of neocortex and CA regions and progressive increase of granule cell layer dispersion; ii) changes dramatically the fine morphology of neurons in neocortex and hippocampus, by increasing cell size and decreasing both dendrite arborization and spine density; iii) induces reorganization of glutamatergic and GABAergic networks in both neocortex and hippocampus, favoring excitatory vs inhibitory input; iv) activates NMDA regulatory subunits. Taken together, our data indicate that, at least in experimental models of brain malformations, severe seizure activity, i. e., SE plus recurrent seizures, may lead to a widespread, steadily progressive architectural, neuronal and synaptic reorganization in the brain. They also suggest the mechanistic relevance of glutamate/NMDA hyper-activation in the seizure-related brain pathologic plasticity...|$|R
