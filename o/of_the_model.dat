5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> and the abundance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the heavenly bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence.

30|$|The present {{assessment}} {{has several}} uncertainties {{that influence the}} calculations. These uncertainties originate from the incalculable small-scale environmental conditions and also from <b>the</b> climate <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climate projection is caused by many factors. Some arise from <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> method and <b>the</b> natural climate variability. However, <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> social and economic changes in the future (the anthropogenic climate forcing factor in <b>the</b> <b>models)</b> is <b>the</b> most difficult and therefore the most uncertain part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climate <b>model</b> simulation results can hardly decrease due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> data (Bartholy et al. 2008).|$|R

5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E
