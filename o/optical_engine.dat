40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate appearance of surface ignition- postignition experienced inside the engine cylinder and correlate it with the nature of the spark ignition combustion prior to the onset of surface ignition. The test engine used to carry out all experiments was a Jaguar <b>optical</b> single-cylinder <b>engine,</b> operating in spark-ignition mode, although with negative valve overlap. The optical configuration of the engine allows characterizing and analyzing combustion process based on the processing of captured images in correlation with in-cylinder pressure and other parameters recorded with regard to instantaneous engine operating conditions. Results of the experiments covered in this publication focus on flame propagation and development as well as reveal occurrence of abnormal combustion processes. Experimental observations, especially the captured images show a relationship between the nature of normal combustion process initiated by spark discharge and the existence of abnormal combustion phenomena. All tests were performed under fixed engine conditions – constant speed and single component hydrocarbon fuel. Because the nature of fuel can shape the combustion process, a brief discussion and a proposed correlation of anti-knock, auto-ignition, and resistance to surface ignition qualities of a few single-and multi-component fuels is presented.

Glass waveguides fabricated by silver ion-exchange in glass panels have attracted significant interest as a cost-effective candidate due to their very low optical loss at key wavelengths and efficient coupling to optical fiber.

Still, the performance of glass waveguides can be optimized by adjusting the refractive index profile for the specific requirements of complex circuits with small pitch, high-number of crossings and tight bends.

40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{in-cylinder}} airflow, {{and its effects}} on combustion and emissions, in a modern, heavy-duty diesel engine. The in-cylinder airflow is examined experimentally in an <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> and the flow field inside the cylinder is quantified and shown during combustion, crank angle resolved. Cross-correlation on combustion pictures, with its natural light from black body radiation, has been done to calculate the vector field during the injection and after-oxidation period. In this work, this technique is called combustion image velocimetry (CIV). The quantified in-cylinder flow is compared with simulated data, calculated using the GT-POWER 1 -D simulation tool, and combined with single-cylinder emission measurements at various in-cylinder airflows. The airflow in the single cylinder, characterised by swirl, tumble and turbulent intensity, was varied by using an active valve train (AVT), which allowed change in airflow during the engine’s operation. The same operation points were examined in the single-cylinder engine, <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> and simulated in GT-POWER. This work has shown that the in-cylinder airflow has a great impact on emissions and combustion in diesel engines, even at injection pressures up to 2, 500 bar, with or without EGR and load up to 20 -bar IMEP. Swirl is the strongest player to reduce soot emissions. Tumble has been shown to affect soot emissions negatively in combination with swirl. Tumble seems to offset the swirl centre and the offset is observed also after combustion in the <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> tests. Injection pressure affects the swirl at late crank angle degrees during the after-oxidation part of the combustion. Higher injection pressure gives a higher measured swirl. This increase is thought to be created by the fuel spray flow interaction. The angular velocity in the centre of the piston bowl is significantly higher compared with the velocity in the outer region of the bowl. Higher injection pressure gives larger difference of the angular velocity. Calculated swirl number from the CIV technique has also been compared with other calculation methods, GT-POWER and CFD-based method. The result from the CIV technique are in line with the other methods. CFD-based calculations, according to [62], has the best fit to the CIV method. The GT-POWER calculations shows the same trend at low swirl number, but at high swirl number the two methods differs significantly. QC 20120302 </p...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{engines are}} used as {{research}} and development tools to study the combustion inside internal combustion engines. Conventional optical engines uses an extended piston {{in order to be}} able to observe the combustion chamber from below, through the piston. This extended piston, or Bowditch piston, limits the load and speed in which the engine can operate due to its geometrically weak design and considerable mass. This master thesis proposes a design for a new type of <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> that has significantly higher mechanical performance compared to conventional optical engines. The new design may provide an engine speed increase of up to 100 %. Optical engines are often single cylinder internal combustion engines, fitted with transparent parts providing optical access to the combustion chamber. Using the optical access, various processes taking place in the combustion chamber may be studied optically which becomes more and more important in today's advanced engines, some of which are direct injected. The <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> can be fitted with a transparent liner providing optical access from the side of the combustion chamber, together with the Bowditch piston providing access from below. These pistons are known for their high weight and low stiffness, frequently limiting engine speeds and cylinder pressures to low or moderate. For a standard <b>optical</b> <b>engine</b> with car engine specifications, maximum speeds can be around 2500 RPM. By summer 2014 Anders Dahl and Kristoffer Clasén came up with the idea of how to replace the Bowditch piston in an <b>optical</b> <b>engine.</b> By reconfiguring the conrod and crankshaft, optical access was achieved from beneath the piston rather than inside, making the piston shorter, lighter and therefore stronger. The reconfiguration also resulted in higher force absorption, which is a key feature since increasing engine speed drastically increases the piston acceleration and hence the reaction forces. The concept was consumed by Bohus Automotive AB and a master thesis in collaboration with the division of combustion at Chalmers was initiated. The work was divided in two parts; development and validation of the piston, and development of an engine comprising the piston. The aim of the piston validation was to determine a first estimate of the mechanical performance. A piston design was created using the CAD-software Inventor and an iterative approach. When the design had matured it was analysed by FEM with regard to stress, using the commercial FE-software Ansys Workbench Mechanical. Parallel to the piston an engine design was developed using the same software and iterative approach. The aim of the engine development was to establish a suitable engine layout comprising the piston concept. Without an engine, the piston has no use. Much of the engine was created using engineering intuition to be able to create a whole engine design within the project time, and the engine will need its own verification in the future. The piston analyses showed promising results, indicating a performance increase of up to 100 % in engine speed compared to the Bowditch design. Likewise, a successful engine with a compact design was established that fulfilled the demands on ease of use and accessibility. A few simplifications and assumptions have been implemented in the analyses, and more work is needed in the future to verify other components such as crankshaft and conrods. The transparent parts have been excluded from the analyses since they would inevitably limit the performance. Normally the transparent liner would be the first component to break. There is however a configuration option of the new engine that excludes the transparent liner which would allow much higher loads than usual...|$|E
