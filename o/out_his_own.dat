5|$|During his grandfather's reign Muzzam was {{appointed}} vizer of Lahore from 1653-1659. In 1663, {{when he was}} twenty years old, Mu'azzam was made {{the governor of the}} Deccan province. The most important issue in front of him was to curb the rise of Shivaji, who was on the ascendant in the area, and had carved <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Boyce financed an {{expedition}} of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near Nome and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which {{led him to}} finance other Schwatka expeditions {{as well as those}} of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the Yukon River in 1898. Boyce soon began to carry <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> expeditions. When the United States entered the Spanish–American War in 1898, Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship Three Friends. The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown.|$|E

50|$|A player may not plain-move or canter one of {{his pieces}} (Knight or Man) into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle. If an enemy piece reaches a square {{adjacent}} to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle, a player may jump, or make the jumping portion of a Knight's Charge, over that enemy piece into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle. A player may not, during the cantering portion of a Knight's Charge, move his Knight into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle. If a player jumps over an opponent's piece into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle, and the player's piece is then next to an exposed enemy piece, the jumping must continue (<b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle) {{as part of that}} same move. A player who has jumped {{one of his}} pieces over an opponent's piece into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle, and in so doing was unable to continue the jumping <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle as part of that same move, must, on his next turn to move, immediately move that piece <b>out</b> from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle, with no exception. A player moving one of <b>his</b> pieces <b>out</b> from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle must jump out, if possible, instead of plain-moving or cantering out. If a player has the opportunity to jump <b>out</b> from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> castle, he may, if he can, satisfy the obligation to capture by means of moving out with a Knight's Charge instead.|$|R
5|$|Despite a life {{filled with}} bad luck—having Tourette syndrome, {{being struck by}} lightning, and losing one of his {{testicles}} to cancer—Harvie remains optimistic, living <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> eccentric way of life. In one of the pivotal episodes of his life, Harvie sits in the park next to a statue of Horace while he hears the instructional Carpe diem, which inspires him to make many changes in his life, such as embracing nudism and embarking on daring rescue missions for animal rights. He marries Val, a nurse he meets in hospital, and they adopt a daughter, Ruby, who has deformed limbs due {{to the effects of}} thalidomide.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Timmy makes a wish {{to star in}} his own movie trilogy (In parodies of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter). He is {{interrupted}} by Jorgen, who takes his fairy godparents away and sends Timmy home. When he gets there, Timmy's parents and school friends don't remember him, and an Eliminator appears after Timmy calls <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> name. In an alley, the Eliminator projects a space vortex through its mouth to inhale Timmy. Jorgen saves him, and the two arrive at Fairy World. Meanwhile, the fairies are hidden as gumballs inside a truck stop bar by Jorgen. After being blown into a bubble from a kid's mouth, Cosmo takes Wanda and Poof {{with him as he}} floats away. The rest of the fairies use Cosmo's method as their escape plan.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden tried to keep Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford Meek, Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones Meek had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together an outfit at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were still his men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage had been done to their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E
