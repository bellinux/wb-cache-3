5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To assess {{hospital}} waste management in nonteaching hospitals of Lucknow city. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive {{study was conducted}} on <b>the</b> staffs <b>of</b> nonteaching <b>hospitals</b> of Lucknow from September 2012 to March 2013. A total of eight hospitals were chosen as the study sample size. Simple random sampling technique was used for <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonteaching <b>hospitals.</b> A pre-structured and pre-tested interview questionnaire was used to collect necessary information regarding <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> and biomedical waste (BMW) management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> <b>The</b> general information about <b>the</b> selected hospitals/employees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> was collected. Results: Mean {{hospital waste}} generated in <b>the</b> eight nonteaching <b>hospitals</b> <b>of</b> Lucknow was 0. 56 kg/bed/day. About 50. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> did not have BMW department and colored dustbins. In 37. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals,</b> there were no BMW records and segregation at source. Incinerator was used only by hospital A for treatment of BMW. Hospital G and hospital H had no facilities for BMW treatment. Conclusion: There {{is a need for}} appropriate training of staffs, strict implementation of rules, and continuous surveillance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>of</b> Lucknow to improve the BMW management and handling practices...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} how prepared operating departments are to manage latex-allergic patients, and particularly urologists, because <b>the</b> highest incidence <b>of</b> latex allergy occurs {{in patients with}} spina bifida who undergo frequent urological procedures. Methods A standard questionnaire about <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> latex-free equipment within operating theatres was completed by <b>the</b> 72 <b>hospitals</b> surveyed (33 district general, 27 teaching, six children's and six private hospitals). Results Anaesthetic latex-free equipment was available in five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children's <b>hospitals,</b> 56 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teaching <b>hospitals,</b> 45 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district general <b>hospitals</b> and two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private <b>hospitals.</b> A latex-free catheter only was provided in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children's <b>hospitals,</b> 30 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teaching <b>hospitals</b> and 12 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district general <b>hospitals.</b> In addition, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children's <b>hospitals</b> and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private <b>hospitals</b> had a comprehensive range of urological latex-free equipment available.

5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
