In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E

The club record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The record stands to this day, and is unlikely to be beaten due to the scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000.

Following the deaths of Booth in the war and Alonzo Drake from illness, {{as well as the}} decline in the bowling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an {{effective}} attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main bowler. He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat he scored three centuries and reached 1,135 runs at 29.10. His performances earned him a place in the Gentlemen v Players match at the end of season during the Scarborough Festival, although he neither took a wicket nor scored. Kilner's brother Norman also played for Yorkshire in 1919, although he was ultimately unable to secure a permanent place in the team.|$|E
