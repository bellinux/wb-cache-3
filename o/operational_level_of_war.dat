In 1940, French military theorists still mainly considered tanks as infantry support vehicles and French tanks were slow (except for the SOMUA S35) compared to German tanks, enabling German tanks to offset their disadvantages by out-manoeuvring French tanks. At various points in the campaign, the French were not able to achieve the same tempo as German armoured units. The state of training was also unbalanced, with the majority of personnel trained only to man static fortifications.

40|$|Our {{nation has}} a truly {{impressive}} array of space-based capabilities supporting our armed forces. However, much of this support is focused at the strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> There are several areas of desired improvement in the space force enhancement mission area at the tactical <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> that could be addressed by small, inexpensive satellites dedicated for use by tactical land warfighters. One of these areas of desired improvement is tactical beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, including support for ground sensors, text message relay, voice communications, and image or video transmission. Technical solutions to fill these areas of desired improvement should be relatively inexpensive, and more importantly, taskable by tactical users {{in the area of}} operations. New trends in the miniaturization of electronic components are leading to smaller satellites with significant capabilities in the nanosatellite (1 - 10 kg) and microsat (10 - 100 kg) classes. For example, the CubeSat standard for nanosatellites now being built by universities around the world is based on tiny cube-shaped satellites with dimensions of only 10 cm on a side and weighing about 1 kg. Slightly larger nanosatellite configurations, with multiple cube formats, allowing for missions from low earth orbit with broader scopes are under investigation by organizations such as NASA, Boeing, and the US Army. One technical approach that could address today’s tactical BLOS communications area of desired improvement for the tactical warfighter would be a constellation of nanosatellites in low earth orbit. To investigate the feasibility of such a constellation, the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is executing the Space and Missile Defense Command – Operational Nanosatellite Effect, or SMDC-ONE, technology demonstration. The key SMDC-ONE demonstration thresholds for success involve designing, developing, building and qualification testing of two nanosatellite units, and acceptance testing of eight flight units within a one-year timeframe ending in April 2009. A custom communications payload will deliver a capability to support simulated ground sensors and text message relay. Communications beyond this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> complexity were not included in this demonstration to reduce schedule risk.

40|$|Deception {{has been}} a part of warfare {{throughout}} history and has proven a very effective force multiplier when employed correctly. Many esteemed military theorist have espoused the merits of deception including; Sun Tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, Mao Tse Tung, and Basil Liddell Hart. The challenge, however, in incorporating military deception is that it can be very difficult to plan, coordinate, and synchronize from the strategic through the <b>operational</b> and tactical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The increased demand for intelligence, information superiority, as well as the increased need for operational security to conduct successful deception also present a significant challenge to military planners. Additionally, deception requires a great deal of creativity and unconventional thinking on the part of the deceiver and is considered more art than science which makes it difficult to train within the military. Although the U.

This involved the revision and testing of a developmental matrix and measure of art critical abilities, that had been devised in previous studies (Hickey, 1975; Stuart, 1989). The matrix was revised to project three <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> development for critical abilities, that were derived from projecting key concepts through four phases of a critical or cognitive strategy. Key concepts were projected for three art functions and contextual enquiry. The modal measure was revised to provide criteria for projecting and assessing three <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> development for each ability. A descriptive multi-disciplinary research strategy was used to test the objectivity of the projected matrix and measure. The testing was undertaken with thirty-one case studies derived fromjunior, middle and upper schools. The data was collected from children aged seven to eighteen years of age with three operational measuring instruments to test <b>operational</b> <b>levels,</b> reasoning and vocabulary. The objectivity of the matrix was indicated by a correspondence between Piagetian <b>operational</b> <b>levels</b> and modal reasoning for three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> development. The objectivity of 2 the modal measure was indicated by a triangulation of operational, modal and vocabulary scores. The findings confirmed the previous testing in that the modal measure <b>of</b> the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> explanations provided an objective measure of art critical development.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{economically}} produce expert Command and Control crew members, personnel must participate {{more frequently}} in meaningful training experiences. Current Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) training requires active duty personnel to attend only one major and three minor exercises every year. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel are required to attend one major and three minor exercises every three years to meet continuous training requirements. Currently there are significant gaps {{in our ability to}} provide training for many AOC positions due to the change in focus from tactical operations to the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> At the <b>operational</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> the stimulus for training is the information provided, not the movement of entities in a synthetic battlespace.
