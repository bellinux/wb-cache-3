40|$|In {{this paper}} I first address the {{problems}} that arise when we pose the question <b>of</b> what the <b>play</b> is. Where, may we hope to find {{the answer to the}} question of what constitutes the essence <b>of</b> <b>play?</b> By reconsidering Gadamer’s critique of Kant’s concept <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and by engaging with Gadamer’s methodological assumptions, I argue for the importance of staying with our actual experience <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> In characterizing the experience of how it is to play, I try to locate the evidence of the essence <b>of</b> <b>play</b> as it manifests itself in this experience. In the experience <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> we are lead into the turned-in-on-itself world <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> which is the only world for the player. The latter is immersed in the aimless to-and-froing <b>of</b> <b>play</b> which happens as a perpetual self-renewal, making the rules of the game and every possible aim inside the world <b>of</b> <b>play</b> the medium <b>of</b> <b>play</b> itself...|$|R

50|$|Interestingly, {{the above}} line <b>of</b> <b>play</b> {{starting}} with the deep finesse also fails to optimise the matchpoint objective as it gets beaten by another line <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> In turns {{out that there are}} a total of eight lines <b>of</b> <b>play</b> that are non-transitive: the eight lines <b>of</b> <b>play</b> can be thought to be placed on a circle such that each line <b>of</b> <b>play</b> beats its left neighbor.

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>plays,</b> instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1860s to {{the early}} 1870s, W. S.

His output in 1870 included dozens of his popular comic Bab Ballads; two blank verse comedies, The Princess and The Palace of Truth; two comic operas, Our Island Home and The Gentleman in Black; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.|$|E

40|$|Publisher東京論文The notion <b>of</b> <b>play</b> {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of activities such as card games, digital games, hobbies, and sports. Although we consider such playful activities to be ordinary these days, the explicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> or difference between play and game is unclear. This paper attempts to understand the historical changes in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> that can be found in academic discourse in order to explore a new direction <b>of</b> <b>play</b> study within sociological contexts. By reviewing the various theories <b>of</b> both <b>play</b> and game, we can come {{to a better understanding of}} how the notions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> differ between English and Japanese because Japanese lacks an explicit translation for the words "game" and "ludic. " To achieve this outcome, we must first adjust the main difference between the two languages. Furthermore, this paper elucidates that sociology in Europe and the United States has focused on "game" to understand play. In contrast, Japanese sociology refers to neither game nor play, instead distinguishes between leisure and work. This paper seeks to bridge the gaps between the understanding <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game in English and Japanese. In addition, this paper investigates the significant shift in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game brought about by the recent information technology revolution. It shows that the development of digital games can be seen as a starting point to form a new definition <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game from interdisciplinary perspectives. In this phenomenon, new play researchers have begun to define play and game. This paper also reviews some definitions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game used in digital technologies and introduces the new direction <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game studies, such as "Ludology. " Finally, by locating digital games as the central subject <b>of</b> <b>play</b> research, new definitions <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and game de-emphasize the division between play and work seen in previous sociological research...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews Piaget's stages <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and {{discusses}} the implications <b>of</b> <b>play</b> for early childhood education. The three stages <b>of</b> <b>play</b> identified in Piaget's research are: (1) practice play, (2) symbolic or make believe play and (3) games with rules.

The relationship between each stage <b>of</b> <b>play</b> and the individual's cognitive developMent is then discussed in detail.

The match of the child's present developmental abilities to the activities in the environment is identified {{as the most important}} aspect of planning for children's play.

5|$|John Rice, a boy actor {{with the}} King's Men, {{may have played}} Lady Macbeth in a {{performance}} of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611. The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book <b>of</b> <b>Plays</b> and Notes thereof per Formans for Common Policy. His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor {{and may have been}} played by a man in early performances.|$|E
5|$|Private theatricals were an {{essential}} part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series <b>of</b> <b>plays</b> in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's The Rivals (1775) and David Garrick's Bon Ton. Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.|$|E

5|$|The plays {{were written}} across thirty-six years of Sophocles' career {{and were not}} {{composed}} in chronological order, but instead were written in the order Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Oedipus at Colonus. Nor were they composed as a trilogy – a group <b>of</b> <b>plays</b> to be performed together, but are the remaining parts of three different groups <b>of</b> <b>plays.</b> As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, Creon is the undisputed king {{at the end of}} Oedipus Rex and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes. Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus' daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of Oedipus Rex. By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus' sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession. In Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: Ismene explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon. Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed. In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in Oedipus at Colonus, Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l. 429, Theodoridis, tr.) to their father's going to exile, which is one of his bitterest charges against them.|$|E
5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor <b>of</b> <b>plays</b> to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance <b>of</b> <b>plays</b> and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E
