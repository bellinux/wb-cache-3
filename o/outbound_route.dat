Cross-docking is a critical part of many fashion and textiles supply chains in practice because it can help to achieve many supply chain strategies such as postponement. We consider a model where there are multiple suppliers and customers in a single cross-docking center. With such a model setting, the issue concerning the coordinated routing between the inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>routes</b> is much more complex than many traditional vehicle routing problems (VRPs). We formulate the optimal route selection problems from the suppliers to the cross-docking center and from the cross-docking center to the customers as the respective VRPs. Based on the relationships between the suppliers and the customers, we integrate the two VRP models to optimize the overall traveling time, distance, and waiting time at the cross-docking center. In addition, we propose a novel mixed 0 / 1 integer linear programming model by which the complexity of the problem can be reduced significantly. As demonstrated by the simulation analysis, our proposed model can be solved very efficiently by a commonly used optimization software package...|$|R

50|$|The trail {{originally}} {{started at}} the River Flesk, 1 km from Killarney, but has since been extended to start in the centre of Killarney. The initial stage passes through the grounds of Muckross House, the gateway to Killarney National Park, passing the shores Lough Leane and Muckross Lake to reach Torc Waterfall. From Torc, the trail follows the Old Kenmare Road and crosses Esknamucky Glen to reach the Black Valley. The Way passes through the Black Valley below Macgillycuddy's Reeks, including Carrauntoohil, Ireland's highest mountain. It then follows a road through Cummeenduff Glen to reach Bridia Valley. It then follows the Lack Road over another mountain pass into Derrynafeana Glen to reach Lough Acoose where it then follows a road {{to the village of}} Glencar. From Glencar, the trail follows the Caragh River valley before circling Seefin Mountain to reach Glenbeigh. There are two marked routes around Seefin: a shorter route {{to the west of the}} mountain via Windy Gap or a longer route to the east above Lough Caragh and overlooking Dingle Bay. The Way then climbs and follows the hills overlooking Dingle Bay until it reaches Drung Hill, where it turns inland to Foilmore. An 11 km linking spur provides a connection from Foilmore to Cahersiveen. From Foilemore, the route traverses two ridges to reach the village of Waterville. From Waterville, there are two possible routes to Caherdaniel: a coastal trail around Farraniargh Mountain or an inland trail, crossing Capall River and crossing mountains via Windy Gap to Caherdaniel. An old coach road brings the Way to Sneem. Sneem and Kenmare are connected by a trail that follows the coast above Kenmare River. The final stretch crosses the mountains between Kenmare and Killarney via another Windy Gap rejoining the <b>outbound</b> <b>route</b> of the Way at Galway's Bridge retracing the route through Muckross to the end in Killarney.|$|E
50|$|After a fruitless {{search for}} Cunningham, Mitchell decided to {{continue}} the expedition. He followed the Bogan River downstream, sometimes employing aboriginal guides, with the usual payment being a Tomahawk. After several days and about 50-60 miles of travel, a brief confrontation between {{a member of the}} party and an aborigine resulted in the aborigine being wounded by shotgun pellets. He survived, and his wounds were dressed at a tent, after which he left. The Darling River was reached at the end of May and the expedition continued for about 12 miles down the left bank. Mitchell decided to build a fort for safety while allowing time for the animals to refresh. He named the location Fort Bourke in honour of the Governor, Richard Bourke. Two whale boats had been transported the whole distance on the bullock drays, so on 1 June Mitchell launched the boats on the Darling to transport the party down river. However, the river became shallower and unnavigable downstream resulting in the expedition resorting once again to overland progress. On 8 June the expedition departed Fort Bourke once again, encountering many tribes as they headed south, and by 15 June were 90 miles from the fort. One tribe appeared more hostile than others, kicking up dust and spitting at party members when they were retrieving water from the river. Mitchell and party were just north of Menindee on 9 July, and while camped for three days, noticed several tribes congregating which he took to be premeditated. He was planning on splitting the party to advance down the Darling faster, but he assessed the situation as becoming dangerous and decided instead to keep the men together and return to Sydney. Mitchell noted that just after he communicated to the party his decision to retreat, they heard shots from a forage party up the river. Following a brief skirmish, at least three aborigines had been killed, including a woman and her child. One {{of the members of the}} expedition had been knocked unconscious. On 14 July, the party commenced their return via the <b>outbound</b> <b>route.</b> Mitchell decided to avoid contact with the various tribes as much as possible on their return. They were at the Fort Bourke on 10 August and Peak Hill, close to the frontier, on 9 September where they learned from station stockmen of the death of Cunningham. When back in Sydney, Mitchell added some passages which were not in his journal that seemed to implicate some of his men in the deadly incident near Menindee.|$|E

40|$|Desert ants, Cataglyphis in North Africa and Melophorus {{in central}} Australia, exhibit amazing feats of navigation. This essay {{will focus on}} the {{architecture}} of the insect’s navigational toolkit. It will cover four main topics: First, vector navigation (path integration, PI) is the ant’s major means of navigation at least in so far as it is running all the time while the animal is on its foraging journey, irrespective of whether landmark-based systems of navigation are expressed as well, or are even dominating the insect’s behaviour. The path integrator relies on the simultaneous input from a compass and an odometer. Both tools of navigation have been studied extensively in Cataglyphis and are briefly summarized. In fact, among all animal navigators studied so far the insect’s skylight compass is the module of navigation that has been worked out best in neurophysiological terms. It has been computer simulated and implemented into an autonomous agent (Sahabot). The ant’s odometer – actually a stride integrator, or pedometer – computes distances covered along two- and three-dimensional paths, in the latter by projecting the 3 -D path on to a 2 -D plane. Second, while foraging within cluttered environments desert ants can learn a number of different routes, discriminate between inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>routes</b> and follow these routes independently of the state of their path integrator (landmark-based route navigation, LN). If displaced to near-by locations, they rejoin a habitual route at any one point at which they come to hit it. Among the quite impressive amount of route memories which an ant is able to acquire, at any one time the proper memory is retrieved by a combination of internal (motivational) as well as external cues, and the proper route is selected. Third, PI and LN represent quite separate modules of navigation. PI is used to establish LN, but once established, LN can work independently of PI. In particular experimental paradigms this independence can lead to astonishingly aberrant behaviour. However, both systems might employ similar neural stratagems in so far as in either system information acquired during an animal’s foraging trip (a reference vector in PI and a stored sequence of visual and motor memories in LN) is later, on subsequent trips, continuously compared with currently incoming information (the current PI vector and the current sensorymotor data in LN). The ant moves so as to continually reduce the mismatch between reference “templates” on the one side and current sensory inputs and motor outputs on the other. Fourth, desert ants use the information provided by their PI and LN systems in a strictly cue-dependent procedural way rather than by acquiring and using a cartographical representation, or survey map, of their foraging terrain. Even if Cataglyphis moves along novel routes (a behavioural performance always regarded as ẗheöperational criterion indicative of using map information), it does so by memorizing different PI vectors and by merely matching current vector states to downloaded reference vectors. Following procedures rather than computing spatial positions is the insect’s way of navigation...|$|R
5|$|Most <b>outbound</b> O-Bahn bus <b>routes</b> {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, {{followed}} by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|R
40|$|Individually {{foraging}} desert ants {{of central}} Australia, Melophorus bagoti, exhibit amazingly precise mechanisms of visual landmark guidance when navigating through cluttered environments. If trained to shuttle {{back and forth}} between the nest and a feeder, they establish habitual <b>outbound</b> and inbound <b>routes,</b> which guide them idiosyncratically across the natural maze of extended arrays of grass tussocks covering their foraging areas. The route-based memories that usually differ between outbound and inbound runs are acquired already during the first runs to the nest and feeder. If the ants are displaced sideways of their habitual routes, they can enter their stereotyped routes at any place and then follow these routes with the same accuracy as if they had started at the usual point of departure. Furthermore, the accuracy of maintaining a route does not depend on whether homebound ants have been captured at the feeder shortly before starting their home run and, hence, with their home vector still fully available (full-vector ants), or whether they have been captured at the nest after they had already completed their home run (zero-vector ants). Hence, individual landmark memories can be retrieved independently of the state of the path-integration vector with which they have been associated during the acquisition phase of learning. However, the ants display their path-integration vector when displaced from the feeder to unfamiliar territory...|$|R
40|$|Many animals rely on path {{integration}} for {{navigation and}} desert ants are the champions. On leaving the nest, ants continuously integrate their distance {{and direction of}} travel so that they always know their current distance and direction from the nest and can take a direct path to home. Distance information originates from a step-counter and directional information {{is based on a}} celestial compass. So far, it has been assumed that the directional information obtained from ocelli contribute to a single global path integrator, together with directional information from the dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eyes and distance information from the step-counter. Here, we show that ocelli mediate a distinct compass from that mediated by the compound eyes. After travelling a two-leg <b>outbound</b> <b>route,</b> untreated foragers headed towards the nest direction, showing that both legs of the route had been integrated. In contrast, foragers with covered compound eyes but uncovered ocelli steered in the direction opposite to the last leg of the <b>outbound</b> <b>route.</b> Our findings suggest that, unlike the DRA, ocelli cannot by themselves mediate path integration. Instead, ocelli mediate a distinct directional system, which buffers the most recent leg of a journey. 3 page(s...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe viral genomes of α- and γ-retroviruses {{follow an}} <b>outbound</b> <b>route</b> through the {{cytoplasm}} before assembling with the budding particle at the plasma membrane. We show here that {{murine leukemia virus}} (MLV) RNAs are transported on lysosomes and transferrin-positive endosomes. Transport on transferrin-positive vesicles requires both Gag and Env polyproteins. In the presence of Env, Gag is rerouted from lysosomes to transferrin-positive endosomes, and virion production becomes highly sensitive to drugs poisoning vesicular and endosomal traffic. Vesicular transport of the RNA does not require prior endocytosis, indicating that it is recruited directly from the cytosol. Viral prebudding complexes containing Env, Gag, and retroviral RNAs are thus formed on endosomes, and subsequently routed to the plasma membrane. This may allow retroviruses to hijack the endosomal machinery {{as part of their}} biosynthetic pathway. More generally, tethering to vesicles may provide an efficient mechanism for directed RNA transport...|$|E
