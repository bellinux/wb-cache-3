60|$|He sprang {{for me with}} a half-roar, {{gripping}} my arm. I had steeled {{myself to}} brazen it out, though I was trembling inwardly; but the enormous strength of the man {{was too much for}} my fortitude. He had gripped me by the biceps with his single hand, and when that grip tightened I wilted and shrieked aloud. My feet went <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me.</b> I simply could not stand upright and endure the agony. The muscles refused their duty. The pain was too great. My biceps was being crushed to a pulp.|$|E
6000|$|But {{to return}} to the Snark, and why I, for one, want to journey in her around the world. The things I like {{constitute}} my set of values. The thing I like most of all is personal achievement--not achievement for the world's applause, but achievement for my own delight. It is the old [...] "I did it! I did it! With my own hands I did it!" [...] But personal achievement, with me, must be concrete. I'd rather win a water-fight in the swimming pool, or remain astride a horse that is trying to get <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> than write the great American novel. Each man to his liking. Some other fellow would prefer writing the great American novel to winning the water-fight or mastering the horse.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I'll {{never see}} Anna, or Tom Pinfold, or old Yeo, or Pincher, or you, ever any more?" [...] In {{this moment of}} the {{crumbling}} <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me</b> of all my footholds I would have clung even to that dry tuft, Mrs. Fursey herself.|$|R
60|$|It was a feat {{to travel}} the narrow halls. Time and again I paused and held on until my finger-tips hurt. In the moments of {{easement}} I made progress. Yet I miscalculated. The foot of the broad stairway to the chart-house rested on a cross-hall a dozen feet in length. Over-confidence and an unusually violent antic of the Elsinore caused the disaster. She flung down to starboard with such suddenness and at such a pitch that the flooring seemed to go <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me</b> and I hustled helplessly down the incline. I missed a frantic clutch at the newel-post, flung up my arm in time to save my face, and, most fortunately, whirled half about, and, still falling, impacted with my shoulder muscle-pad on Captain West's door.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was too}} late. I sprang {{toward the}} rigging, to which I might have clung, and was met by the {{descending}} wall of water. What happened after that was very confusing. I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning. My feet were <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> and I was turning {{over and over and}} being swept along I knew not where. Several times I collided against hard objects, once striking my right knee a terrible blow. Then the flood seemed suddenly to subside and I was breathing the good air again. I had been swept against the galley and around the steerage companion-way from the weather side into the lee scuppers. The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing. I could not put my weight on it, or, at least, I thought I could not put my weight on it; and I felt sure the leg was broken. But the cook was after me, shouting through the lee galley door: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was when}} I got my crack at Bill Isbel," [...] {{declared}} Colter, with grim satisfaction. [...] "When they shot my horse <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me</b> I had Ellen {{to think of}} an' couldn't get my rifle. Shore had to run, as yu seen. Wal, as I only had my six-shooter, there was nothin' {{for me to do}} but lay low an' listen to the sping of lead. Wells was standin' up behind a tree about thirty yards off. He got plugged, an' fallin' over he began to crawl my way, still holdin' to his rifle. I crawled along the log to meet him. But he dropped aboot half-way. I went on an' took his rifle an' belt. When I peeped out from behind a spruce bush then I seen Bill Isbel. He was shootin' fast, an' all of them was shootin' fast. That war, when they had the open shot at Slater.... Wal, I bored Bill Isbel right through his middle. He dropped his rifle an', all bent double, he fooled around in a circle till he flopped over the Rim. I reckon he's layin' right up there somewhere below that daid spruce. I'd shore like to see him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did n't fly off the handle," [...] {{said the}} screw, twirling huskily {{at the end}} of the screw-shaft. [...] "If I had, you'd have been {{scrap-iron}} by this time. The sea dropped away <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> and I had nothing to catch on to. That's all." ...|$|R

5000|$|Filming {{proved to}} be {{dangerous}} at times. Margaret Hamilton was severely burned in the Munchkinland scene. A concealed elevator {{was supposed to take}} her down while a bit of fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran like clockwork; however, in the DVD commentary, Hamilton states, [...] "I had to stand on this dual elevator, that went down slowly or went down fast, and in this case it dropped <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> it left my feet and I followed it." [...] The fire and smoke then erupted. However, for the second take, the timing was off, and Hamilton was exposed to the flames. The grease in her copper-based makeup caught fire and had to be completely and quickly removed before the ensuing second-degree burns on her hands and face could be treated. After spending six weeks in the hospital convalescing, she returned to filming.|$|E
5000|$|Solium Infernum {{failed to}} receive much {{attention}} from the mainstream gaming press, with few publications following the game or publishing reviews; however it was met with critical acclaim from independent journalists and gaming blogs. Quintin Smith was highly enthusiastic towards Solium Infernum, writing in Eurogamer that it [...] "kicked my knees <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me.</b> It's unlike anything I've ever played" [...] and stating in his GameSetWatch column [...] "more than any game I've played in years Solium Infernum nails the sensation of staring at a screen and losing yourself in the cold glory of a difficult decision." [...] Rock, Paper, Shotgun covered the game heavily, dedicating a large series of posts to a turn-by-turn review of the multiplayer mode, with Kieron Gillen calling Solium Infernum [...] "one of 2009’s most intriguing, subtle and just plain best games." [...] PC Gamer gave Solium Infernum 85%.|$|E

5000|$|His {{first solo}} single, [...] "Blues Get Off My Shoulder", was {{recorded}} in 1958, {{while he was still}} working primarily with Williams' band. The B-side, [...] "You Got What It Takes", also written by Parker, was later recorded for Motown by Marv Johnson, but with the songwriting credited to Berry Gordy, Gwen Fuqua and Roquel Davis. Parker told the Forgotten Hits newsletter in 2008:"I wrote 'You've Got What It Takes,' that was MY song. Even had the Paul Hucklebuck Williams band playing on it behind me... And then Berry Gordy just stole it <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me,</b> just put his name on it. And what could I do? I was just trying to make a living, playing guitar and singing, how was I going to go on and fight Berry Gordy, big as he was, and Motown Records? There wasn't really nothing I could do about it - it was just too big and I didn't have any way to fight them..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim Wynorski was {{originally}} meant to direct {{and wrote a}} screenplay with R.J. Robertson for producer Sylvio Tabet. Wynorski later said:We wrote him a helluva good screenplay. Then at the last moment, he pulls the rug <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>me</b> and says he’s directing it himself. And then tops it off by threatening to take our writing credits off the picture. I took the bastard straight to court. He hired big time attorneys to stall paying out the final script installments. I hated his guts. But I got the last laugh when Republic Pictures picked up the show. They wanted a picture totally clean of legal entanglements. So they came to {{me to make a}} deal and I held them up but good. Cleaned up. I still remember Tabet’s pained face when I told him {{what it would take to}} get me to sign off. Even my own lawyer whined!Shooting locations include Glen Canyon and Antelope Canyon. [...] Director and co-writer Sylvio Tabet was a producer on the original film. [...] Andre Norton's novel The Beast Master was credited as an inspiration. After reading the first film's screenplay, Norton had her credit removed, but her agent talked her into allowing it for the sequel.|$|E
