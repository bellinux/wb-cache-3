5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration, with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004.

5000|$|Various {{agencies}} {{have tried to}} estimate how long these primary resources will last, assuming a once-through cycle. The European Commission said in 2001 that at {{the current level of}} uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide {{only a fraction of the}} world’s energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years. The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of US$130/kg according to the industry groups Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<b>OECD),</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> (NEA) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are enough to last for [...] "at least a century" [...] at current consumption rates. According to the World Nuclear Association, yet another industry group, assuming the world's current rate of consumption at 66,500 tonnes of uranium per year and the world's present measured resources of uranium (4.7 Mt - 5.5 Mt) are enough to last for some 70-80 years.|$|E
