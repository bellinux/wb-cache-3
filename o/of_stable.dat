As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II).

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E

5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E

5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.

5|$|Ancient Egypt was {{a civilization}} of ancient Northeastern Africa, {{concentrated}} along the lower {{reaches of the}} Nile River in the place that is now the country Egypt. It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).

40|$|The aim of {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to assess}} impact stabling technology on milk production and economy of breeding of Czech Fleckvieh cattle in three economic cooperatives with a different type <b>of</b> <b>stabling</b> technology. The first section was devoted to literary review; we focused {{on the characteristics of}} the Czech Fleckvieh cattle, then on technology <b>of</b> <b>stabling</b> and economy <b>of</b> breeding. In the practical part, we are pursuing three selected farms in terms of milk production and the economics of farming. Compared to obtained data, the volume of fat, protein, somatic cells and total amount of microorganisms in milk, costs connected with the technology <b>of</b> <b>stabling</b> and other costs connected with the breeding of dairy cattle. Based on the results the most economical technology for breeding of dairy cattle was evaluated. Out of the farms in scope came out best the farm with boxes and straw. Milk production was 20. 5 kg of milk per cow a day, with satisfactory quantity and content of milk components. From the economic point of view it has the lowest total cost <b>of</b> <b>stabling</b> cows. The results of bachelor thesis will serve to the monitored farms, as an example of strengths and weaknesses of their technology <b>of</b> <b>stabling...</b>|$|R
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production <b>of</b> <b>stable</b> micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E

Two logit models were used to determine the factors that contribute to or inhibit adoption <b>of</b> <b>stabling.</b> The variables that were found to be significant were: the household's herd size, the number of economically active household members, access to extension information, the education level of the household head, access to credit and farm size.
