5|$|There {{have been}} 19 {{managers}} {{in the history of}} the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League. Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, Lou Piniella has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001. Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team into the playoffs, with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season. None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19. Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|The popes, {{and also}} the Senate when it coined money, appear to have used the {{imperial}} mint of Rome, which was on {{the slope of the}} Campidoglio, not far from the Arch of Septimius Severus; but in the fifteenth century the mint was near the bank of Santo Spirito. Finally, in 1665, Alexander VII moved it {{to the rear of the}} apse of St. Peter's. Bernini invented for it a machine to do the work more rapidly, and Francesco Girardini furnished a very sensitive balance; so that the mint of Rome was technically the most perfect <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times.</b> In 1845 Pius IX equipped it with the most modern appliances.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E
5000|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson of hip hop band The Roots acted as the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of the}} collective's {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including The Roots' Things Fall Apart (1999), D'Angelo's Voodoo (2000), Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000), and Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000). In an interview for Spin magazine, Common discussed the production <b>of</b> <b>those</b> albums, stating [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>time</b> periods that you don't even realize when you're going through it that it's powerful".|$|R

5000|$|Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band's best songs, ranked it as number seven, commenting, [...] "Without {{delving into}} {{unnecessary}} details, the lyrics hint at an abusive household and a prospect of romantic longing that serves no purpose beyond {{the promise of}} 'something new.' Blink often suffered from spelling out its themes, but 'Dick Lips' represents <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>times</b> they simply let the song speak for itself." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon, want to take things slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be 'the one'. This song is about <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> when your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens {{wrote to}} Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was {{practical}} on coins struck at the Mint. [...] Shaw {{did not immediately}} reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote {{that there was no}} objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, [...] "as artistic as the Greeks could desire". Roosevelt secured Shaw's support for the redesign, although as the President wrote to Saint-Gaudens, [...] "of course he thinks I am a crack-brained lunatic on the subject". [...] Shaw wrote to the sculptor on , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned, [...] "the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief", but as the President disagreed with Roberts's view, Saint-Gaudens could go ahead with a high-relief design. [...] Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented, [...] "This is also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> when the compelling egos of artist and President might have paid greater attention to director Roberts' comments. [...] By continuing with the design in a relief that was not coinable, Saint-Gaudens lost his best chance to explore the limits of artistry on circulation coinage." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who {{had been}} {{overseeing}} the Paris installation, was {{brought back to the}} US to manage [...] the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States. He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 [...] "field engineers" [...] struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder, Thomas Alva Edison, only a couple of times. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison who made a quip about their [...] "Parisian" [...] being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that [...] "this is a damned good man." [...] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp–based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, the {{relation}} between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel {{that he was being}} denied due credit for his own [...] "first steps" [...] in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France {{in the aftermath of the}} Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion's decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the lettre he was offended by the fact that he himself was mentioned only twice, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name [...] "Berenice". Young was further disheartened by the fact that Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion, and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the lettre Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion's decipherments merely as an extension of Åkerblad and Young's work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review, while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author's original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion, he complained that [...] "however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, I admit them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, not by any means as superseding my system, but as fully confirming and extending it."(p.146).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{parcels of}} land held under the village tenureship system {{are known as}} patis and a patidar is the holder <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> allotments.

5000|$|The {{words were}} a shared vision of Lawlor and Blake, and recall their {{childhood}} neighborhoods {{and those who}} grew up with them. It was a universal longing for youth, yesteryear, and place, although it was also idealized because both Lawlor and Blake had grown up quite poor. Lawlor said that he envisioned a [...] "big husky policeman leaning against a lamppost and twirling his club, an organ grinder playing nearby, and the east side kids with dirty faces, shoes unlaced, stockings down, torn clothes, dancing to the music, while from a tenement window an old Irish woman with a checkered cap and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> old <b>time</b> checkered shawls around her shoulders, looking down and smiling at the children." [...] The children's names in the lyrics were <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Blake's childhood friends.

30|$|The {{decomposition}} of students’ fraction concepts into {{the coordination of}} underlying mental actions {{has its roots in}} Piaget’s (1972) genetic epistemology. In that epistemology, mathematics is a product of psychology—derived from mental actions that are characterized by their composability and reversibility. For example, mental actions of partitioning and iterating can be composed with one another and can be considered as inverses <b>of</b> <b>one</b> another: the mental action of partitioning a continuous whole into n parts can be composed with the mental action <b>of</b> iterating <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> parts n <b>times,</b> and the result is the original whole (Wilkins and Norton 2011). Coordinations of mental actions like these form group-like structures that complement the sequential structures of schemes.|$|R

Magdalen thought {{of the rules of}} convents forbidding the appropriation of personal trifles, and wondered if it were wise, if stern; but for the present she decided that it could not be her duty to risk what had been carefully and kindly selected for her in unpractised and careless hands; and she further compromised the matter by reckoning whether her funds, which were not excessive, would admit of the hire or purchase of machines that might allay the burning aspirations of her young people.|$|R
50|$|As Newtonian {{views of}} time show it flowing linearly, Einsteinian views show it as a {{function}} of matter and energy; change <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> quantities and <b>time</b> too is changed. Xenakis attempted to make this distinction in his music. While most traditional compositions depend on strictly measured time for the progress of the line, using an unvarying tempo, time signature, or phrase length, Metastaseis changes intensity, register, and density of scoring, as the musical analogues of mass and energy. It is by these changes that the piece propels itself forward: the first and third movements of the work do not have even a melodic theme or motive to hold them together, but rather depend on the strength of this conceptualization of time.|$|R

5000|$|Scriptwriters capitalised on {{the rivalry}} between the {{characters}} when, in 1986, Mike married Ken's daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed. Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs {{has suggested that}} they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike's maltreatment of his daughter. Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, [...] "It was a classic - Baldwin getting {{it in his own}} territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>times</b> he caught Mike off-guard." [...] Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house. Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.|$|R
