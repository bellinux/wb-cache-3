40|$|Background: Although <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is used {{clinically}} as an anticholinergic drug (i. e., parasympathetic antagonist) {{to relax}} airway smooth muscle, we examined {{whether it has}} or {{does not have any}} effects on diaphragm muscle. Methods: Three treatment sets, an <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhalation only group, an <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhalation plus endotoxin injection group (in vivo) and an <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> incubation group (in vitro) were studied as to diaphragm muscle contractile properties. Results: <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhalation shifted force-frequency curves upward at 2 h after inhalation (p < 0. 05) and inhibited the decrease of force-frequency curves due to endotoxin injection in vivo. Incubation with <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> of untreated diaphragm muscle and diaphragm muscle injected with endotoxin did not increase the force-frequency curves dose-dependently in vitro; however, it caused both types of muscle to be fatigue resistant. Conclusions: We speculate that the increment of muscle contractility with the inhalation of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> was induced by the antagonization of musucarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). In addition, the changes of fatigue resistance provoked by <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> which also is speculated to antagonize mAChR, may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with COPD...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{efficacy}} of the addition of inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in combination with inhaled corticosteroids {{in the treatment of}} elderly asthmatic patients whose asthma is not well controlled was evaluated. A randomized, open-label cross-over trial comparing 4 -week treatment periods with and without regular inhalation of 200 μg of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> four times per day was performed. Twenty-four patients (mean age±SD: 62 ± 7 years) completed the study. The dose of beclomethasone dipropionate in this patient group was 1300 ± 800 μg/day. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was significantly improved after treatment with regular inhalation of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> when compared with FEV 1 after treatment without oxitropium (1. 73 ± 0. 60 vs 1. 63 ± 0. 68). Both morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were significantly greater during the treatment period with regular inhalation of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The score for dyspnea/chest tightness was also significantly improved during the <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> period. There was no statistically significant improvement in forced vital capacity, scores for other symptoms or the frequency of rescue inhalation of fenoterol. The results of this study demonstrated that the addition of regular inhalation of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is beneficial in elderly asthmatics whose asthma is not well controlled, even when treated with high-dose inhaled steroids...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the influence of}} higher than conventional doses of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> on formoterol-induced bronchodilation in patients with partially reversible stable COPD. Twenty outpatients inhaled one or two puffs of formoterol (12 μg puff− 1), or placebo. Two hours after inhalation, a dose-response curve to inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (100 μg puff− 1) or placebo was constructed using one puff, one puff, two puffs and two puffs, for a total cumulative dose of 600 μg <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Doses were given at 20 -min intervals and measurements made 15 min after each dose. On six separate days, all patients received one of the following: (1) formoterol 12 μg + <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 600 μg, (2) formoterol 12 μg + placebo, (3) formoterol 24 μg + <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 600 μg, (4) formoterol 24 μg + placebo, (5) placebo + <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 600 μg, or (6) placebo + placebo. Both formoterol 12 μg and 24 μg induced a good bronchodilation (formoterol 12 μg, 0 · 19 – 0 · 20 1; formoterol 24 μg 0 · 22 – 0 · 24 1). The dose-response curve of oxitropium, but not placebo, showed an evident increase in FEV 1, with a further significant increase of respectively 0 · 087 1 and 0 · 082 1 after the formoterol 12 μg and formoterol 24 μg pre-treatment. This study shows that improved pulmonary function in patients with stable COPD may be achieved by adding oxitropium 400 – 600 μg to formoterol. There is not much difference in bronchodilation between combining oxitropium with formoterol 12 μg or 24 μg. In any case, formoterol 24 μg alone seems sufficient {{to achieve the same}} bronchodilation induced by oxitropium 600 μg alone in most patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Anticholinergic {{bronchodilator}} drugs improve {{lung function}} in chronic bronchitis but less {{is known of}} their effects on the volume and physical properties of sputum in conditions associated with excessive airway secretions. This study examines {{the effects of the}} regular use of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in such patients. METHODS [...] The study was conducted in a parallel, double blind, placebo controlled fashion. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group (n = 17) received <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> from a metered dose inhaler (two puffs three times daily; 100 micrograms/puff) for eight weeks, and the second group (n = 16) received placebo. Lung function was measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and vital capacity. In evaluating airway secretion, daily amount of expectorated sputum, percentage solid composition, viscoelastic properties including elastic modulus and dynamic viscosity, and sputum microbiology were determined. RESULTS [...] <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> increased FEV 1 and decreased the mean (SE) sputum production from 61 (4) to 42 (3) g/day after treatment, whereas placebo had no effect. Bacterial density and sputum flora were unchanged, but solid composition and elastic modulus increased from 2. 52 (0. 43) % to 3. 12 (0. 34) %, and 68 (12) dyne/cm 2, respectively, in the group taking <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Regular treatment with <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> not only improves airflow limitation but also reduces sputum production, probably through the inhibition of both mucus secretion and water transport, the latter component being predominant...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnti-cholinergic {{agents are}} {{considered}} the bronchodilator therapy of first-choice {{in the treatment of}} patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with heart disease since they may be as effective or more effective than inhaled β 2 -agonists and, moreover, they do not interact with cardiac β -adrenoceptors. The aim of our study was to evaluate the bronchodilator activity of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in outpatients suffering from exacerbations of COPD associated with heart diseases (ischaemic heart disease and/or arrhythmias). We recruited 50 consecutive outpatients (33 males and 17 females, mean age 68 · 6 years, 15 current smokers and 35 ex-smokers). Each patient performed body plethismography in basal condition and 30 min after inhalation of 200 μg metered dose inhaler (MDI) <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> administered by a device (Fluspacer®). FEV 1, FVC, MMEF 25 - 75, sRaw and tRaw were evaluated.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Inhaled anticholinergics and beta {{agonists}} {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, dosage requirements have not been thoroughly evaluated and comparative dose-response data for these agents are limited. METHODS [...] Twenty men with stable COPD of mean (SD) age 69. 4 (5. 8) years and FEV 1 0. 93 (0. 38) litres were studied in randomised, double blind, crossover, placebo controlled experiments. All of the patients received two, four, eight, and 16 puffs of ipratropium bromide (20 micrograms/puff), flutropium bromide (30 micrograms/puff), <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (100 micrograms/puff), fenoterol (200 micrograms/puff), or placebo in random order on five separate days. Doses were administered by a metered dose inhaler at intervals of 60 minutes to give cumulative doses of two, six, 14, and 30 puffs. Five mg of nebulised salbutamol was administered 60 minutes after the patient had received the final 16 puffs of each regimen. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), heart rate, and blood pressure were measured five minutes before each treatment and 30 minutes after treatment with nebulised salbutamol. RESULTS [...] FEV 1 and FVC reached a plateau after administration of a cumulative dose of 14 puffs of ipratropium bromide (280 micrograms) or flutropium bromide (420 micrograms), and after six puffs of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (600 micrograms). There were no differences with respect to maximum increases in FEV 1 and FVC amongst the three anticholinergic agents. However, after six puffs <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> produced a greater increase in FEV 1 than either ipratropium bromide or flutropium bromide. Fenoterol caused a greater increase in both FEV 1 and FVC than the three anticholinergic agents after six puffs, as well as a greater increase in pulse rate. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> produced a greater increase in pulse rate than the other anticholinergics after 14 puffs. The incidence of side effects was dose-related and notable adverse effects were reported after 30 puffs of ipratropium bromide, 14 puffs of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and two puffs of fenoterol. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> produced a greater bronchodilator effect than either ipratropium bromide or flutropium bromide when used at doses of less than six puffs, without apparent side effects. There were, however, no differences in maximal response between these drugs. Fenoterol may have a greater peak bronchodilator effect than the anticholinergic agents but it causes more adverse effects, even at lower doses. Depending upon the balance between efficacy and side effects, <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> may be preferred in the treatment of patients with COPD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnti-cholinergic {{agents are}} {{generally}} regarded as the bronchodilator therapy of first choice {{in the treatment of}} stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), considering that they may be more effective than in inhaled β 2 -agonist. However, results of the authors' recent studies conflict to some extent with this suggestion because they demonstrate that this is true only for short acting β 2 -agonists but not for long-acting β 2 -agonists. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is an anti-cholinergic drug that has been shown to produce a similar degree of bronchodilation to that obtained with ipratropium bromide, but with a longer-lasting effect. In the present study, the time course of inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> bronchodilation in comparison to that of inhaled salmeterol in a group of patients with partially reversible COPD was evaluated. Twelve male patients with moderate to severe COPD participated in the study. The study had a single-bind, cross-over, randomized design. The bronchodilator activity of 50 μg salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate, 200 and 400 μg <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> and placebo, which were all inhaled from a metered-dose inhaler, was investigated on several non-consecutive days. The highest FVC and FEV 1, obtained from {{one or the other of}} the reproducible curves, were kept for analysis. Measurements were performed at the following times: immediately before inhalation of treatment, and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 480, 600 and 720 min after inhalation of the individual treatment. Salmeterol tended to have a delayed time to peak effect, but had a longer duration of effect than oxitropium. The response to salmeterol exceeded the response to 200 μg oxitropium for 12 h, but its responses were significantly (P< 0 · 05) greater than those to 200 μg oxitropium from 10 to 12 h. From 3 to 12 h, salmeterol also surpassed 400 μg oxitropium but differences were not significant (P< 0 · 05). The mean FEV 1 area under the curve was significantly (P< 0 · 05) larger after salmeterol when compared to 200 μg <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> but there was no significant difference (P< 0 · 05) between salmeterol and 400 μg <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> No significant changes in pulse rate, blood pressure or electrocardiograms were found among the four groups as compared with placebo group. These findings confirm and extend what has been demonstrated by the authors' previous studies, and show that salmeterol compares conveniently with anti-cholinergic drugs in terms of effects on lung function at clinically recommended doses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that corticosteroid treatment might improve bronchodilator responses in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). We have studied bronchodilator responses to salbutamol and to <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in 20 patients with stable {{moderate to severe}} COPD. Dose responses to the two bronchodilators were tested before and after 3 week courses of placebo and 30 mg prednisolone. Thirteen patients were taking inhaled corticosteroids. There were no significant changes in numbers of responses or maximum bronchodilator effects from either bronchodilator, although there was a trend towards higher maximum levels after 3 weeks of prednisolone. Spirometry measured at home each morning before and after <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> showed no difference between prednisolone and placebo periods.

40|$|Breathlessness {{and limited}} {{exercise}} tolerance {{are the principal}} symptoms of COPD. Bronchodilator therapy is directed towards the relief of these disabling symptoms but little is known of the mechanism of relief of dyspnoea or which tests best predict symptomatic benefit from bronchodilator. This thesis examines the appropriateness {{of a range of}} radiological and physiological tests in assessing disease severity and the symptomatic benefit derived from bronchodilators and examines the physiological mechanisms which result in reduced dyspnoea following their use. The estimation of lung volume radiographically was disappointing and was only comparable with other methods for group data. Agreement within individual patients was poor. My data suggests that radiological measures of lung volume are unsuitable for individual patient studies but it may still be useful in retrospective epidemiological studies where other lung volume data is not available. Inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> and nebulised salbutamol both improved 6 minute walking distance, the improvement in exercise capacity being independent of improvements in FEVl or FVC. Resting breathlessness was significantly improved by both oxitropium and salbutamol, whilst end of walk breathlessness was improved following oxitropium. Both these measures of improvement were independent of spirometric improvement. However increases in peak inspiratory flow rate after <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> correlated significantly with improvements in end of walk breathlessness. Improvements in breathlessness and walking distance were not explained by reductions in lung volume measured either by helium dilution or body plethysmography. Trapped gas volume proved to be an unreliable measurement and had no value in the prediction of functional benefit from bronchodilator. Large falls in resting airways resistance occured in these COPD patients following <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The falls in airways resistance occurred independently of improvements in spirometry but were not quantitively related to improvements in either breathlessness or 6 minute walking distance. Mouth occlusion pressure was not a correlate of resting breathlessness neither did changes in PO. l correlate with reductions in breathlessness. The presence of severe airflow obstruction and PEEPi make the measurement of mouth occlusion pressure suspect in these patients. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> caused a small fall in resting oxygen saturation, salbutamol had no effect on resting saturation. Corridor walking exercise produced brisk falls in oxygen saturation, but the severity of desaturation was unaffected by the bronchodilator. Recovery from desaturation {{at the end of the}} walk was rapid. Histamine challenge increased breathlessness but alterations in levels of breathlessness were not correlated with the increases in end expiratory lung volume provoked by the challenge. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> reduced positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi), respiratory accessory muscle activity and reduced pleural pressure swings during hypoxia and hypercapnia stimulated breathing. Thus the efficiency of ventilation was improved by their inhaled bronchodilator. There was no difference in the rate of change of breathlessness with increasing ventilation between isocapnic hypoxaemic and progressive hypercapnic stimulated breathing. In conclusion an anticholinergic bronchodilator can improve exercise capacity and breathlessness, independent of changes in conventional lung function tests or alterations in oxygen saturation. Alterations in these measurements which relate to dynamic changes occuring during respiration such as PEEPi, accessory muscle activity and pleural pressure swings may be more useful in assessing the response to bronchodilator drugs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—An {{earlier study}} {{documented}} that, {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), addition of ipratropium bromide at the clinically recommended dose (40 µg) does not produce any further bronchodilation than that achieved with salmeterol 50 µg alone. However, the dose of ipratropium bromide needed to produce near maximal bronchodilation is several times higher than the customary dosage. The full therapeutic potential of combined salmeterol plus an anticholinergic drug can therefore only be established using doses higher than those currently recommended in the marketing of these agents. A study was undertaken to examine the possible acute effects of higher than conventional doses of an anticholinergic agent on the single dose salmeterol induced bronchodilation in patients with stable and partially reversible COPD.  METHODS—Thirty two outpatients received 50 µg salmeterol or placebo. Two hours after inhalation a dose-response curve to inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (100 µg/puff) or placebo was constructed using one puff, one puff, two puffs, and two puffs—that is, a total cumulative dose of 600 µg <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Dose increments were given at 20 minute intervals with measurements being made 15 minutes after each dose. On four separate days all patients received one of the following: (1) 50 µg salmeterol + 600 µg oxitropium bromide; (2) 50 µg salmeterol + placebo; (3) placebo + 600 µg oxitropium bromide; (4) placebo +placebo.  RESULTS—Salmeterol induced a good bronchodilation (mean increase 0. 272 l; 95 % CI 0. 207 to 0. 337) two hours after its inhalation. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> elicited an evident dose-dependent increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and this occurred also after pretreatment with salmeterol with a further mean maximum increase of 0. 152 l (95 % CI of differences 0. 124 to 0. 180).  CONCLUSIONS—This study shows that acute pretreatment with 50 µg salmeterol does not block the possibility of inducing more bronchodilation with an anticholinergic agent when a higher than normal dosage of the muscarinic antagonist is used. ...|$|E
30|$|Mucoregulatory agents inhibit mucus {{production}} or mucus secretion. Anticholinergic medications {{are the most}} well studied agents in this class. Anticholinergics can reduce the volume of stimulated secretions without increasing viscosity [63]. The topical anticholinergic bronchodilator, <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> {{has been shown to}} decrease the volume of secretions in patients with chronic bronchitis without changing mucus viscoelasticity [64]. The long-acting anticholinergic agent, tiotropium bromide, has kinetic selectivity for both the M 1 and M 3 receptor types over the M 2 (auto-inhibitory) receptor [63]. In one study with COPD patients without exacerbations, tiotropium bromide treatment did not improve tracheobronchial clearance when compared with placebo [65].|$|E
40|$|Bronchodilators, {{generally}} administered via metered dose or {{dry powder}} inhalers, are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and anticholinergics are the bronchodilators primarily {{used in the}} chronic treatment of COPD. Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over betaagonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies. Their therapeutic efficacy {{is based on the}} fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. However, bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction, which by definition is limited, as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction. Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide, <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> and tiotropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide, the prototype of anticholinergic bronchodilators, is a short-acting agent. <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is administered twice a day. Tiotropium bromide, the only long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) currently approved, is administered once a day. Newer LAMAs including aclidinium bromide and glycopyrrolate bromide are currently in phase III development for treatment of COPD. Some new LAMAs, including glycocpyrrolate, are suitable for once daily administration and, unlike tiotropium, have a rapid onset of action. New LAMAs and their combination with ultra-LABA and, possibly, inhaled corticosteroids, seem to open new perspectives in the management of COPD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostaglandin (PG) D 2 is {{a potent}} bronchoconstrictor {{mediator}} and is found, together with leukotriene (LT) D 4, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the early response to allergen challenge in asthmatic subjects. The potency of PGD 2 has not been established in normal and atopic non-asthmatic subjects, nor has the contribution of cholinergic mechanisms to PGD 2 induced bronchoconstriction in normal subjects. Mediators released simultaneously may interact, so the effect of pre-inhalation of LTD 4 on PGD 2 responsiveness was investigated. METHODS: Six normal and six atopic non-asthmatic subjects performed histamine and PGD 2 challenges on separate occasions. Eight normal subjects performed PGD 2 challenges immediately before and 45 minutes after inhalation of 200 micrograms <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> or placebo. Bronchial responsiveness to PGD 2 was established in six normal subjects immediately after pretreatment with saline or non-bronchoconstricting doses of methacholine or LTD 4 (challenge 1), and again at six hours (challenge 2). All studies were performed in a double blind, randomised, crossover fashion. RESULTS: PGD 2 was 25 -fold and 18 -fold more potent as a bronchoconstrictor than histamine in atopic non-asthmatic and normal subjects, respectively. Responsiveness (PC 35 sGaw) to histamine and PGD 2 correlated significantly (r = 0. 917, n = 12, p < 0. 001). <b>Oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in a dose of 200 micrograms inhibited PGD 2 induced bronchoconstriction by 37. 5 %, although in two of these subjects no inhibition was seen. Pre- inhalation of LTD 4 and methacholine shifted the dose-response curve of PGD 2 to the left by 4. 6 -fold and 2. 4 -fold, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PGD 2 {{is a potent}} bronchoconstrictor in normal subjects, which is partly mediated by cholinergic mechanisms in some subjects. No significant interaction was found between LTD 4 and PGD 2 in six normal subjects. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although {{exercise}} induced desaturation {{can occur}} in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), little is known about its frequency during everyday exercise, or how it relates to dyspnoea or prior drug treatment. METHODS [...] The effects of 200 micrograms inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> an anticholinergic bronchodilator drug, on spirometric values, dyspnoea score, and oxygen saturation during corridor walking and cycle ergometry were studied in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study. RESULTS [...] Oxitropium produced a small increase in forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) from 0. 76 (0. 28) 1 to 0. 93 (0. 69) 1 and in six minute walking distance from 311 (93) m to 332 (86) m, but did not change progressive cycle exercise duration. Resting and end exercise breathlessness levels were reduced in both forms of exercise after oxitropium. Resting oxygen saturation fell significantly after active bronchodilator from 92. 9 % (3. 7 %) to 92. 0 % (4. 1 %) but the nadir saturation during exercise was unchanged. The patients desaturated more during corridor walking than cycle ergometry [walking 7. 8 % (4. 4 %), cycle ergometry 2. 1 % (2. 1 %) ]. Baseline walking distance was related to FVC, resting breathlessness and resting oxygen saturation (multiple r 2 = 0. 46) but only resting saturation correlated with end exercise breathlessness (r 2 = - 0. 25). Improvements in symptoms or exercise performance after oxitropium could not be predicted by changes in spirometric indices or oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS [...] In patients with COPD arterial oxygen desaturation during self-paced walking is common, of greater severity than that during cycle ergometry, but is unaffected by inhaled <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The factors that predict initial performance are not appropriate markers of functional improvement after an active bronchodilator drug...|$|E

Thirteen patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (FEV 1, 32 – 75 %pred) and 10 patients with asthma (FEV 1, 43 – 75 %pred) inhaled either 200 *μ g fenoterol or 200 *μ g <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> or placebo, each of them on three occasions, on nine different days in a randomised, cross-over, double-blind fashion. Forced expiratory (FEV 1) and inspiratory (FIV 1) volumes were measured before and 30 *min after inhalation. In patients with COPD, the increase in FEV 1 (coefficient of variation) was 221 *ml (43 %) after fenoterol and 235 *ml (33 %) after oxitropium; changes in FIV 1 were 301 *ml (45 %) and 360 *ml (29 %). In patients with asthma, FEV 1 improved by 618 *ml (26 %) and 482 *ml (25 %), FIV 1 by 553 *ml (41 %) and 475 *ml (23 %). In less severe COPD or asthma, the reduction in dyspnoea was associated with the improvements in both FIV 1 and FEV 1, but in severe COPD with the improvement in FIV 1 only. The data demonstrate that, at least in terms of relative changes, the reproducibility of bronchodilator responses in terms of FIV 1 is similar to that of FEV 1 and they underline the assertion of FIV 1 being a sensible parameter particularly in severe COPD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo study {{whether it}} would be {{possible}} to assess anticholinergic drugs in normal subjects with histamine-(HIST) induced bronchoconstriction, three doses of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (100, 200 and 400 μg) was inhaled in random order by twelve normal volunteers in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study. Dose response slope [DRS = maximal percentual fall in pulmonary function/maximal noncumulative histamine dose (μmol) ] was used as an index of bronchial reactivity, and was calculated for FEV 1 (DRSFEV 1) and area under the flow-volume curve (DRSAEFV). The bronchial reactivity and its reproducibility was first tested with a standard provocation method. An abbreviated, single-dose, method was used in the measurement of the effects of oxitropium. The reproducibility of HIST-provocations were good with intraclass correlations of 0 · 97 and 0 · 99 for logDRSFEV 1 and logDRSAEFV, respectively. However, DRSAEFV seemed to be better in this respect as DRSFEV 1. Also, the single-dose method gave results that were comparable to the standard one. The largest dose of oxitropium diminished the median DRS from 2 · 6 to 0 · 01 and from 5 · 2 to − 0 · 2 for FEV 1 and AEFV, respectively. All oxitropium doses differed significantly from placebo (P< 0 · 01) and from each other (P< 0 · 05) with DRSAEFV-values, but when DRSFEV 1 was used, a significant difference was detected only between placebo and active treatment (P< 0 · 01). In conclusion, since the vagal mechanisms seem to be the predominant system mediating HIST-induced bronchoconstriction in normal subjects, it is possible with DRSAEFV to evaluate the efficacy of anticholinergics against HIST-induced bronchoconstriction in these subjects...|$|E

Tiotropium bromide is a recently introduced long-acting anticholinergic agent able to reduce dyspnoea and COPD exacerbations and to improve pulmonary function and quality of life. We designed a study to compare the short-term efficacy of tiotropium bromide with that of <b>oxitropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in improving pulmonary function in patients with COPD. MethodsEighty patients were randomized either to continue oxitropium 800 mcg/day or to receive tiotropium 18 mcg/day. Seventy-six (39 in the tiotropium and 37 in the oxitropium group) completed the study. Plethysmography was performed at baseline and after 72 h in all patients. The changes in functional parameters in the two groups were compared by the Mann–Whitney U-test. ResultsThere were no {{differences between the two groups}} regarding age (72. 5 vs. 74. 2 years), male/female ratio (25 / 14 vs. 23 / 14) and pulmonary function at baseline. The changes in spirometric parameters were significantly greater in tiotropium- than in oxitropium-treated patients: mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) increased significantly by 15 % vs. 3 % (P= 0. 017), mean FVC by 10. 5 % vs. 2. 2 % (P= 0. 044), and FEF 25, 50, and 75 by 34 % vs. 14 % (P< 0. 05), 33 % vs. 7 % (P< 0. 05), and 50 % vs. 6 % (P< 0. 0001), respectively; mean FRC and RV decreased nonsignificantly by 7. 5 % and 10 % with tiotropium vs. 4. 3 % and 6. 5 % with oxitropium, respectively. ConclusionThe replacement of oxitropium with tiotropium significantly increases pulmonary function in patients with COPD. The improvement involves also small airways that have not been investigated thus far...|$|E
