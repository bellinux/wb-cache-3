40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} identify the dynamic health of shearer, reducing <b>operating</b> <b>trouble</b> and production accident of shearer and improving coal production efficiency further, a dynamic health assessment approach for shearer based on artificial immune algorithm was proposed. The key {{technologies such as}} system framework, selecting the indicators for shearer dynamic health assessment, and health assessment model were provided, and the flowchart of the proposed approach was designed. A simulation example, with an accuracy of 96 %, based on the collected data from industrial production scene was provided. Furthermore, the comparison demonstrated that the proposed method exhibited higher classification accuracy than the classifiers based on back propagation-neural network (BP-NN) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Finally, the proposed approach was applied in an engineering problem of shearer dynamic health assessment. The industrial application {{results showed that the}} paper research achievements could be used combining with shearer automation control system in fully mechanized coal face.

40|$|On May 4, 2005, a 42 -year-old Guatemalan tree-service worker {{died after}} he was caught and pulled into a brush chipper. The victim was a day laborer {{who had worked for}} the tree service for {{approximately}} two weeks. On the day of the incident, the victim and his employer, the tree service owner, were trimming trees behind a residence. The owner had climbed a tree and was cutting branches and passing them down to the victim; the victim then fed the limbs through the brush chipper. After passing a few limbs to the victim, the owner heard the victim yelling and saw that he was being pulled into the chipper. The owner climbed down, discovered that the brush chipper had shut off, and that only the victim’s hand was visible in the feed chute. The owner immediately contacted the homeowner; 911 was called and emergency medical services arrived within minutes. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, employers should: � Ensure that workers fully understand and strictly follow the safe <b>operating,</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting, and machine maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturers when operating brush chippers; � Train workers in safe and proper feeding technique to avoid the hazard of being pulled into an operating brush chipper; � Ensure that the safety instructions and training are provided in a language that workers are able to comprehend; � Designate another employee as a safety watch to assist the brush chipper operator and; � Ensure that the area in front of the infeed hopper is free of tripping hazards. Additionally: � Brush chipper manufacturers should install additional safety features including emergency shut-off devices on brush chippers...|$|E

50|$|The {{railroad}} {{began as}} the Tyrone and Lock Haven Railroad, incorporated on February 21, 1857 {{to construct a}} line {{the full length of}} the Bald Eagle Valley, from Tyrone to Lock Haven. A supplement to the charter on May 4, 1857 authorized further extensions, from Tyrone to Hollidaysburg to reach the Allegheny Portage Railroad, and from Lock Haven to Williamsport to reach the Sunbury and Erie Railroad. Shortly thereafter, contracts were placed for the Eastern Division of the line and for a branch from Milesburg to Bellefonte. However, the railroad was short of capital, and an attempt to defraud its contractors was exposed in 1859. It did complete a small portion of line that year, the Bellefonte Branch from Bellefonte to Milesburg and the part of the main line from Milesburg to Wingate (then known as Snow-Shoe Intersection). There it connected with the Bellefonte and Snowshoe Railroad, which would <b>operate</b> the <b>troubled</b> T&LH for the next few years.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three {{papers on}} the economic study of domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorism is the most prevalent form of terrorism, yet, when compared to transnational terrorism, is understudied in the literature. This thesis makes two game theoretic and one econometric contribution to this literature. Chapter 3 presents a model of how a revolutionary terrorist interacts with both governments and members of society. This model shows that societies adverse to violence can incentivise reductions in terrorism but can also induce escalations of violence and lax government responses. Chapter 4 contributes to the signalling literature, by painting a revolutionary terrorist that has both political and militant wings. The leadership of this organisation favours one wing over the other and attempts to signal this preference to its rivals. This model shows that terrorist organisations {{are more likely to}} signal their true type to adversaries who have access to similar levels of resources. Finally, Chapter 5 uses duration modelling to test the interaction of rival terrorist organisations <b>operating</b> during The <b>Troubles</b> in Northern Ireland in the late- 20 th century, showing that both the main Republican and Loyalist players deviated from their local and temporal strategies to interact with each other...|$|R

5000|$|In 1963, the Ba’th Arab Socialist Party {{became the}} ruling party of Syria. The Ba’th’s own {{constitution}} aims for social and political reform, one of these reforms being an equality between women and men. Once the government made the reform program national in 1970, Islamic law and the secular views of the party began working hand in hand. Because of this, Syrian women’s rights {{were placed on the}} forefront. Syria is fairly ahead of other Arab countries with equal rights for women. As a result, The GUSW was formed to keep the issue of equality for women a priority. The GUSW was a newer formation of the Women's Union that had been formed before the Ba'th party gained control. To sum this up, in 1968, the Women's Union was included in the Ba'ath party structure as the GUSW.

40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 42 Severely damaged rotors {{often can}} be rebuilt even when damage has {{occurred}} to the shaft/rotor forging. Such shop repair returns {{what would have}} been a scrapped or degraded rotor to original equipment standards. The repair procedure is to: ? Remove damaged areas of the rotor by machining. ? Build up metal with metallurgically compatible weld wire and fluxes, using submerged arc welding in sequences as dictated by repair design. ? Thoroughly inspect the welded/machined area by magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and dye check procedures after each sequence. ? Stress relieve the welded area after each sequence, using computer controlled heating of the desired area so as to control hardness in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and assure adequate metallurgical properties in the weld metal. ? Repeat these sequences until the repaired area conforms to the design required by welding engineering, mechanical engineering, insurance specialists, and/or consulting metallurgical laboratories. These procedures can often provide metallurgical properties superior to those of the original material, move the heat affected zone (HAZ) out of the steam path, strengthen the repaired area, compensate for anticipated problems, and/or improve the original design of the rotor. Such repairs involve use of special jigs, equipment, techniques, and procedures. A detailed description of the turbine rim weld repair is given, including use of supplementary pictures, drawings and techniques. Cracks were discovered in the body of a nominal 22 in diameter, first stage Curtis wheel of a forged turbine rotor. Laboratory analysis indicated the cracks were due to stress corrosion, believed to have been caused by caustic introduced accidentally with inlet steam. The damaged portion of the wheel was removed by machining at a point well into the unaffected portion of the wheel. The remaining rim was welded to build up, heat treated, finish machined to accept blades, and rebladed. The finished rotor was dynamically balanced at operating speed, installed in its casing, and returned to service. The reinstalled rotor has <b>operated</b> without <b>trouble</b> at up to design conditions for a number of months. These welding procedures were evolved and improved through experience gained over the past eight years in the repair of about 80 damaged turbine rims. Similar repairs have also been performed on centrifugal compressor rotor wheels and shafting. Monitoring and periodic shop inspection of these welded rotors has shown no degradation in the repaired areas. Repair costs have been well below those that would have been incurred by replacement with original vendor equipment and, most often, in significantly less time than it would have taken if a new rotor was provided from the original equipment manufacturer...|$|R
