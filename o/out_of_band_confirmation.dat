50|$|Oversampling is {{typically}} used in audio frequency ADCs where the required sampling rate (typically 44.1 or 48 kHz) {{is very low}} compared to the clock speed of typical transistor circuits (>1 MHz). In this case, by using the extra bandwidth to distribute quantization error onto <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> frequencies, {{the accuracy of the}} ADC can be greatly increased at no cost. Furthermore, as any aliased signals are also typically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band,</b> aliasing can often be completely eliminated using very low cost filters.|$|R

40|$|Despite of many {{advantages}} of OFDM, {{it has two}} main drawbacks which are high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and synchronization problem. High PAPR causes saturation in power amplifiers, leading to intermodulation products among the sub carriers and disturbing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> energy. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the PAPR by means of PAPR reduction schemes. However, it caused the degradation of BER and enhanced the growth <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> radiation {{which has led to}} the degradation of OFDM overall performance In this paper, OFDM system with an enhanced clipping technique has been proposed, the effects of clipping have been analyzed and the system is evaluated by integrating with its significant features including convolutional forward error control coding, oversampled inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) and digital filtering technique in order to minimize the effects of clipping. It is shown that the bit error rate (BER) of the clipped OFDM signal is improved, the PAPR is further reduced and the effect <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> radiation is minimized. Besides, other effects of filtering technique are also analyzed in order to optimize the overall performance of our proposed system...|$|R

50|$|Where Q is {{the number}} of {{quantization}} bits. For example, a 16-bit ADC has a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 6.02 × 16 = 96.3 dB, and therefore the quantization error is 96.3 dB below the maximum level. Quantization error is distributed from DC to the Nyquist frequency, consequently if part of the ADC's bandwidth is not used (as in oversampling), some of the quantization error will fall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band,</b> effectively improving the SQNR. In an oversampled system, noise shaping can be used to further increase SQNR by forcing more quantization error <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>band.</b>|$|R
