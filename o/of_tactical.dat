5|$|As {{an expert}} in the use of air units to aid {{artillery}} and infantry, Gordon P. Saville held to the concept <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> air power through his time as ACTS instructor from 1934 to 1936. Later, Saville successfully implemented his ideas in the Mediterranean Theater.|$|E

5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Philip Saville (September 14, 1902 – January 31, 1984) was a United States Air Force {{major general}} {{who was the}} top {{authority}} on US air defense from 1940 to 1951. Blunt and direct in manner, Saville had been an outspoken proponent <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> aviation in the 1930s against a brotherhood of airmen who promoted strategic bombing.|$|E
5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British {{should have known better}} than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage.

5|$|Simple one-move or two-move {{tactical}} actions – threats, {{exchanges of}} material, and double attacks– {{can be combined}} into more complicated combinations, sequences <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> maneuvers that are often forced {{from the point of}} view of one or both players. Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.|$|E

Seventeen of the team's 26 players went on to play provincially in New Zealand, and two, Thomas Ellison and David Gage, subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team.|$|E
5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> first-person {{shooters}} in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around counter-terrorism, requiring missions to be planned before execution and in it, a single hit was sometimes enough to kill a character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person shooters set during World War II.|$|E

Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> battles taking place on grid-based maps, but with added elements such as a fatigue system where characters lose energy with each performed action.|$|E

5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises and the development <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> operations.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|Genealogy of the Holy War {{takes place}} on the {{continent}} of Jugdral, split between eight different countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers who ended {{the rule of the}} ancient dragon Loptyr with divine aid. In the present, a cult working to revive Loptyr stir up war among the countries. The story is told over two generations — the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> battles taking place on grid-based maps, while adding the Weapons Triangle and Support systems, which directly impacted both gameplay and story.|$|E

5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E
5|$|Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion. Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated invasion fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try to confuse German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended to confuse the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} <b>of</b> <b>tactical</b> {{flexibility}} meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel {{with a much}} smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
