A test scenario was designed for comparing basic polygonal 3 D modelling with these two user interfaces. Preliminary results of the user test are presented. Results indicate that the test scenario is viable and point out the need for further development...|$|R

We shall argue that the magic circle, instead of separating fiction and reality, would work as a cognitive mediation structure with graded “boundaries”, which existence occurs in diverse forms, depending on variables like player immersion and attention. Thus, these boundaries get defined and “solid ” as the <b>immersive</b> <b>process</b> is developed and one reality seems to change into another: as the player “gets into the looking glass”...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{programming}} centered at the site, {{the museum}} is actively engaged in the surrounding community {{in a variety of}} capacities. Connections, a comprehensive outreach program, aims to create sustainable relationships between the Museum and the diverse communities of the Bay Area. The Museum invites preschools to visit five times annually to experience child-directed play in <b>our</b> <b>immersive</b> exhibits. Additionally, Museum educators provide hands-on programming that deepens children's relationship to the natural world. Through exploration, collaboration and guidance from adults, big discoveries happen. Staff members visit the partnering preschools to broaden the scope of the program. Ongoing support throughout the school year helps teachers connect the Museum experience into their classroom curriculum.|$|R

However they often {{spend a lot of time}} editing a program and correcting typos and misspellings, according to our observation, when a text programming language is used because many novic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an intuitive and e#cient way to design not only 3 -D shapes {{but also their}} geometric constraints within an immersive modeler. The fundamental concept of the proposed method is based on <b>our</b> <b>immersive</b> modeler VLEGO II, which allows multiple users to create 3 -D virtual objects only by assembling simple 3 -D geometric shapes (shape primitives) like with real toy blocks. In our system, geometric constraints are presented as primitives (constraining primitives) like normal shape primitives, and the geometric constraints are imposed on virtual objects simply by assembling shape and constraining primitives. The system also provides flexible two-handed interaction to support intuitive and e#cient manipulations...|$|R

Our 3 -D representations are designed {{from the perspective of}} monitoring traffic at an administrative boundary between the Internet and an internal network. In our virtual environment, a physical boundary and defended territory serve as a familiar visual metaphor for users. The user is provided with multiple ways of exploring the environment and interrogating visual objects for additional information and synchronizing the environment with external analysis tools. We have used this system on complete data from multiple sites for purposes of situational awareness and detecting and analyzing traffic patterns for anomalous behavior. I...|$|R

In fact, <b>our</b> <b>immersive</b> guide communicates toward heterogeneous wireless networks and collects information on the user position both indoor and outdoor through properly setup communication technologies, furnishes location infor- mation through robust algorithms, and enables access to context aware services through a graphical service-browser which interacts, following a client-server protocol, in a multi- user environments...|$|R
