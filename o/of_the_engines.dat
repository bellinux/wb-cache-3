5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|The M-240 Storm MultiMission Vehicle is {{the first}} of three Storm generations. A variant of the 1991 Jeep Wrangler YJ and the older CJ-6/CJ-8 wheelbase, it is entirely {{produced}} in Israel by Automotive Industries Ltd. with the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> as their manufacture is not economically viable on the Storm's market scale.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E

40|$|This project {{developed}} an inservice life-monitoring system capable <b>of</b> predicting <b>the</b> remaining component and system life <b>of</b> aircraft <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> embedded system provides real-time, inflight monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> thrust, exhaust gas temperature, efficiency, {{and the speed}} and time of operation. Based upon this data, the life-estimation algorithm calculates <b>the</b> remaining life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> components and uses this data to predict <b>the</b> remaining life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> calculations {{are based on the}} statistical life distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> components and their relationship to load, speed, temperature, and time...|$|R

For <b>the</b> road-version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> restrictors were not needed so <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was developed without them.|$|R
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only {{to be replaced by a}} very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kane {{then took}} his ship to Sydney, where they {{received}} a hero's welcome. The narrowness of Calliopes escape; the excellence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> and {{the dedication of the}} crew, who kept the power plant in operation for many hours during the ordeal; the seamanship of Captain Kane and officers; their bravery in letting go of their anchor and facing the storm, trusting only in their ship and themselves; and the respect and encouragement given to them by the crew of Trenton; made Calliope famous.|$|E
50|$|When {{referring}} to cars, <b>the</b> left-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car is {{the side that}} corresponds with the driver's left, {{as seen from the}} driver's seat. It can also be thought <b>of</b> as <b>the</b> side that would be on the left if one was standing directly behind the car looking at it.When {{referring to}} <b>engines,</b> <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is <b>the</b> part where the pulleys for the accessories (such as the alternator and water pump) are, and <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is where <b>the</b> flywheel is, through which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> connects to <b>the</b> transmission. <b>The</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> may point towards the front, side or rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. In most rear-wheel drive cars, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is longitudinally mounted and <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> also points to <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. In front-wheel drive cars with a transverse <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> usually points towards <b>the</b> right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. One notable exception is Honda, where many models have <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at <b>the</b> left-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|R
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> rather than using a separate system of gears driven from <b>the</b> back end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crankshaft; this allowed <b>the</b> overall length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> which required a long shaft to run to its location at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The YF120's {{variable}} cycle {{system worked}} by varying <b>the</b> bypass ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for different flight regimes, allowing <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{to act like}} either a low bypass turbofan or nearly a turbojet. As a low bypass turbofan (like competitor F119), <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> performed similarly to comparable engines. When needed, however, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could direct more airflow through <b>the</b> hot core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> (like a turbojet), increasing <b>the</b> specific thrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This made <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> more efficient at high altitude, high thrust levels than a traditional low bypass turbofan.|$|R
5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} August 2005, with work on both {{platforms}} and the intermediate tower occurring {{through the summer}} of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006. Installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> and other equipment occurred during the {{spring and early summer}} of 2006, which was followed by installation of the cables during the late summer and early fall.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1990: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and sidecar. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 350cc class existed from 1949 until 1982. The 350cc referred to the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> of the motorcycles that participated in the class. The engines had four cylinders, similar to the types of engines used in MotoGP today.|$|E

50|$|In {{earliest}} steam <b>engines</b> <b>the</b> boiler {{was considered}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Today {{they are considered}} separate, so {{it is necessary to}} know whether stated efficiency is overall, which includes the boiler, or just <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> rotary version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had <b>the</b> fuel {{injection}} pump mounted on <b>the</b> rotating portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> along with <b>the</b> cylinders. Fuel, lubricating oil and cooling water were supplied through rotating couplings.|$|R
5|$|In March 2012 a team {{of specialists}} financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that {{launched}} Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface {{through the use of}} advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.|$|E
5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> in use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5000|$|A house-built {{engine is}} a {{stationary}} steam engine that {{is built into}} an engine house, such that it uses <b>the</b> masonry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> house {{as an integral part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The JV6 engines {{used in the}} Jaguar racing {{cars were}} {{produced}} by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger, but delivering the number of engines required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity. TWR formed a division, TWR Road Engines, to manage the design, development, construction and testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> for the production cars. The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with the engines Heidegger built {{for use in the}} XJR racing cars, being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular, the European emissions requirements, which the race engines didn't have to meet.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
50|$|While {{development}} of a sea-level version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was completed and fully qualified by early 2015, Blue said then that they intend to develop a vacuum version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to operate in space.|$|R
50|$|The 003 was {{intended}} for export to Japan, but working examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> were never supplied. Instead, Japanese engineers used drawings and photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to design an indigenous turbojet, the Ishikawajima Ne-20.|$|R

5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were {{able to get out of}} the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel {{differential}} pressurization {{pulse jet}} engine is suggested in this paper.
