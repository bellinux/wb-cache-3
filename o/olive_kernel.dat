40|$|The {{effect of}} type of frying oil and {{temperature}} on the oxidative stability {{of potato chips}} during storage was studied. Cottonseed oil, soybean oil, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> oil and palmolein were used as frying media. The chips were packaged in metallized cellophane bags and incubated at 63 degrees C. At definite time intervals the absorbed oil was extracted and analyzed for peroxide value, Totox number and conjugated diene content. <b>Olive</b> <b>kernel</b> oil and palmolein absorbed into the chips showed better stability, whereas soybean oil presented the higher oxidation rate. Frying temperature (170, 180 or 190 degrees C) {{did not affect the}} oxidation rate during storage, with the exception of conjugated diene formation which was greater for chips fried at 190 degrees C. Ground oregano or oregano extract, obtained by petroleum ether extraction, were added to the chips as antioxidants. Both retarded significantly the oxidation rate of the oil absorbed into the chips, with results comparable to tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) during storage at 63 degrees C for 7 days; however TBHQ proved significantly more effective after that time.

Within this study raw <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> samples (OK 1, OK 2) and a pre-treated one by water leaching (LOK 2) were examined {{with regard to their}} ash fouling propensity and tar concentration in the gaseous phase. Two temperatures (T = 850 and 950 degrees C) and a constant steam to biomass ratio (S/B = 1. 28) were chosen in order to perform the steam gasification experiments.

However, the impacts of co-firing on other aspects of performance (e. g. particle burnout) are not well understood. This study characterizes different coal-biomass blends by thermogravimetric anal.

Carbonisation of blends of <b>olive</b> <b>kernels</b> in Ptolemais lignite (0 - 100 dry-wt%), were performed in a Setaram TG- 92 TGA (N 2, 5 K min- 1, 398 to 1200 K), fuels selected as being readily available in Europe. When compared with a rule-of-mixts. type model, the wt. -loss (TG) profiles revealed linear correlations between biomass content and wt. -loss (RMS error < 1. 03 wt%). Wt. -loss rate (-dTG) data of the blends were deconvolved using five Lorentzian peaks.

40|$|Highlights • The {{pyrolysis}} of pine, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> thistle and corncob is studied using DAEM. • The {{uncertainties of}} activation energy Ea and pre-exponential factor k 0 are evaluated. • A {{higher number of}} TGA curves reduces {{the uncertainty of the}} kinetic data (Ea, k 0). • Considering uncertainties of input data improves accuracy of the kinetic data (Ea, k 0). • The effect of the precision of the TGA analyser on the kinetic data is studied. The Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) is widely used for determination of characteristic parameters of pyrolysis kinetics from a certain number of experimental thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves obtained at different heating rates. The number of heating rates employed to obtain different TGA curves varies between different authors, being typically between 3 and 5. The validity of DAEM has been discussed by several authors based on its capability of describing the devolatilization kinetics of the samples. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no studies available in the literature evaluating the uncertainties associated to the simplified DAEM method or quantifying the effect of considering different numbers of TGA curves in the analysis. Therefore, we studied the effect of the number of TGA curves considered in this work, as well as the effect of considering or neglecting the uncertainties of different measurement parameters employed in the calculation. The characterization was carried out using four types of biomass (pine wood, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> thistle flower and corncob) employing up to 9 different heating rates between 10 and 40 K/min during the TGA tests. Activation energies and pre-exponential factors were given and their uncertainties were reduced by increasing the number of TGA curves obtained at different heating rates. Nonetheless, considering measurement uncertainties during the calculations reduces significantly the final uncertainties of the pyrolysis parameters, permitting the reduction of the number of TGA curves used in the analysis...|$|E

The mixture of crude glycerol and swine manure improved the quality of bio-oil and its distillated fractions compared with the pyrolysis of swine manure alone (Cheng et al. 2014 a). The addition of glycerol has been found as a factor to improve hydrogen (H 2) concentration in the Syngas. The addition of 20  % of glycerol to lignite generated H 2 sixfold higher than lignite pyrolysis (Manara and Zabaniotou 2013). Similar to lignite, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> pyrolysis exhibited an increment of 11.6  % in the concentration of H 2 when 25  % of the crude glycerol was added (Skoulou et al. 2012). Besides the increment in H 2 concentration, glycerol also increased the concentration of light hydrocarbons in Syngas.

In-situ catalytic upgrading of biomass fast pyrolysis vapours was performed in a fixed bed bench-scale reactor at 500 °C, for catalyst screening purposes. A maximum bio-oil yield of 47. 35 wt. % (on dry biomass) was obtained from non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at a reaction temperature of 450 °C, while the bio-oil yield was decreased at 37. 14 wt. % when the temperature was increased to 500 °C.

40|$|The use of thermogravimetric {{analysis}} to describe biomass kinetics often uses bench top thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) analysers which are only capable of low heating rates. The {{aim of this}} research was to compare experimental fast pyrolysis of <b>Olive</b> <b>kernels</b> in a bespoke laboratory thermogravimetric fluidised bed reactor (TGFBR) characterised by rapid heating rates at high flow rates, compared to a smaller bench scale fixed bed TGA system. The pyrolysis in the TGFBR was analysed by using the isothermal kinetic approach and it was theorised that the pyrolysis decomposition reactions occurred by two mechanisms depending on the temperature, resulting in an activation energy of 67. 4 kJ/mol at temperatures below 500 °C. For comparison, a bench scale TGA was used to look at the thermal behaviour in different fixed bed thermal conditions giving a higher activation energy of 74. 4 kJ/mol due to the effect of external particle gas diffusion. The effect of biomass particle size (0. 3 – 4. 0 mm) on the conversion of biomass at different temperatures, was investigated between 300 and 660 °C in the TGFBR. The results suggested inhibition of internal gas diffusion was more important at lower temperatures, but in comparison had no significant effect when measured in the fixed bed TGA at lower heating rates. Bench top TGA analysis of pyrolysis is a rapid and valuable method, but is limited by smaller sample sizes and lower heating rates.

In this work, the pyrolysis and combustion behavior of 10 biomass and waste materials was investigated in a nonisothermal thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Q 600) at ambient pressure and 150 - 250 -μm particle size. The effect of the heating rate (5, 20, 50, and 100 °C/min) was also considered. The independent parallel first-order reaction model was elaborated for the kinetic analysis of the pyrolysis results. The thermal degradation of the biomass/ waste samples was modeled assuming three or four parallel reactions. At increased heating rates, enhanced pyrolysis rates were achieved. As a result, a slight decrease in total weight loss was observed, accompanied by a systematic increase in pyrolysis starting temperature and an almost linear increase in maximum pyrolysis rate from 5 % to 90 %/min. Increased combustion reactivity was found for <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> and willow, followed by forest residue.

40|$|The design, {{modelling}} and optimisation of biofuel {{thermochemical processes}} are mainly {{based on the}} knowledge of reliable chemical kinetics. The determination of reaction kinetics of biomass at high heating rate still highly depends on the extrapolation of results from kinetic data determined at a comparatively low heating rate. To provide more comprehensive kinetic data for gas-solid reactions under isothermal conditions, a thermogravimetric fluidized bed reactor (TGFBR) was designed. Using this novel fluidised bed, gravimetric measurements and high heating rate, the thermal conversion of biomass was investigated. Using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) as a fixed bed and the TGFBR as a fluidized bed, the pyrolysis kinetics of <b>olive</b> <b>kernels</b> was studied. The pyrolysis in the TGFBR was analysed using the isothermal kinetic approach and it was theorised that the pyrolysis decomposition reaction occurred by two mechansims. Dependent on the temperature, the resultant activation energy was 67. 4 kJ/mole at 500 °C. For comparsion, the TGA gave a higher activation energy of 74. 4 kJ/mole due to external particle diffusion. To study the impact of torrefaction on gasification performance, gasification experiments were performed on “as received olive kernels” (AROK) and “as received torrefied olive kernels” (ARTOK) in the TGFBR. The effect of equivalence ratio (ER) (0. 15 - 0. 35) and bed temperature (550 - 750 °C) on gasification performance was investigated. Based on thermogravimetric measurements using a mass balance model, the activation energy of AROK {{was found to be}} 84 kJ/mole, whereas ARTOK was found to be 106 kJ/mole. The results suggest that diffusion controls the reaction of AROK, while oxidation controls the reaction of torrefied biomass. The pyrolysis of date palm stones was also studied in the TGFBR, and the kinetic expression was determined using a model fitting method. The most probable reaction mechanism for the thermal decomposition of palm stones was three-dimensional diffusion. The activation energy for experiments between 350 °C and 600 °C for date palm stones was 27. 67 kJ/mole. Furthermore, the gasification of date palm stones was investigated at ER (0. 15 - 0. 35) and a temperature range of 600 - 750 °C in 50 °C increments. Based on the energy yield (7 MJ/kg), the results suggest that the optimum conditions were at T= 750 °C and ER= 0. 2. Overall, the result reveals that the TGFBR, in comparison with TGA, would be a viable reactor that enables kinetic analysis of gas-solid reactions under isothermal conditions, benefiting from its features. The parameters obtained from the kinetic study of TGFBR are essential in the scale-up design of useful conversion technologies such as gasification. Also, the pre-treatment of biomass via torrefaction is a promising route to improve gas production in a bubbling fluidised bed gasifier...|$|R

The paper {{presents the results}} of kinetic parameters and main devolatilisation characteristics of three biomass materials, when these are used either alone or in conjunction with Greek lignite. Namely, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> forest and cotton residues were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser, under dynamic conditions. The effect of material particle size and heating rate was investigated both on the pyrolysis behavior and reaction kinetics, over the temperature range of 25 - 850 degreesC. Furthermore, experiments with blends of lignite and biomass were conducted under the same conditions at the lower heating rate. The biomass materials presented higher thermochemical reactivity than lignite. Their decomposition was successfully modeled by three first-order independent parallel reactions, describing the degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. No significant influence of the particle size was detected, both on the devolatilisation characteristics and kinetics. The effect of the heating rate on the pyrolysis behavior was more pronounced for biomass materials rather than lignite. A comparison between slow and fast heating rate tests reveals a small displacement of the DTG profiles to higher temperatures. It was concluded that such 'solid biofuels' could support the combustion of poor coals, because of the faster and in much higher quantity release of volatile compounds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The organosolv process included lignocellulosic biomass treatment with formic acid/acetic acid/water (30 / 50 / 20, v/v%), for 3 h at 107 °C, while the physicochemical method was conducted by immersing the biomass in a water/ethanol (8 / 92, v/v%), H 2 SO 4 0. 32 M, solvent and further exposing the slurry to microwave irradiation (maximum 250 W) for 1 / 2 h at 150 °C.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{deals with}} the theoretical, {{experimental}} and modeling work which was performed to study deposition during biomass and waste co-combustion in pulverised coal facilities. Fossil fuels dominate the current energy scenario. Increasing concerns about fossil fuels availability and {{about the impact of}} their extensive use on the environment, had led public and governments to focus their attention on the utilisation of sustainable forms of energy. Reducing CO 2 emissions, increasing the shares of renewable energy consumption and improving energy efficiency have become world wide targets. In this context biomass and waste fuels are being increasingly used. An economical option to introduce biomass fuels is to co-fire them together with coal in existing pulverised coal facilities. But formation of ash deposits from solid fuels combustion influences operation of utility boilers. Many studies have been done to characterise deposition trends of coal fuels. The behaviour of biomass and waste fuels differs considerably from that of coals given the distinct composition and association of their organic matter. A better knowledge of the behaviour of biomass and waste fuels is required to predict deposits formation. Different and complementary approaches are explored in this PhD work in order to contribute to the current knowledge on deposition of ashes from co-firing biomass and waste fuels with coal. A set of fuels fired in full scale facilities were available for this research including two different coals, pine chips, B-wood, corn and rape straw, plastic and green house residue, biomass mix, palm <b>kernels,</b> <b>olive</b> residue, pepper plant, chicken litter and meat and bone meal. In the experimental part of this work, a wide range of biomass and waste fuels has been analysed by standard methods and their ashes have been obtained at laboratory. A leaching procedure for the ashes has been developed based on chemical fractionation techniques widely used for biomass fuels. Thermo Mechanical Analysis (TMA) has been applied to the ashes and their leached solid residues to investigate their fusion characteristics. The TMA traces of the ashes and their successively leached solid residues are a fuel ‘foot print’ and depend strongly on the chemical composition of the samples. The difference between the TMA traces of biomass ashes before and after leaching them, clearly relates with the reactivity of the inorganic compounds and can be used to rank the fuels depending on the reactivity of their inorganic compounds during combustion and their tendency to form deposits. In parallel to this work on the leached solid residues, chemical analysis of the liquid leachates has been done and the results used to classify the fuels as having more or less reactive inorganics. Both approaches convey to the same conclusion about the fuel reactivity ranking. Chicken litter, MBM, olive residue and plastic and green house residue are predicted to be more prone to deposition, while pine chips and biomass mix appear to have the smaller presence of ‘problematic’ inorganic species and therefore will give less deposition. Experimental work has also been conducted to investigate the effects of deposits build up on heat transfer surfaces, as {{this is one of the}} biggest impacts associated to deposits in plant operation. This effect can be monitored on line using appropriate probes and thermocouples to evaluate the heat transferred to the cooling medium. Two different air cooled metal probes have been developed and tested. Deposition experiments have been done at a 50 kWel pulverized fuel flow combustion reactor (CR) designed, commissioned and started up during this research work. At the CR different deposition probes have been tested and different fuels and fuel blends have been co-fired with coal, such as MBM, chicken litter, olive residue, B-Wood or palm kernels. The decay in thermal flow from the hot flue gases to the cold probe cooling air has been measured but characterisation of the different behaviour of fuels and fuels blends based only on heat transfer measurements was not possible. Samples of deposits were collected from the cooled metal probes and from the specially designed ceramic probes. Some fuels are found to produce more sintered deposits –chicken litter, palm <b>kernels,</b> <b>olive</b> residue- while the others appear less sintered. The results of these observations compare well with the results from TMA. Samples of the deposits collected in the probes are analysed to obtain their chemical composition. In the modeling part of this work chemical equilibrium models are used to investigate the occurrence of ash deposits due to co-firing of biomass and coal. Traditional chemical equilibrium calculations combined with an existing combustion model are used to model the deposition experiments done in the CR facility. The enrichment of some elements found in the deposits and the amount of melt phase obtained by modeling compare well with the experimental values. All combustion experiments performed at 1300 °C give a percentage of melt above the 15 %, meaning that sintered deposits form. The model takes into account data about reactivity of the inorganic species in each fuel as obtained by ash leaching analysis and the availability of some inorganics existing in the outer layers of the fuel particle. It has been observed that the results of ash melting by equilibrium calculations strongly depend on the fraction of inorganic components of the fuel that are accounted for as reactive/non reactive. The model has been applied to predict the formation of condensed fases for the fuels studied.

40|$|A {{modification}} of the simplified Distributed Activation Energy Model is proposed to simulate the pyrolysis of biomass under parabolic and exponential temperature increases. The pyrolysis of pine wood, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> thistle flower and corncob was experimentally studied in a TGA Q 500 thermogravimetric analyzer. The results of the measurements of nine different parabolic and exponential temperature increases for each sample were employed to validate the models proposed. The deviation between the experimental TGA measurements and the estimation of the reacted fraction during the pyrolysis of the four samples under parabolic and exponential temperature increases was lower than 5 °C for all the cases studied. The models derived in this work to describe the pyrolysis of biomass with parabolic and exponential temperature increases {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the experiments conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{experimental study}} is conducted {{to evaluate and}} compare the use of various Diesel fuel supplements at blend ratios of 10 / 90 and 20 / 80, in a standard, fully instrumented, four stroke, direct injection (DI), Ricardo/Cussons 'Hydra' Diesel engine located at the authors' laboratory. More specifically, a high variety of vegetable oils or bio-diesels of various origins are tested as supplements, i. e. cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and their corresponding methyl esters, as well as rapeseed oil methyl ester, palm oil methyl ester, corn oil and <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> oil. The series of tests are conducted using each of the above fuel blends, with the engine working at a speed of 2000 rpm and at a medium and high load. In each test, volumetric fuel consumption, exhaust smokiness and exhaust regulated gas emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO) and total unburned hydrocarbons (HQ are measured. From the first measurement, specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency are computed. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters from the baseline operation of the engine, i. e. when working with neat Diesel fuel, are determined and compared. This comparison is extended {{between the use of}} the vegetable oil blends and the bio-diesel blends. Theoretical aspects of Diesel engine combustion, combined with the widely differing physical and chemical properties of these Diesel fuel supplements against the normal Diesel fuel, are used to aid the correct interpretation of the observed engine behavior.

40|$|AbstractBiomass {{gasification}} {{is one of}} {{the several}} technologies with a very high potential for rural power generation applications. The proposed system is greenhouse gas neutral because the CO 2 emissions from biomass are considered “carbon neutral”. In this paper a prototype gasification system (70 kWe- 245 kWth) combined with a gas engine is presented while its performance is tested using olive industry wastes (<b>olive</b> <b>kernel)</b> as fuel. The above CHP system represents a decentralized conversion system that functions economically even for small scale, fulfilling the operation conditions for an olive oil cooperative. The open top, downdraft gasifier consists of reactor, cooling and cleaning system. The producer gas exits the reactor at about 500 °C, and includes contaminants in form of particulate matter and tar. The hot gas is further purified in the gas cooling and cleaning system in order to reach a state that is acceptable for engine operations. Initial tests in the prototype are carried out in order to achieve a profitable exploitation. Critical parameters such as producer gas composition and pressure drop of gasifier, are examined and assessed in order to enable the complete adaptation of the system to the operational specifications of an olive cooperative. The main objective is the optimization of the system in terms of gasification efficiency, gas composition, gas quality and electrical efficiency. The presented results are repeatable and give information about the steady state of gasifier when working at full load, producing a good quality gas with an electric efficiency of 16. 1 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} study of the kinetics of gasification of <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> by using a thermogravimetric fluidized bed reactor technique. Gasification of ‘as received’ and torrefied olive kernels were investigated in a lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, operating at up to 3. 2 kg/hr. The effect of bed temperature between 550 °C and 750 °C in 50 °C increments on the gasification product gas at mass-based equivalence ratios of 0. 15 and 0. 2 was studied. To explore the potential of torrefied biomass, the gasification results were {{compared to that of}} the ‘as received’ biomass. The product gas from torrefied biomass produced higher H 2, CO and CH 4 concentrations at identical oxidant flow rates in addition to higher cold gas efficiency and higher product gas heating value. The influence of equivalence ratio in gasification was also investigated at reactor temperatures of 750 °C and five equivalence ratios (0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 25, 0. 3, and 0. 35). The results revealed that the torrefied biomass has the highest HHV at an equivalence ratio of 0. 2 with a value of 6. 09 MJ/Nm 3, while ‘as received’ biomass 4. 72 MJ/Nm 3. Kinetic experiments under isothermal conditions were performed for the gasification of the materials in continuous mode. A mass balance model was successfully used to provide the capability of separately determining the rate constant of the reactions taking place. The kinetic parameters were calculated by a first order reaction model giving activation energies for ‘as received’ olive kernels of 84 kJ/mole and for torrefied olive kernels of 106 kJ/mole...|$|E
40|$|There is renewed {{interest}} worldwide {{in the production}} of sustainable energy from renewable sources, such as biomass, aimed mainly at the decrease of fossil fuels use. Except for its potential to be CO 2 ""neutral"" during combustion, biomass has a low sulfur content and a high volatile concentration: these characteristics favor clean combustion conditions. The knowledge of the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis and combustion is important for the control of such thermochemical processes. The main objective of this work was to determine the kinetic parameters of thermal decomposition of two biomass materials, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> and straw, and of their mixtures with a high- and a low-rank coal. The study was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in nitrogen atmosphere, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. A kinetic model, involving first-order independent parallel reactions, was used. Activation energies and frequency factors were determined for two different particle sizes. The analysis indicated that the pyrolysis of the coals and the biomass samples could be modeled successfully via the independent reactions models, the pyrolysis of biomass being described by reactions corresponding to hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin decomposition. The results showed that the chemical composition of each biomass type plays a fundamental role in the kinetics determination. Smaller conversion times and increased devolatilization rates were obtained, when biomass was added in the fuel blend with coal. The additive properties of coal and biomass, pyrolyzed in blends, were examined. It was proven that the mass loss vs time during thermal conversion of coal/biomass blends is well-described by the sum of each individual coal and biomass decomposition...|$|E
30|$|Crude {{glycerol}} gasification used traditional processes; however, microwave plasma gasification and Supercritical Water Gasification {{have also}} been employed to gasify crude glycerol. Traditional crude glycerol gasification is performed in a co-gasification process. Crude glycerol has been gasified along with <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> hardwood chips, physic nut waste, and palm shell waste (Sricharoenchaikul and Atong 2012; Wei et al. 2011; Rattanapan et al. 2011; Skoulou and Zabaniotou 2013). The co-gasification of crude glycerol and biomass incremented Syngas yield, heating value, and H 2 concentration (Sricharoenchaikul and Atong 2012; Wei et al. 2011; Rattanapan et al. 2011; Skoulou and Zabaniotou 2013). The Syngas produced from the crude glycerol co-gasification can be further employed to generate electricity or to produce chemicals or biofuels (Skoulou and Zabaniotou 2013). On the other hand, microwave plasma gasification is a technology that utilizes plasma flames produced by external electrical sources to gasify substrates. Crude glycerol microwave plasma gasification demonstrated an increment in gasification efficiency and Syngas heating value (Yoon et al. 2013). Another type of gasification is supercritical water gasification. This technology utilizes supercritical water to improve the gasification efficiency. Supercritical water {{has the ability to}} act as an acid/base catalyst, dissolve non-polar organic compounds, and react with other compounds (Tapah et al. 2014). The application of supercritical water gasification in crude glycerol has been evaluated in the presence of KOH and Fe 2 O 3 –Cr 2 O 3 as catalysts (Yang et al. 2013; Tapah et al. 2014). Catalytic supercritical water gasification improved the Syngas quality by reducing biochar impurities and increasing the amount of combustible gases, especially H 2. However, KOH did not act as a catalyst; in fact, KOH acted as a reactant in the process and generated K 2 CO 3 as the product (Yang et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present doctoral thesis is {{the investigation of the}} energetic utilisation of biomass in fluidised bed gasification installations, by applying an integrated methodology for the evaluation, forecast and study of the behaviour of novel biomass fuels. Biomass is a renewable energy source (RES) with a potential capable of constituting a considerable energy alternative for the European Union, thus contributing to the achievement of the {{objective of}} reducing fossil fuel import, as well as the objective of greenhouse gas emission reduction. The fluidised bed reactor technology has been proven as an expedient choice for biomass utilisation, concerning gasification as well as combustion, as it has the possibility of using fuels with a large variety of physical characteristics, such as moisture and ash. The fluidised bed combustion technology of biomass is more advanced compared to gasification, having been applied already in industrial scale. Gasification of biomass can be integrated in systems with large energy outputs and efficiencies, although this technology is still confronted with technical problems such as the gas cleaning from heavy hydrocarbons (tars) that limit its application in the large scale. The thesis consists of seven Chapters (1 - 7). Chapter 1 is an introduction to the necessity of biomass exploitation as an alternative fuel in the European Union. Chapter 2 presents an extensive literature review on the physical and chemical characteristics of biomass, the basic principles of gasification and the bed agglomeration mechanisms due to ash sintering in fluidised bed reactors that can lead to bed defluidisation. The same chapter includes a presentation of biomass fluidised bed gasification technology for power production in advanced combined cycles and in CHP installations. In Chapter 3, the design and construction of the experimental fluidised bed installation of the Laboratory of Steam Boilers and Thermal Plants is described. In Chapter 4 the gasification trials of three biomass fuels are described: <b>olive</b> <b>kernel,</b> sweet sorghum and cane, representative of the species that flourish in Greece. The parameters investigated were air stoichiometry (λ), gasification temperature as well as the composition of the fuels in the main structural materials (lignin, cellulose) towards final composition of gas and the tar content. Quartz sand and olivine were used as bed material. The experimental results were compared with the results of a pseudo-kinetic model in order to forecast and evaluate the product gas composition of biomass gasification. Chapter 5 presents the experimental investigation of defluidisation observed during the fluidised bed biomass gasification trials and the evaluation of the observations with the determination of the balance among the formed phases of the chemical system. Multiple samples of agglomerated bed material were analyzed with SEM/EDS (scanning electron microscopy /energy dispersive spectrometry) giving information with regard to the composition of the melt, the thickness of coating and the form of the agglomerates, enlightening thus the mechanism of loss of fluidisation. Finally, thermodynamic balance calculations were realised aiming at the evaluation of the observed phenomena. In Chapter 6 a small scale biomass air gasification CHP unit with solid oxide (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell - SOFC) is analysed both energetically and exergetically for a power range up to 1 MWe, for two levels of the systems’ operation pressure. The efficiencies are determined for the more important steps of the process {{as well as for the}} system as a whole. Finally, in Chapter 7 the basic conclusions of the thesis are summarised and further investigation subjects are proposed. ...|$|E
