5|$|Habitat types include polar, temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical. The terrestrial {{vegetation type}} may be forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. Fresh water habitats include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and estuaries, and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, reefs, bays, the <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents.|$|E
5|$|Littlehampton and its harbour were guarded from naval {{attack by}} Littlehampton Redoubt {{on the western}} bank {{at the mouth of}} the river, {{completed}} in 1854, which is now screened from the <b>open</b> <b>sea</b> by Climping sand dunes. This fort replaced a seven-gun battery on the east bank, which was built in 1764.|$|E

50|$|Gradually, however, {{countries}} {{agreed that}} the <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> {{should be free to}} all shipping in peacetime and to neutral shipping in wartime. Great Britain accepted the principle in 1805; Russia, in 1824; and the United States (tacitly) in 1894. Many treaties, including the Treaty of Versailles, have dealt with the <b>open</b> <b>seas,</b> and currently the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea formalizes this freedom.|$|R

5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} of the <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E

5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} on the <b>open</b> <b>sea</b> {{and did not}} affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E

The course lasts {{for several months}} and covers long distance Dives, Swims and Kayaks in <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> often in poor weather. Underwater demolitions, Maritime counter terrorism, are also practised. On completing SBS troopers will be put on one year probation.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the <b>open</b> <b>sea.</b> British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the <b>Open</b> <b>Sea</b> wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
