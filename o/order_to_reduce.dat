5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> drag while swimming.

Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced {{at the bottom and}} at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E

The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
