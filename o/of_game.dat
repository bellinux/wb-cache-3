40|$|The Massive Ordnance Penetrator(MOP) {{has been}} {{developed}} to destroy deeply buried nuclear components by controlled release from a B 2 or B 52 airplane. This type of release must be cockpit software controlled by the Tactical Optimal Strategy Game(TOSG) Protocol to optimally determine the war <b>game</b> aspects <b>of</b> the dueling from other countries' MOP releases, and the depth at which the MOP explosions can occur for maximal safety and risk concerns. The TOSG Protocol characteristics <b>of</b> <b>games</b> <b>of</b> strategy, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> optimal strategy and tactical games are defined initially by the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy as a certain series of events, each of which must have {{a finite number of}} distinct results. The outcome <b>of</b> a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy, in some cases, depends on chance. All other events depend on the free decision of the players. A game has a solution if there exist two strategies, which become optimal strategies when each mathematically attains the value <b>of</b> the <b>game.</b> The TOSG Protocol war game tactical problem for a class <b>of</b> <b>games</b> can be mathematically modeled as a combat between two airplanes, each carrying a MOP as the specification of the accuracy of the firing machinery and the total amount of ammunition that each plane carries. This silent duel occurs, because each MOP bomber is unable to determine the number of times its opponent has missed. The TOSG Protocol realizes a <b>game</b> theory solution <b>of</b> the tactical optimal strategy game utilizing the theory <b>of</b> <b>games</b> <b>of</b> timing, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> pursuit, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> time lag, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> sequence, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> maneuvering, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> search, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> positioning and <b>games</b> <b>of</b> aiming and evasion.
