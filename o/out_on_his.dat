5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted to strike <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} {{an exit strategy}} of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E

5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find himself again.|$|E

5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> last expedition.|$|E

In 1904, Tan struck <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own, selling pineapples and rice and {{manufacturing}} rubber tyres and shoes. Tan's rubber business flourished and, with growing wealth, he altruistically donated money to many schools and established Amoy University (now Xiamen University). However, Tan's loyalty still lay with his motherland and he ardently supported opponents of the Qing rulers during the Xinhai Revolution. By this time, Tan's philanthropic work and political inclinations had made him a popular figure amongst the Chinese in Singapore and China.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, {{he moved to}} Britain, where he would live {{for most of the}} rest of his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar.

5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E

They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing.

Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E
5|$|Magnus {{accompanied}} {{his father}} in Harald's campaign against Denmark in 1062. On his way to Denmark, Harald's fleet clashed with the fleet of Danish king Sweyn Estridsson in a major naval battle at Niså that resulted in Norwegian victory. In 1066, after concluding peace with Sweyn Estridsson, Harald set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> campaign of conquering England from Harold Godwinson.

After initial success in the Battle of Fulford, Harald was defeated and killed by Harold Godwinson in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Olaf survived and returned to Norway with the remaining troops in early 1067, and was proclaimed king and co-ruler with his brother Magnus.|$|E
