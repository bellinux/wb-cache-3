5|$|Although {{defeated}} in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one for years to come. Landon had received some 6,000 letters commiserating {{with him in his}} defeat; Willkie received over 100,000. Financially independent, he was in no hurry to decide among the many <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> from top law firms and major corporations. He resumed his affair with Van Doren.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> that would merely have traded on his name, and instead {{accepted}} {{the post of}} college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E
25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend as much time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E

500|$|As {{he waited}} for <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a women's college at Oxford and {{entitled}} Michaelmas Term at St Bride's, but did not finish it: [...] "All literary inspiration has deserted me", he informed Amis on 13 August. Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled Jill, about [...] "a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and {{falls in love with}} her". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, [...] "Bliss", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom. [...] As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that [...] "Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls' school stories". This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto [...] "What Are We Writing For", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, [...] "to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth".|$|E
500|$|After {{a second}} term as governor, Roosevelt was elected President of the United States in November 1932, {{assuming}} the office in March 1933. LeHand accompanied the Roosevelts to the White House, where {{she became the first}} woman to serve as a presidential secretary and the only female member of the four-person [...] "secretariat" [...] that managed the West Wing. (The other three were Louis McHenry Howe, Steve Early and Marvin H. McIntyre. Missy earned half the salary of the men.) As her obituary in the New York Times said, [...] "when her employer was elected to the Presidency, it had become an established fact that neither other <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> or proposals of marriage could entice the prematurely gray and handsome young woman from the career she had chosen." [...] During Roosevelt's tenure as president, LeHand became a federal employee. Until the 1941 stroke that incapacitated her, she lived {{on the third floor of}} the White House and continued to manage Roosevelt's daily business, also presiding as the White House hostess during Eleanor's absences. In August 1933, Newsweek ran a profile of her describing her as FDR's [...] "Super-Secretary", making her nationally famous. She also appeared on the cover of Time magazine in December 1934, one of just three women to grace a Time cover that year. In 1937 she was listed as one of the best-dressed women in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|In the novel, a {{group of}} people are lured into coming to an island under {{different}} pretexts, e.g., <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> to enjoy a late summer holiday, or to meet old friends.

The guests and two servants who are present are [...] "charged" [...] with their respective [...] "crimes" [...] by a gramophone recording after dinner the first night, and informed that they have been brought to the island to pay for their actions. They are the only people on the island, and cannot escape due to the distance from the mainland and the inclement weather, and gradually all ten are killed in turn, each in a manner that seems to parallel the deaths in the nursery rhyme. Nobody else seems to be left alive on the island {{by the time of the}} apparent last death. A confession, in the form of a postscript to the novel, unveils how the killings took place and who was responsible.|$|E

[...] After much infighting among the trustees and inaction from then Chair of the Board Donna Cansfield to make an appointment to fill the vacant trustee seat left by Basra, a by-election was called for April 2002 costing the board $160,000.00. [...] Stan Nemiroff defeated former Mayor of Etobicoke Bruce Sinclair in the by-election to become the new Ward 1 trustee representing Etobicoke North.|$|E
6000|$|But Cæsar {{had already}} done great things in Gaul. He had {{defeated}} the Helvetians and driven Ariovistus out of the country. He had carried eight legions among the distant Belgæ, and had conquered the Nervii. In this very year he had built a huge fleet, and had destroyed the Veneti, a seafaring people {{on the coast of}} the present Brittany. The more powerful he showed himself to be, the more difficult it was to recall him; but also the more desirable in the eyes of many. In the first portion of his speech Cicero handles Piso and Gabinius with his usual invective. There was no considerable party desirous of renewing to them their governments, but Cicero always revelled in the pleasure of abusing them. He devotes by far the longer part of his oration to the merit of Cæsar.[19] As for recalling him, it would be irrational. Who had counted more enemies in Rome than Marius? but did they recall Marius when he was fighting for the Republic?[20] Hitherto the Republic had been forced to fear the Gauls. Rome had always been on the defence against them. Now it had been brought about by Cæsar that the limits of the world were the limits of the Roman Empire.[21] The conquest was not yet finished, but surely it should be left to him who had begun it so well. Even though Cæsar were to demand to return himself, thinking that he had done enough for his own glory, it would be for the Senators to restrain him--for the Senate to bid him finish the work that he had in hand.[22] As for himself, continued Cicero, if Cæsar had been his enemy, what of that? Cæsar was not his enemy now. He had told the Senate what <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> Cæsar had made him. If he could not forget, yet he would forgive, former injuries.[23] ...|$|E
