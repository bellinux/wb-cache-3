40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> {{infrastructure}} in the presence of agglomeration economies. Cross-border infrastructure is more likely to increase than to decrease inequalities between and within regions, and has not helped regional convergence in Europe. Under-investment due to spillovers, coordination failures, and the inadequacy of networks originally designed for national markets provide a role for supranational institutions. Hub-andspoke networks tend to increase urban primacy while <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> connections tend to reduce it. Improvements in transport and communication allow firms to separate innovation, management and production, increasing efficiency and urban interdependence. transport; cross-border infrastructure; agglomeration; urban specialization...|$|R

40|$|Lack of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> supply has {{repeatedly}} {{been blamed for}} the fact that national borders limit spatial interaction and, consequently, the growth of border regions. This study applies an accessibility approach to investigate for most municipalities in ten countries in mainland West Europe if foreign transport supply is lagging behind, and if population growth in these municipalities has been affected by the limits that national borders have imposed on market access. To do so, data describing historical population changes and road networks between 1961 and 2011 have been used. The results show that in the study area, <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> accessibility was not at a disadvantage in 1961 and has since then grown even more than domestic accessibility. However, municipal population growth has depended almost exclusively on domestic market access. Processes of economic international integration in the study area are found to coincide with the growth of cross-border accessibility, but do not have a clear coincidence with the effects of cross-border accessibility on population growth.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the {{deregulation of the}} international road transport industry in Western Europe has affected 1 - the total quantity of <b>cross-border</b> road <b>transport</b> in the region; 2 - {{the degree to which}} shippers outsource rather than integrate vertically their <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> needs; and 3 - the extent to which different countries participate in international road freight transport in Western Europe. Not surprisingly, we find that deregulation has had a large positive effect on the amount of international road transport net of the effect of the trade ties that grew over time among European Union countries. Moreover, consistent {{with the fact that the}} regulation disproportionately affected for-hire trucking, we find that deregulation has led shippers to shift toward more for-hire transport as opposed to own-account or private haulage. However, despite concerns voiced by member countries, we find no evidence that deregulation has disproportionately favored carriers of countries that were initially more (or less) intensively involved in international haulage...|$|R

In the present study, two regional haze episodes over east China {{in the spring}} of 2011 were examined by observations and simulations conducted by a three-dimensional regional chemical transport model (NAQPMS) with an on-line tracer-tagged module. The model reproduced accurately the observed PM 2. 5 with correlation coefficient ranging from 0. 52 to 0. 76 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 20 &#x 2013; 50 &#x 00 B 5;g/m 3 in four city clusters (Yangtze River Delta, Shandong Peninsula, Huabei Plain and Central Liaoning) over east China. Our results indicate that a northward <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport</b> from the Yangtze River Delta to Central Liaoning below 2 km above ground {{played an important role in}} the formation of these regional high PM 2. 5 episodes.

Data {{obtained}} in Hong Kong during the Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Pilot Air Monitoring Study in autumn 2002 are analyzed {{to unravel the}} relationship between ground-level ozone (O 3), pollution precursors, and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport.</b> Ten ozone episodes, during which the hourly O 3 concentration exceeded 100 ppbv in 9 cases and 90 ppbv in one case, are subject to detailed analysis, including one case with hourly O 3 of 203 ppbv, which is the highest concentration on record to date in Hong Kong. Combined with high-resolution back trajectories, dCO/dNOy (the ratio of enhancement of CO concentration above background to that of NOy) is used to define whether O 3 is locally or regionally produced.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) {{is subject to}} costly, additional veterinary measures. Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for such}} additional cross-border measures can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine veterinary measures (standard measures that apply to both domestic and <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport)</b> and additional <b>cross-border</b> measures (extra measures that only apply to <b>cross-border</b> <b>transport)</b> as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of additional cross-border measures. The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine veterinary measures and additional cross-border measures for the cross-border region was € 22. 1 million, 58 % (€ 12. 7 million) of which came from additional cross-border measures. Two-thirds of this € 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were veterinary checks on animals (twice in the case of slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four additional cross-border measures met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save € 8. 2 million (€ 5. 0 million for NL and € 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is subject to measures, such as veterinary checks {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of additional cross-border measures in both countries...|$|R
