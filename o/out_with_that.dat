25|$|King Philip had a {{turbulent}} history, {{including at least}} two mutinies or sailors' rebellions, with the ship surviving being set on fire on both of those occasions. Finally, on January 25, 1878, 22 years after she was built, King Philip left San Francisco Bay under Captain A.W. Keller, bound for Port Gamble, carrying no cargo. A steam-powered tugboat had towed {{her out of the}} Bay, in order to help her maneuver in the dangerous waters. At that exact moment, an accident caused the death of the captain of a ship that was nearby, and the tugboat crew was called upon to help <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> emergency. Left on her own without the tugboat to steer her, King Philip dropped an anchor, but the anchor did not hold fast, and the clipper drifted with the current towards the breakers of the beach and ran aground in heavy surf, which caused the ship to break apart.|$|E

After doing well in Dallas, he was sent to auditions in California and finally got the part. He commented that [...] "Javier is a very good friend to Akeelah ... And also like his charisma, his character, he can always put a smile on your face. He really doesn't care what people think of him that much and he helps Akeelah <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> little matter because she cares very much of what people think about her." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Will Jacobs {{suggests}} the Silver Age ended in April 1970 {{when the man}} who had started it, Julius Schwartz, handed over Green Lantern — starring one of the first revived heroes of the era [...] — to the new-guard team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams in response to reduced sales. John Strausbaugh also connects the end of the Silver Age to Green Lantern. He observes that in 1960, the character embodied the can-do optimism of the era. [...] However, by 1972 Green Lantern had become world weary; [...] "Those days are gone – gone forever – the days I was confident, certain ... I was so young ... so sure I couldn't make a mistake! Young and cocky, that was Green Lantern. Well, I've changed. I'm older now ... maybe wiser, too ... and a lot less happy." [...] Strausbaugh writes that the Silver Age [...] "went <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> whimper." ...|$|E

500|$|Achtung Baby was U2's {{first album}} {{in three years}} and their first {{comprising}} entirely new material in over four years. The group maintained a low profile after the record's release, avoiding interviews and allowing critics and the public {{to make their own}} assessments. Instead of participating in an article with Rolling Stone magazine, U2 asked Eno to write one for them. The marketing plan for the album focused on retail and press promotions. In addition to television and radio advertisements being produced, posters featuring the sleeve's 16images were distributed to record stores and through alternative newspapers in major cities. Compared to the large hype of other 1991 year-end releases, the marketing for Achtung Baby was relatively understated, as Island general manager Andy Allen explained: [...] "U2 will not come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> kind of fanfare in terms of outside media. We feel the fan base itself creates that kind of excitement." ...|$|E
500|$|M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold {{states that}} Iron Maiden [...] "are {{by far the}} best live band in the world and their music is timeless", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy {{comments}} that [...] "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist". Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor says that [...] "Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{commented on}} the simple {{structure}} and themes of the video, writing [...] "There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes." [...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> famous eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you longing for a sip of eggnog." ...|$|E

500|$|Rhys' mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), was {{introduced}} in November 2011. Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys {{is the way he}} is". He added that there would be [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While they wonder who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> He realises, and feels terrible." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} hiatus, de Pablo {{admitted}} that she was to a point tired of the producers teasing the pairing and said, [...] "I wish the writers would just {{make it easy for}} us and just say, 'You know, go into the elevator and kiss passionately.' Or, [...] say, 'I don't like you.'" [...] She added, [...] "But I've always thought that, deep inside, Tony loves Ziva and Ziva loves Tony, but she's almost ashamed of saying it because he's so stupid. In the best of ways. That personal that he comes <b>out</b> <b>with,</b> <b>that</b> frat boy thing -- he's hiding constantly from the truth. It's just a big facade and she sees right through it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Canadian tech-metal band Out of Your Mouth {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Music" [...] as their debut single.

In 2007, The Dynamics {{released a}}n eight-minute soul cover on their album Versions Excursions. French metal band Eths added a cover of the song as a bonus track on their third studio album III (2012). In addition, remixed eurodance cover versions of the song have appeared on the Dancemania series albums, including an uptempo cover remix by Nancy And The Boys on the 2001 album Dancemania Speed 6.|$|E

2500|$|Prosecutors also allege Hicks {{was interviewed}} by Muhammad Atef, an al-Qaeda {{military}} commander, about his background and [...] "the travel habits of Australians". In a memoir that was later repudiated by its author, the Guantanamo detainee Feroz Abbasi claimed Hicks was [...] "Al-Qaedah's 24 [...] Golden Boy" [...] and [...] "obviously the favourite recruit" [...] of their al-Qaeda trainers during exercises at the al-Farouq camp near Kandahar. The memoir {{made a number of}} claims, including that Hicks was teamed in the training camp with Filipino recruits from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and that, during internment in Camp X-Ray, Hicks allegedly described his desire to [...] "go back to Australia and rob and kill Jews ... crash a plane into a building" [...] and to [...] "go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> last big adrenaline rush." ...|$|E

[...] Many artists who have been influenced by Iron Maiden hold their artwork in high regard, with Joey Jordison, former member of Slipknot commenting that he bought his first album [...] "on the strength of the cover alone" [...] and Corey Taylor, also of Slipknot, stating that [...] "there wasn't a dude that I hung <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks."

2500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Prince Henry {{is trying}} to {{convince}} his daughter, Regina, still after Snow White's heart, to give up vengeance, but she is unable {{to let go of}} her anger. He turns to the Magic Mirror in desperation to speak with Cora, believing {{that the best way to}} force Regina to get over Snow White is to just help her complete her plot, which Prince Henry is not in favor of. Unknown to Prince Henry and Regina, Cora has managed to enter the realm of the Enchanted Forest through the mirror again. Later on, Prince Henry meets with Snow White in the woods. When she sees the real Prince Henry approaching her, she realizes that the first Prince Henry was actually Cora, who rips out her heart while she is distracted. Cora takes Snow's heart to Regina as a birthday present, only to then learn that Snow switched it <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of a guard. It turned out that Prince Henry saved Snow White by switching the hearts. A furious Regina then shrinks her father and condemns him into the very box that was holding the heart. Regina confronts Cora and sends her mother back into the mirror and seals it forever. [...] At the last minute Cora takes the box containing her husband so Regina will be truly alone.|$|E
