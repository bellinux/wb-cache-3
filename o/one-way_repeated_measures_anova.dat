Methodology: The study comprised of one group of thirty participants (n= 30), 21 males and 9 females, who were between the ages of 19 - 36, who had sleep disturbance and mechanical neck. All participants received cervical manipulative therapy (CMT), twice a week for three weeks. Subjective data was collected in the form of a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) which measured sleep quality and a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) which measured the pain intensity. Objective data was collected using a cervical range of motion (CROM) device, twice a week for three weeks. Procedure: Shapiro-Wilk test was used for normal distribution of data. <b>One-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA</b> tests were conducted in order to investigate if any significant difference exist among the visits (visit 1, visit 4 and visit 7) for all variables measured in this study. Where statistical significant differences exists, Pairwise Comparisons were performed to check where the difference lies. Results: <b>One-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA</b> revealed the p-value (p < 0. 05) to be statistically significant for the PSQI, NPRS and CROM data obtained from this study. <b>One-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA</b> also revealed PSQI, NPRS and CROM to have favourable results from visit 1 to visit 7. Conclusion: The overall results were favourable as the participants had neck pain relief, increased cervical range of motion and improvement in their sleep quality following CMT. Due to the small sample size, it is however not clear if CMT had a direct effect on sleep quality or if the improvement in the participants sleep quality was due to a reduction in the participant’s neck pain intensity.

Fifteen recreational runners with patellofemoral pain ran on an instrumented treadmill while three-dimensional motion capture data were acquired. Peak patellofemoral joint stress, joint reaction force, knee extensor moment and knee joint angle during the stance phase of running were calculated. <b>One-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA</b> was used to compare the control condition (1) to the three experimental conditions (2 - 4). Running in a minimalist shoe at an increased cadence reduced patellofemoral stress and joint reaction force on average by approximately 29 % (...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of speed and {{concurrent}} visual feedback on mean peak torque values at dynamometer speed of 45 and 120 degrees per second to determine if a significant increase or decrease in the force-velocity relationship exists. The dominant limb of thirty male subjects between the ages of 18 and 35 were tested eccentrically on the KIN-COM dynamometer. All data were analyzed by three one-way repeated measures ANOVAs. The results revealed no significant differences in mean peak eccentric torque during three continuous concentric-eccentric contractions between 45 and 120 degrees per second (p 3 ̆e. 05). A <b>one-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA</b> revealed no significant differences in mean peak torque at 120 degrees per second with and without concurrent visual feedback (p 3 ̆e. 05), but revealed a significant increase in mean peak torque at 45 degrees per second with concurrent visual feedback (p=. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) programme for typing skill training for people with mild-grade mental handicap (MH). MethodsEighteen participants with mild-grade MH were recruited in this pilot study. Each participant was given the training once every week for a total of 3 weeks, each session lasting for 90 minutes. The training programme was a CAI programme with visual search strategies to enhance typing skills of people with MH. Their typing abilities were assessed before the training, and 1 week and 4 weeks after the training programme. Using <b>one-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> <b>ANOVA,</b> typing speed and accuracy rate were compared. ResultsSignificant differences were found on typing speed and accuracy (p < 0. 001) after the 3 -week CAI programme. High levels of accuracy and significant improvement in typing speed might indicate that automatic processing might have occurred. ConclusionThis study supported the role of visual search strategies and demonstrated a positive effective of CAI in enhancing functional performance among people with MH...|$|E
40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 7 (4) : 271 - 277, 2014. Stretching before {{performing}} anaerobic {{activity has}} been a highly debated subject, with studies finding differing results {{depending on the type}} (static, dynamic, etc.) and duration of the stretch. Furthermore, the effects of dynamic stretching (DS) on anaerobic performance have been minimally researched. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects a DS protocol had on power performance using a Wingate test (WAnT). College-aged male subjects were recruited for this study. Prior to experimental trials, subjects performed a familiarity WAnT trial. Subjects then performed the WAnT two more times, once with DS and once without stretching (NS), in a balanced cross-over design. Relative peak power (RPP), relative mean power (RMP), fatigue index (FI), and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) means were compared across DS and NS trials using <b>one-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> <b>ANOVA’s,</b> α = 0. 05. No significant differences (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) were found across DS and NS protocols among RPP, FI, and RPE. However, there was a significant difference (p =. 043) in mean RMP between the DS protocol and NS treatment. These findings suggest that some forms of dynamic stretching may significantly decrease mean power during anaerobic performance. More research is needed to explore the different combinations and duration of dynamic stretching needed to illicit a positive response...|$|R
40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 6 (2) : 114 - 125, 2013. Weightlifters have {{commonly}} {{believed that}} changing joint position can alter specific muscle activation. The magnitude of force {{produced by a}} muscle is highly dependent upon {{the length of the}} muscle. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of foot positioning on muscle activation of the superficial quadriceps as measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) during a functional squatting movement in healthy adults. Twenty physically active asymptomatic adults (7 females and 13 males) were included in the study while four different foot positions (Neutral, Internally Rotated, Externally Rotated, and Staggered) were assessed. Three quadriceps muscles (Rectus Femoris (RF), Vastus Medialis Oblique (VMO), and Vastus Lateralis Oblique(VLO) were measured. Raw EMG was transformed using a root mean square algorithm. Six <b>one-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> <b>ANOVAs</b> were conducted to examine the peak and average RMS amplitude for each muscle across each condition, with an alpha level of 0. 05 set a priori. Across all foot positions only the Staggered foot position reached statistical significance when compared to all other foot positions for each muscle group. Results suggest that altering the foot position during a partial weight squat has little to no effect on the EMG amplitudes of the quadriceps. However, more research is needed to examine the concentric and eccentric phases of the squatting motion separately with the addition of full weight bearing squats...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to: (1) apply the critical power (CP) model to heart rate (HR) data to propose a HR based analog of the CP test called the critical heart rate (CHR) test; (2) compare the CHR to HR values at CP (CPHR), ventilatory threshold (VT 1 HR), and respiratory compensation point (VT 2 HR); and (3) examine the V 2 ̆ 6 dot;O 2, RPE, EMG, and MMG responses to 1 -hr continuous rides at the CHR, CHR+ 5 bpm, and CHR- 5 bpm. Ten women performed an incremental test to exhaustion to determine V 2 ̆ 6 dot;O 2 peak, VT 1, VT 2, VT 1 HR, and VT 2 HR The subjects also performed four exhaustive workbouts at different power outputs (P) to determine CP and CHR. For each P, the total number of heart beats (HBlim) was calculated as the product of the average 5 -second HR (bpm) and total time to exhaustion (T lim in min). The HBlim and total work (Wlim in kgm) were plotted {{as a function of the}} Tlim at each P and the slope coefficients of the regression lines between HBlim or Wlim and Tlim were defined as the CHR and CP, respectively. The mathematical model used for the determination of CP was applicable to HR measurements to estimate the CHR. A <b>one-way</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> <b>ANOVA</b> indicated that CHR (175 ± 11 bpm, 92. 6 ± 2. 8...|$|R
