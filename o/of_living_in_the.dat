5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi.

This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E
5|$|Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and {{following}} a two-year constitutional convention it became independent in 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt.

Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v.Australia led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.|$|E

5|$|These {{sedentary}} peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing {{logging and}} harvesting of other resources {{on a large}} scale. The construction of irrigation canals {{may have led to}} a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and Chaco were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large floodplains. In time, flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into arroyos, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14thcentury A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of the Hopi, Zuni, Laguna and Acoma people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado River basin at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region or migrated in from bordering lands.|$|E
