Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> further reduced prices. In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E
5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose to hold on to him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 percent of his shots on net.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production.

40|$|Background: Social {{inclusion}} is {{an issue}} for persons with intellectual disability; the group often suffer from discrimination <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> labour <b>market</b> and are subject to social exclusion. Persons with intellectual disability {{have the right to}} daily activities that have the intention to lead to an employment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> labour <b>market.</b> By exploring and identifying issues regarding social inclusion for persons with intellectual disabilities at daily activities, there is a possibility to lift forward the voice of an excluded group. The results of this study can serve as information about the current status of social inclusion at daily activities centres. Objective: To investigate if and how daily activities for persons with intellectual disabilities can lead to social inclusion. Methods: Five supervisors that work alongside persons with intellectual disabilities at the daily activities centre were interviewed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data material gathered. Results: Activities to enhance social inclusion did not take place at the daily activities centres. Persons with intellectual disabilities had severe difficulties to achieve an employment on equal terms as persons without disabilities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> labour <b>market.</b> Conclusion: In order to achieve a higher degree of social inclusion for persons with intellectual disabilities at the daily activities centre following is needed; individual planning, a high degree of service user influence and sufficient financial- and human resources...|$|R
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the REO bid to develop the site, in February 2012, Battersea Power Station was put up for sale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> {{for the first time in}} its history. The sale was {{conducted}} by commercial estate agent Knight Frank on behalf of the site's creditors. In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings' Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London & Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley. If sold, the new owner would have to pay £500 million for the power station, including £325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds, and a £100 million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale is unsuccessful, the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve the site in line with its listed status.|$|E

Pixar released some of its software tools <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> for Macintosh and Windows systems.

5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> as a way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, and Suddenly, Last Summer. Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, NetBank {{recognized}} {{that there were}} some significant operating deficiencies and started to restructure the company in an effort to resume profitability.

The independent auditor, Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>markets.</b> Some of <b>the</b> loans that NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks. Since the loans that did not meet the underwriting guidelines were often past-due loans, NetBank was forced to repurchase a many failed loans that it had written. This loss of capital was very harmful to the company's equity position and was the first clue to the bank's poor financial position.|$|R
