50|$|As a spekkoek {{commonly}} {{has more}} than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring {{a small amount of}} batter into a baking tin, which is then put into an <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> <b>grilled</b> from above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then removed from the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.|$|R
30|$|When cooking on a {{barbecue}} grill, consumers often use aluminum grill pans. For one, the pan catches the {{fats and oils}} that would drip into the embers causing the formation of potentially noxious smoke, and the pan also protects the food from being burned by direct heat from the coals. In addition, new aluminum products for use in <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> <b>grills</b> are becoming increasingly popular. Due to their light weight and excellent heat transfer camping, utensils made of aluminum are, for example, often used by fishermen and mountain climbers. Preparing food in aluminum utensils can, however, result in migration of the aluminum to the foodstuffs.|$|R

Combi steamers replace practically all conventional industrial-scale cooking appliances, such as convection <b>ovens,</b> stoves, pots <b>and</b> <b>grills.</b> They combine the advantages of steaming (e.g., short cooking times, low cooking loss levels, juiciness) with those of convection heat (e.g., intense flavor, appetizing color, crisp crusts).|$|R
40|$|The broiler {{industry}} has a variable meat texture issue known as woody breast. This research compares quality attributes of normal (NOR) and severe woody breast (SWB) in 3 experiments. The objective of Experiment I was {{to evaluate the}} quality traits of marinated NOR and SWB fillets and their effect on tenderness. A total of 333 fillets were categorized into NOR (n = 180, flexible through the fillet) and SWB (n = 153, rigid through the fillet). Quality traits (drip loss and cook loss %) and tenderness measurements (Warner Bratzler shear force and sarcomere length) were evaluated. SWB fillets had higher drip loss % and higher cook loss % compared to normal fillets (P 0. 05). Sensory texture attributes were higher for SWB than NOR fillets (P < 0. 05) and crunchiness and fibrousness were the main texture attributes to describe SWB fillets. In Experiment III, both <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> <b>grill</b> cooking methods were used to evaluate TPA to determine differences between NOR and SWB either stored fresh (4 ? C) or frozen (- 29 ? C). No {{differences were found in}} cooking methods. TPA of SWB was higher than NOR in fresh and frozen storage (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, storage temperature and cooking method do not influence the texture of SWB. Crunchy and fibrous are better descriptors for SWB meat instead of tough. TPA is a fast and reliable method to measure texture in chicken breast and is comparable to descriptive sensory results...|$|R

50|$|Lowe's began a year-long, $15 million {{renovation}} in March 2014. Refurbishment {{began with}} the two-level rooftop pool, which received a new lounge area, cooking <b>grills,</b> <b>and</b> <b>furniture.</b> Company officials said phase two of the renovation would occur in November 2014, when the hotel's 231 rooms and its common areas will be refurbished with new electronics, furnishings, and wallpaper. The second phase will also relocate the main lobby from the below-ground level to the first floor. Renovation of the first floor will also include {{the construction of a}} bar and quick-serve restaurant/coffee bar (which will serve take-away as well as plated items). The main entrance will be replaced {{in order to make the}} restaurant more accessible to non-guests. In addition to relocating the lobby, the below-ground meeting spaces on the lower level will also be renovated. Company officials said the construction and renovation should be complete by March 2015, after which room price increases are likely to be implemented.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric cooking ranges, hobs, <b>ovens,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grills</b> for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of <b>ovens,</b> hobs, <b>and</b> kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a significant environmental aspect in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R
50|$|Cooking {{along the}} trail was {{typically}} done over a campfire dug {{into the ground and}} made of wood, dried buffalo chips, willow or sagebrush—whatever was easily available. After a rain the 'Buffalo chips' were often hard to start on fire. Flint and steel or matches were used to start fires. Cooking equipment was typically light and included only simple cooking utensils such as butcher knives, forks, metal plates and cups, spoons, large spoons, spatulas, ladles, Dutch <b>ovens,</b> pots <b>and</b> pans, <b>grills,</b> spits, coffee pots, pot hooks and an iron tripod to suspend the pans and pots over the fire. Some brought small stoves, but these were often jettisoned along the way as too heavy and unnecessary. The usual meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner eaten by the mostly male Argonauts (many didn't want to or know how to cook) was bacon/ham, beans, coffee and biscuits/bread/corn bread or flapjacks.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the influence of various cooking methods - conventional oven, microwave <b>oven,</b> electric <b>grill</b> <b>and</b> pan-frying on the composition and physicochemical characteristics of restructured beef steaks formulated as low fat (L, 2. 0 % fat), medium fat (M, 13. 0 % fat) and 20 % added walnut (W, 12. 6 % fat). Composition, retention coefficients for different compounds, cooking loss (CL) and texture were affected by both formulation and cooking. There was considerable retention of moisture, fat and minerals (as ash) in W samples after cooking. CL was highest (P 90 %) was greatest {{in the case of the}} W sample, thus assuring that the ultimate objective of these restructured meats, namely to provide a source of walnut and walnut fat, would be successful. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
