40|$|AbstractSince 2007, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) {{has been}} {{collecting}} biomonitoring {{data from the}} general Canadian population and has provided, to date, nationally representative concentrations for hundreds of environmental biomarkers in blood or urine. Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) have been developed as tools to help interpret biomonitoring data in a health risk context at a population level. In this paper, BEs are used to relate biomonitoring data from the CHMS (2007 – 2011) to existing exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> developed by Health Canada and other government agencies. Chemical-specific hazard quotients (HQs) and/or cancer risk estimates are calculated using existing BEs corresponding to environmental chemicals analyzed in the CHMS. For the majority of environmental chemicals, calculated HQ values are less than 1 indicating exposure is below published exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values.</b> Individual biomonitoring data for two biomarkers of metal exposure (inorganic arsenic and cadmium) resulted in HQ values exceeding 1 suggesting that exposure may be above existing <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> {{for a portion of}} the population, at least intermittently.

40|$|Evaluation of {{a larger}} number of {{chemicals}} in commerce from the perspective of potential human health risk has become a focus of attention in North America and Europe. Screening-level chemical risk assessment evaluations consider both exposure and hazard. Exposures are increasingly being evaluated through biomonitoring studies in humans. Interpreting human biomonitoring results requires comparison to toxicity <b>guidance</b> <b>values.</b> However, conventional chemical-specific risk assessments result in identification of toxicity-based exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> such as tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) as applied doses that cannot directly be used to evaluate exposure information provided by biomonitoring data in a health risk context. This paper describes a variety of approaches for development of screening-level exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> with translation from an external dose to a biomarker concentration framework for interpreting biomonitoring data in a risk context. Applications of tools and concepts including biomonitoring equivalents (BEs), the threshold of toxicologic concern (TTC), and generic toxicokinetic and physiologically based toxicokinetic models are described.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} {{charged with}} the protection of public health, such as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), must have a reference, or comparison value, upon which to base an evaluation of potential health threat posed by any substance or chemical. The basis, or starting points, for such evaluations may have different names or acronyms, but represent {{more or less the}} same thing. These values for non-carcinogenic endpoints are called oral Reference Doses (RIDs) and inhalation Reference Concentrations (RfCs) by the USEPA, Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) by the FDA, and oral and inhalation Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) by the ATSDR. Too often, however, RIDs, Rfes, MRLs, and ADIs are construed as rigid, threshold limits, above which toxicity is likely to occur. The truth, however, is that these values actually represent levels of a potential toxicant that are highly unlikely to represent any threat to human health over a particular/specified duration of daily exposures. The more frequently these levels are exceeded and the greater the exceedance, the more likely some toxic manifestation is to occur. These guidance/reference values are most definitely not threshold values for the onset of toxicity in any exposed popu lation. Health <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> must be thought of in the context of their intended role as mere screening or trigger values, in which they serve as a tool for assisting in the determination of whether further evaluation of a given potential exposure scenario is warranted.

Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects in the age group of 19 - 35 years, free from temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and occlusal disharmony, with healthy dentition participated in the study. Hanau H 2 (non-arcon type) and Hanau Wide-Vue (arcon type) articulators were programmed for sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> using the same protrusive record made in polysiloxane bite registration material with edge to edge degree of protrusion. The resultant values for both the articulators on either side were compared with values obtained from tracing of digital lateral cephalogram using Kodak Dental imaging Window software 6. 6. 3. 0 -C program. The tabulated data were subjected to statistical analysis, ANOVA (Fishers ′F′ test) for group comparison, Tukey′s HSD test for inter-comparison, student′s unpaired ′t′ test for intra-group comparison, and level of significance (P) was calculated using the same. Results: The mean sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> of the three different groups were found to be very highly significant (P= 0. 001) and highly significant (P= 0. 002) on the right and left sides respectively. There was a very highly significant difference (P= 0. 001) and highly significant difference (P= 0. 003) between the arcon and non-arcon group on the right and left side respectively. No significant difference was found between the arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 284 right, P= 0. 853 left) and a statistically significant difference was found between the non-arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 049 right, P= 0. 015 left). On intragroup comparison there was no statistically significant difference in sagittal condylar values on the right and left sides. Conclusion: The mean difference in the sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> obtained from non-arcon and arcon articulators shows a low level of reproducibility, and no significant difference found in mean sagittal condylar values obtained from arcon articulator and cephalometric tracings indicates replication of sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> from image of articular eminence...|$|R

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex mixtures of organic compounds {{that are often}} found as environmental pollutants. In 2005, the German Stiftung Warentest (a product testing NGO) had detected high levels of PAHs in some tool handles and cable sheaths [1]. To reduce the health risks, <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> for technically unavoidable PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products. In the spring of 2009 TÜV Rheinland examined the PAH concentrations in various products like tool handles, beach sandals and ball horns from do-it-yourself stores and low budget stores. The result: {{in some cases the}} <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> are still considerably exceeded in the consumer products examined for PAHs. According to the knowledge currently available, the BfR must assume that defective products are still being marketed. Such products do not comply with good manufacturing practice and constitute a risk for human health. In general, manufacturers should reduce PAH concentrations in their products as much as possible since no threshold values can be given for some PAHs below which health risks can be excluded. In order to protect consumers from health risks, BfR proposes the setting of statutory limit values for PAHs and BaP.
