In {{an article about}} [...] "Jumanji", Grant Trimboli of Under the Gun Review opined that the song had a [...] "Caribbean vibe". Jonah Weiner, in a contribution to Slate, stated that the song's tempo was [...] "about 80 bpm". Weiner went on to state that the song's tempo was [...] "a relaxed pace", and identified [...] "bomb-tick hi-hats" [...] in the song's composition. Instrumentally, several music critics noted calypso steel drums throughout the song. Sarah Pope of NME opined that the song had [...] "ethereal twinkles of a harp". The song also features Banks rapping [...] "lines about media scandals and keeping true to herself" [...] over a beat likened, by critics, to the works of M.I.A. [...] In {{a review of the}} song for Spin, music critic Marc Hogan noted the use of [...] "elephantine trumpet blares", a [...] "loudly clanging timpani", and clapping on the track every eighth note. Hogan later categorized [...] "Jumanji", along with Barbadian singer Rihanna's [...] "Birthday Cake", and the Big Sean and Nicki Minaj collaboration, [...] "Dance (A$$)", as [...] "clappers".

500|$|The Texian {{position}} {{was surrounded by}} trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver. [...] The 200 members of the cavalry remained {{on the west bank}} of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts. Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. [...] In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. [...] The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 5060 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. [...] Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, [...] "Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!" [...] At [...] from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. [...] They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. [...] For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. [...] According to Texian Noah Smithwick, [...] "grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower <b>of</b> <b>ripe</b> nuts down on us, and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther." [...] In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that [...] "The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect." [...] The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the [...] effective range of the Texian long rifles. [...] The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality. In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim {{from music}} critics. Brittany Mahaney of ANDPOP praised the song's playful demeanor, and called [...] "Jumanji" [...] a summer anthem. Mahaney further elaborated that the song [...] "practically screams summer with dance worthy steel drums and timpani hits". On a similar note, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard also deemed the song an anthem. Lipshutz also compared Banks's {{performance in the}} song to the works of Cam'ron and early Ghostface Killah, claiming it was [...] "a great thing". Using a similar comparison, Jonah Weiner of Slate commented that the song [...] "channels the sort of hip-hop that dominated New York in the early- to mid-'00s—in particular, the triumphal cacophony and inspired gobbledygook of Cam'ron and his Harlem crew, the Diplomats". Weiner went on to commend the track's [...] "comically [...] " [...] percussion, but heavily praised the song's relaxed tempo, stating it [...] "better accommodates kingly rapping". Huw Nolan <b>of</b> <b>Ripe</b> lauded the song, calling it [...] "classic Azealia". Mark Richardson, writing for Pitchfork, gave the song the [...] "Best New Track" [...] honor, stating, [...] "her rapping really functions as the bedrock, the steady pulse for the production (by Hudson Mohawke and Nick Hook) to swirl around". Richardson used the aforementioned metaphor throughout his review, comparing the production on the song to Rustie's mix featured on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix, before ending the review by saying, [...] "She [...] can rap." [...] Reviewing the song's parent mixtape for the same publication, Marc Hogan lauded the [...] " [...] rapidfire verses and an instantly quotable 'real bitch, all day/ Uptown, Broadway' hook over what sounds like elephants escaping from an urban zoo". Placing the song on Pretty Much Amazings [...] "Tracking 2012's Best Songs" [...] list, Genevieve Oliver opined the song exemplified [...] "Azealia's jittery, relentless, rapid-fire energy and smart, sarcastic lyrics" [...] aesthetic. Also writing for Pretty Much Amazing, Drewwmalmuth wrote {{a review of the}} track's parent mixtape, and praised [...] "Jumanji", [...] "Nathan", and [...] "Fuck Up the Fun" [...] for being [...] "commercially viable", but lamented that the tracks weren't [...] "aren't as gripping as the highest points of the tape".|$|E
