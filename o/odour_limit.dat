40|$|Pilot {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the removal of geosmin and 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB) by new and semi-exhausted granular activated carbon (GAC) extracted from full-scale filters located in the City of Toronto’s drinking water treatment facilities. Four pilot filters containing core-sampled GAC and new sand were fed with settled water from a full-scale plant and operated under conditions similar to those employed at full-scale. None of the pilot filters appeared {{to be capable of}} reducing geosmin and MIB concentrations to below the commonly cited threshold <b>odour</b> <b>limits</b> of 4 ng/L for geosmin and 9 ng/L for MIB at the influent levels tested. When operated at a 5 -min empty bed contact time (EBCT) with geosmin influent concentrations in the range of about 70 to 110 ng/L, removals ranged from 10 to 38 % in filters with 25 to 30 cm of used GAC. In the filter with 25 cm of new GAC, removal was 83 %. When operated with a 7. 5 -min EBCT, the filter containing 95 cm of used bituminous GAC removed 78 % of the geosmin present in the influent. For both geosmin and MIB, the efflu-ent concentration and the amount removed increased as influent concentration increased, as was expected. In general, geosmin was better removed than MIB...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of an odour sampling device {{may influence the}} composition of the resulting <b>odour</b> sample. <b>Limited</b> comparison of emission rates derived from turbulent and essentially quiescent sampling devices confirms that the emission rates derived from these devices are quite different. There is therefore compelling evidence that current odour sampling practice should have greater regard for fundamental physical and chemical principles, the nature of the odour source and the conditions created by the sampling device.

40|$|The EU-funded 'Odour {{monitoring}} and information {{system based on}} citizen and technology innovative sensors' ([URL] OMNISCIENTIS) project has made significant inroads in this regard {{with the aim of}} mitigating odour annoyance. To begin with, documents were developed describing the desired specifications for odour measurement, dispersion modelling and information technologies. In parallel, the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including citizens, regulatory authorities and industrial bodies, were taken into consideration. Citizens' feedback on odour acceptability levels were gathered through smartphones and using the living lab approach. They were further combined with measurements from e-nose and odour dispersion models. Project members developed an Odour Information System that produces validated monitoring statistics and impact levels for local authorities to support environment-related decision-making and for citizens to give them feedback on their complaints. A mobile application is also available, used by citizens to perform odour related observations. Over 5000 observations were sent until now. Besides, two in-situ e-nose sensors and a meteorological station were installed and calibrated in the industrial site in Belgium, serving as pilot. Further 18 industrial parameters are collected in real time and 15 odour field surveys have been performed to understand odour sources and characteristics. The e-nose technology was optimised through tests and improvements to better understand relevant odour parameters at the second pilot site, a pig farm in Austria. Researchers adapted the GRAL-System pollutant dispersion model to develop a fast odour dispersion modelling system using harmonised real-time meteorological data and industrial emission measurements. It was validated with the odour emission rates, olfactometry campaigns and citizens observations. Most of the GRAL-solver components were implemented in Cuda with a speed improved by a factor superior of 100. Project activities were disseminated via project website and factsheets, 3 scientific papers, 13 international conferences and 3 user workshops involving selected citizens, technicians and authorities. Local environmental governance was enhanced through citizen empowerment via monthly meetings and specific methodologies. Better and timely feedback on undesirable odours arising from certain emissions will help in setting evidence-based acceptable <b>odour</b> <b>limits.</b> Ultimately, a particular attention have been addressed by all partners and in particular by involved SMEs in order to ensure the exploitation of the results and enabling the identification of concrete commercial opportunities that may be pursued after the project...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIon {{mobility}} spectrometry {{is known}} as fast and sensitive method {{for the detection of}} trace substances and is increasingly in demand not only for the protection against explosives and chemical warfare agents, but also for new applications in medical diagnosis or process control. Generally, a gas phase sample is ionised by help of UV-light, ß-radiation or partial discharges. The ions move in a weak electrical field towards a detector. During their drift they collide with a drift gas flowing in the opposite direction and therefore are slowed down depending on their size, shape and charge. As a result different ions reach the detector at different drift times which are characteristic for the ions considered. The number of ions reaching the detector is a measure for the concentration of the analyte. The method enables the identification and quantification of analytes with high sensitivity (ng/L range). The selectivity can even be increased – as necessary for the analyses of complex mixtures – using pre-separation techniques such as gas-chromatographic or multi-capillary columns. No pre-concentration of the sample is necessary. Those characteristics of the method are preserved even in air with up to 100 % relative humidity. The suitability of the method for application in the field of food quality and safety – including storage, process and quality control as well as characterisation of food stuff – was investigated in recent years for a number of representative examples which are summarized in the following including new studies as well: • detection of metabolites from bacteria for identification and control of their growth. • process control in food production – beer fermentation as an example. • detection of the metabolites of mold for process control during cheese production, for quality control of raw materials or for the control of storage conditions. • quality control of packaging materials during the production of polymeric materials. • characterisation of products – wine as an example. The challenges of such applications were the operation in humid air, fast on-line analyses of complex mixtures, high sensitivity – detection limits have to be e. g. in the range of the <b>odour</b> <b>limits</b> – and in some cases the necessity of mobile instrumentation. It could be shown that ion mobility spectrometry is optimally capable to fulfil those challenges for many applications...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) is a {{biochemical process}} that harnesses the complex metabolic reactions {{of a specific}} community of synergistic microorganisms. Whilst AD is an effective process for deriving energy from purpose-grown biomass, this process also {{plays an important role}} in recovering the energy from organic wastes and capturing and treating the greenhouse gases (GHGs) associated with their disposal in landfill. This chapter outlines the key biochemical reactions involved in the anaerobic digestion of biomass, typical designs and applications and how they are monitored, controlled and optimised. There are four key phases of anaerobic digestion, namely hydrolysis, acidogenesis, ace-togenesis and methanogenesis. Anaerobic digestion is perhaps one of the most common applications for the treatment of sewage sludge as it reduces final sludge volumes, <b>limits</b> <b>odours</b> and destroys pathogens.

50|$|The {{advantages}} of butanol are its high octane rating (over 100) and high energy content, only about 10% lower than gasoline, and subsequently about 50% more energy-dense than ethanol, 100% {{more so than}} methanol. Butanol's only major disadvantages are its high flashpoint (35 °C or 95 °F), toxicity (note that toxicity levels exist but are not precisely confirmed), {{and the fact that}} the fermentation process for renewable butanol emits a foul odour. The Weizmann organism can only tolerate butanol levels up to 2% or so, compared to 14% for ethanol and yeast. Making butanol from oil produces no such <b>odour,</b> but the <b>limited</b> supply and environmental impact of oil usage defeats the purpose of alternative fuels. The cost of butanol is about $1.25-$1.32 per kilogram ($0.57-$0.58 per pound or $4 approx. per US gallon). Butanol is much more expensive than ethanol (approx. $.40 per liter or 1.50 per gallon) and methanol.|$|R
40|$|Odour from {{meat chicken}} (broiler) farms is an {{environmental}} issue affecting the sustainable {{development of the}} chicken meat industry but is {{a normal part of}} broiler production. Odour plumes exhausted from broiler sheds interact with the environment, where dispersion and dilution of the odours varies constantly, especially diurnally. The potential for odour impacts is greatest when odour emission rates are high and/or when atmospheric dispersion and dilution of <b>odour</b> plumes is <b>limited</b> (i. e. during stable conditions). We continuously monitored ventilation rate, on-site weather conditions, atmospheric stability, and estimated odour concentration with an artificial olfaction system. Detailed inspection of odour emission rates at critical times, i. e. dawn, dusk and night time, revealed that maximum daily and batch odour emission rates are not necessarily the cause of odour impacts. Periods of lower odour emission rates on each day are more likely to correspond with odour impacts. Odour emission rates need to be measured at the times when odour impacts are most likely to occur, which is likely to be at night. Additionally, high resolution ventilation rate data should be sought after to improve odour emission models, especially at critical times of the day. Consultants, regulators and researchers need to give more thought to odour emission rates from meat chicken farms to improved prediction and management of odour impacts...|$|R
40|$|Many jurisdictions compare model {{predicted}} {{odour concentration}} statistics against regulatory exposure limits or criteria {{in order to}} assess the risk of proposed developments resulting in nuisance odour impacts. However dose response studies designed to calibrate such criteria have returned widely divergent findings, particularly regarding the degree of influence that the frequency and intensity of odour impact events have on adverse community response (annoyance). In the absence of clear guidance from empirical data, jurisdictions have adopted a wide range of odour impact criteria and harmonisation has proven difficult to progress. This lack of harmonisation constitutes a significant gap in best-practice standards for odour impact assessment methodology and creates a substantial risk of poor assessment outcomes. In this paper a conceptual framework is developed which facilitates close investigation of the relationship between annoyance levels, the frequency and intensity dimensions of nuisance odour and exposure criteria. Within this framework the efficacy of single-percentile <b>odour</b> criteria to <b>limit</b> nuisance <b>odour</b> impacts is examined for several models of annoyance. Significant short-comings in single-percentile criteria are identified in those models in which both the frequency and intensity of impact events are assumed to influence annoyance on time-scales such as a year. The merits and limitations of an alternative multi-percentile criterion framework approach are examined. Models of annoyance developed within the framework suggest an improved concept of odour criteria that may lead to better assessment outcomes, assist with the reconciliation of some seemingly disparate dose response study findings and aid harmonisation of jurisdictional exposure limits...|$|R
40|$|In indoor {{environment}} situations severe <b>odour</b> nuisances often <b>limits</b> or prevents use. This often {{is reason to}} check indoor Air PAH-contamination which mainly derive {{from a variety of}} building material containing coal tar constituents. Today the use of tar as an additive to wood-preservatives, solvents and building material is strongly restricted in Germany (GefStoffV) but other sources for similar odours are fire-events, asphalt and bitumen products. Using a modified VDI method 3875 - 1 including an additional sampling on Polyurethane-foam for analysing air-samples, very variable patterns of single PAH concentrations are obtained which correspond to the source-type. While high concentrations with naphthalene are regularly found indoors, not volatile and rather dust-borne PAH like Benzoapyrene (BaP) rarely occur in concentrations about 2 ng/m. Some PAH have a very high carcinogenic potency in human, some smell intensively. However, as the absence of the characteristic smell does not implicate the absence of PAH, it cannot be used for remediation guidelines and health-concerns remain. For remediation official threshold guideline levels and remediation action criteria are needed. In this course a risk-assessment is proposed using PAH toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) against BaP. Multiplication with measured concentrations and summarising leads to the Cancerogenic Equivalence Sum (KEsum) for the 16 measured PAH. Using data on the additional cancer risk through definite BaP-exposition in the PAH mixture of coking plant gas (unit risk) we can postulate a KEsum of 1, 36 for this gas. On a basis of this scaling we can quantify the additional cancer risk for various air samples. Accepted risks of 10 - 4 and 5 · 10 - 4 lead to guideline values for successful remediation of KEsum = 10. 0. Case studies are shown where the scheme could successfully be applied as the main criteria for building remediations...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life people are simultaneously exposed to several annoying sources (sounds, vibrations and odours), which emerge from background of considerable variability of land uses, infrastructures, residential patterns, topography, meteorology condition, and standards quality of life. The European Union has provided {{in recent years}} (and is going to update) several tools to harmonize noise mapping methodologies and relative Noise Action Plans through directives and guidelines. Unfortunately the same efforts have not been put in the harmonization of approaches in other annoying sources like odours. As a consequence, each European Member State at national or even at local level defined its own direct or indirect approach to <b>limit</b> <b>odour</b> impacts, usually considerably different one from the others. The most common approach to deal with noise impact at a policy, economic and strategy level {{is the use of}} priority indices focused to highlight areas more sensitive and where mitigation actions will be more advisable or urgent. Locations that for their specific land use are more sensitive to noise impacts (e. g. residential areas) are generally also sensitive to odour impacts. According these, the aim of the present research is to provide a brief review of the most used European strategies in noise action plans end try to extend their approaches for the definition of a nuisance action plan, able to control both odour and noise. Paper present a possible implementation of integrated nuisances action plan in the municipality of Palma Campania (Campania Region, Italy). The analysis underlines that is possible define, under the same set of nuisance indicators, the degree of sensitivity of areas according to population, land uses, levels of exposures and/or distance from the annoying sources. Nuisance acceptability levels are then definable according to the sensitivity degree of the locations. Factors related to vibrations and visual perception of the landscape can further contribute to control total sensorial annoyance in the land planning...|$|R
40|$|When {{treating}} municipal wastewater, {{the disposal}} of sludge {{is a problem of}} growing importance, representing up to 50 % of the current operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant. Although different disposal routes are possible, anaerobic digestion plays an important role for its abilities to further transform organic matter into biogas (60 - 70 vol% of methane, CH 4), as thereby it also reduces the amount of final sludge solids for disposal whilst destroying most of the pathogens present in the sludge and <b>limiting</b> <b>odour</b> problems associated with residual putrescible matter. Anaerobic digestion thus optimises WWTP costs, its environmental footprint and is considered a major and essential part of a modern WWTP. The potential of using the biogas as energy source has long been widely recognised and current techniques are being developed to upgrade quality and to enhance energy use. The present paper extensively reviews the principles of anaerobic digestion, the process parameters and their interaction, the design methods, the biogas utilisation, the possible problems and potential pro-active cures, and the recent developments to reduce the impact of the problems. After having reviewed the basic principles and techniques of the anaerobic digestion process, modelling concepts will be assessed to delineate the dominant parameters. Hydrolysis is recognised as rate-limiting step in the complex digestion process. The microbiology of anaerobic digestion is complex and delicate, involving several bacterial groups, each of them having their own optimum working conditions. As will be shown, these groups are sensitive to and possibly inhibited by several process parameters such as pH, alkalinity, concentration of free ammonia, hydrogen, sodium, potassium, heavy metals, volatile fatty acids and others. To accelerate the digestion and enhance the production of biogas, various pre-treatments can be used to improve the rate-limiting hydrolysis. These treatments include mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological interventions to the feedstock. All pre-treatments result in a lysis or disintegration of sludge cells, thus releasing and solubilising intracellular material into the water phase and transforming refractory organic material into biodegradable species. Possible techniques to upgrade the biogas formed by removing CO 2, H 2 S and excess moisture will be summarised. Special attention will be paid to the problems associated with siloxanes (SX) possibly present in the sludge and biogas, together with the techniques to either reduce their concentration in sludge by preventive actions such as peroxidation, or eliminate the SX from the biogas by adsorption or other techniques. The reader will finally be guided to extensive publications concerning the operation, control, maintenance and troubleshooting of anaerobic digestion plants. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
