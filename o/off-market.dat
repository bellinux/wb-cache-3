Many investors and developers prefer <b>off-market</b> transactions {{for a variety of}} reasons, one of which is controlling the publicity of the availability of the property, which could create issues with other lease negotiations on other deals.

50|$|Truly dark {{liquidity}} can {{be collected}} <b>off-market</b> in dark pools using FIX and FAST protocol based APIs. Dark pools are generally {{very similar to}} standard markets with similar order types, pricing rules and prioritization rules. However, the liquidity is deliberately not advertised—there is no market depth feed. Such markets have no need of an iceberg-order type. In addition, they prefer not to print the trades to any public data feed, or if legally required to do so, will do so with as large a delay as legally possible—all to reduce the market impact of any trade. Dark pools are often formed from brokers' order books and other <b>off-market</b> liquidity. When comparing pools, careful checks should be made as to how liquidity numbers were calculated—some venues count {{both sides of the}} trade, or even count liquidity that was posted but not filled.|$|E

50|$|A {{marketing}} synergy {{refers to}} the use of information campaigns, studies, and scientific discovery or experimentation for research or development.

50|$|At {{one end of}} the {{spectrum}} lie the super introduced local property experts who can be an invaluable resource for a buyer who is set on <b>off-market</b> or pre-market properties as well as private deals. These professionals are often able to source <b>off-market</b> because they have close ties with estate agents (or, in the United States, real estate brokers), they know other local intermediaries who may flag exclusive confidential deals, such as lawyers, private bankers, investment managers or other professionals and they sometimes know personally the owners of the best luxury properties for sale in the area they cover.

50|$|In general, no law {{has been}} broken by Tweed in {{advancing}} his offers. Several shareholders who had accepted Tweed's offers annulled the contract due to technicalities in the <b>off-market</b> transfer process; however, the great proportion were relieved of their shares. Whenever a technicality has been identified, Tweed has amended his practices to stay {{one step ahead of}} the law, thus frustrating those that would like to shut him down. Tweed has mercilessly sued to enforce performance of agreements signed, often for minor amounts of less than $1000. These cases are usually settled in his favour and also enable the former shareholders to avoid the legal costs of mounting a defence.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Greece, the April 2010 {{notification}} contained revised fiscal data for 2006-2009, but with remaining reservations in these areas: statistical classification of public corporations, <b>off-market</b> swaps, social security funds, unaudited budget amounts and payables. These were addressed in the October 2010 EDP notification, a significant revision. However, residual uncertainties, notably for the year 2009, called for another visit, known as [...] "extended". Its outcome is the November 2010 EDP notification (outside the statutory schedule), which is published in a comprehensive report concluding that [...] "revised data for 2006-2009 are sufficiently reliable for EDP purposes". An accompanying information note was published around the same time.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} the Asian American Theater Company was housed in The Asian American Theater Center {{located near the}} corner of Arguello and Clement Streets in San Francisco’s ethnically diverse Richmond district.

50|$|Channel 28 briefly {{dropped its}} UPN {{affiliation}} {{in the spring}} of 1998 and became an independent station, as did most of the UPN-affiliated stations that Sinclair either owned or controlled, due to a dispute between UPN and Sinclair. During the dispute, UPN programming was available in the Raleigh market via <b>off-market</b> stations, such as WUPN (Greensboro) and WILM-LD (Wilmington) on cable providers in the Raleigh, Durham, and Fayetteville areas and via Dish Network satellite services. However, UPN and Sinclair patched up their dispute, and UPN programming returned to WRDC in the summer. Sinclair purchased WRDC outright in 2001; this was possible because WNCN had by this time passed WRDC as the fourth-rated station in the Triangle. The FCC's duopoly rules prohibit one company to own two of the four highest-rated stations by total viewership in a single market.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{full-time}} {{agents have}} knowledge of pocket listings {{in their own}} office or in other offices of their own company. While many MLS systems may try to limit this type of listing by requiring execution of a written notice relative to the benefits of MLS publicity, they may encourage members to refrain from taking pocket listings. There are some companies which list property as pocket listings {{for a short time}} before entering it into their MLS. With the written agreement of the seller, this would allow the company to try to obtain both the listing side and the [...] "selling" [...] side of the commission, an industry term known as [...] "both sides of the transaction". The L.A. Loft Blog reports that up to 45% of transactions in Downtown Los Angeles since 2011 have been <b>off-market,</b> private listings such as pocket listings.|$|E
50|$|Tweed set up four companies: National Exchange Pty Ltd, National Share Purchasing Corporation Pty Ltd (NSPC), Direct Share Purchasing Corporation Pty Ltd (DSPC) and Australian Share Purchasing Corporation (ASPC). By obtaining {{contact details}} through the share {{register}} of target companies, {{he has made}} several offers to purchase shares in those companies. The offers are often far below the market prices that could be realised on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). For instance, when AMP was trading at around $17, Tweed offered A$13.00 for the shares which subsequently fell to $5. Tweed's offers would often be {{in the form of}} a cover letter with large font detailing his offer and with an enclosed <b>off-market</b> transfer form that was pre-filled with the details of the target shareholder. A large number of shareholders, often elderly people who had never owned shares before, would take up the offer despite the market price clearly available in newspapers such as The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Financial Review.|$|E
