60|$|The ancient world, {{because of}} its {{metallurgical}} inferiority, could not use steam. The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available. The early engines seem to the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do. As late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently (1864) the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process,</b> in which steel and every sort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard of. To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan. Nothing in the previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved. The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods. Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and {{a new way of}} building with steel upon a gigantic scale. Men realized too late that they had planned their railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.|$|E
25|$|Cornwall Iron Furnace became {{obsolete}} by the 1880s. The Bessemer and <b>open-hearth</b> <b>processes</b> {{of creating}} steel, {{the replacement of}} charcoal with coke and anthracite coal, the discovery of iron deposits at the Iron Range in Minnesota near Lake Superior, and the building of modern factories in Pittsburgh, Steelton and Bethlehem brought {{about the end of}} iron production in Cornwall. Cornwall Furnace no longer earned a profit in its last ten years of operation and the last owner, Robert Habersham Coleman, had it shut down on February 11, 1883. In 1932, the furnace and ancillary buildings were deeded by Margaret Coleman Buckingham and have since been restored and open to the public.|$|R

5000|$|After 1890 the Bessemer {{process was}} {{gradually}} supplanted by open-hearth steelmaking {{and by the}} middle of the 20th century was no longer in use. [...] The <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> originated in the 1860s in Germany and France. The usual <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> used pig iron, ore, and scrap, and became known as the Siemens-Martin process. Its process allowed closer control over the composition of the steel; also, a substantial quantity of scrap could be included in the charge. The crucible process remained important for making high-quality alloy steel into the 20th century. By 1900 the electric arc furnace was adapted to steelmaking and by the 1920s, the falling cost of electricity allowed it to largely supplant the crucible process for specialty steels.|$|E
50|$|Navigable terrain, waterways, and ports spurred an {{unprecedented}} construction of transportation infrastructure throughout the region. The region {{is a global}} leader in advanced manufacturing and research and development, with significant innovations in both production processes and business organization. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil set precedents for centralized pricing, uniform distribution, and controlled product standards through Standard Oil, which started as a consolidated refinery in Cleveland. Cyrus McCormick's Reaper and other manufacturers of agricultural machinery consolidated into International Harvester in Chicago. Andrew Carnegie's steel production integrated large-scale <b>open-hearth</b> and Bessemer <b>processes</b> into the world's most efficient and profitable mills. The largest, most comprehensive monopoly in the world, United States Steel, consolidated steel production throughout the region. Many of the world's largest employers began in the Great Lakes region.|$|R

50|$|After {{the deaths}} of William and Charles Darby in 1882 and 1884 respectively, the {{business}} was incorporated as Brymbo Steel Co. Ltd. Robertson encouraged John Henry Darby, the son of William, and Peter Williams (father of the MP Christmas Price Williams, who was born at Brymbo) to trial steelmaking using the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process,</b> and by January 1885 Brymbo had produced its first steel in a plant {{which was the first}} of its kind in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|In 1898 the Ensley Land Company was reorganized {{and active}} {{industrial}} development resumed, including {{the construction of}} hundreds of small workers' cottages. It was here that TCI pioneered the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> of making steel in the Birmingham District. By 1906 two more blast furnaces were completed and a record 400,000 tons of steel were produced in a single year. Schools, churches, public buildings and stores were rapidly constructed {{to keep pace with}} the scores of new mills and plants opening up.|$|E
50|$|Wellman {{began his}} career working at the Nashua Iron Company. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to build a regenerative gas furnace for the company. Wellman did this, impressing Carl Wilhelm Siemens, who immediately hired him to establish the first crucible-steel furnace in America. Wellman went on to improve upon the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> of steel rail production, which in turn had improved upon the Bessemer process. In 1869, Wellman built the first commercially successful open-hearth furnace in America at the Bay State Iron Works in South Boston.|$|E
50|$|Steel was {{introduced}} to the construction industry {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the Bessemer process was developed in England in 1856, and the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of terra-cotta, tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed insulation. Ferro concrete, also called reinforced concrete, was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.|$|E
50|$|In 1860 {{partners}} in B. Hick and Son, John Hick and William Hargreaves joined Thomas Lever Rushton's brother-in-law Henry Sharp as {{partners in}} Sharp and Eckersley, formerly Rushton and Eckersley before Rushton's retirement {{from the firm}} in 1859. The three partners Sharp, Hick and Hargreaves formed the Bolton Iron & Steel Company; situated next door to Rothwell's Union Foundry (now Bolton bus station) the company supplied basic metals required by the major manufacturers in the area. Bessemer steel making began about 1860 - four six-ton Bessemer converters were installed during the 1860s, and experiments with the Sieman's <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process</b> began in 1867. Rolling, casting and forging equipment was installed, its products included steel deck beams for ships and sheet metal for shovels, during 1865 Bolton Iron & Steel cast the largest anvil block made in England, weighing 210 tons. By 1869 the company was making open hearth steel and manufacturing steam hammers {{to the design of}} Francis Webb. Hick's nephew became a shareholder following incorporation on 9 June 1876.|$|E
50|$|Midvale {{began with}} the {{crucible}} process, but two years after its founding began using the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>process,</b> which would in time replace the crucibles. The company's early years were rocky. Eventually, a principal investor, the quiet but immensely influential American engineer and businessman William Sellers, forced out Butcher, whose adherence {{to the idea of}} steelmaking as an obscure art of secret recipes did not serve him well when his recipes did not turn out right and he was unable to analyze why. With Butcher gone, Sellers renamed his erstwhile-namesake steel works the Midvale Steel Works. Kanigel states that the name reflected the fact that Midvale was roughly equidistant from the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers; however, if accurate, this etymology was fanciful, because a look at a map of Philadelphia shows that the plant, at Wissahickon and Roberts Avenues, was actually much closer to the Schuylkill. Perhaps the emphasis was that it was not directly on either river (as might usually be expected of a steelworks), but between them. In 1872, Sellers brought in a Yale-trained chemist with a talent for organization named Charles Augustus Brinley, who used applied science to straighten out the steelmaking formulas and processes, along the way analyzing and salvaging the scrap that had accumulated during Butcher's tenure.|$|E
