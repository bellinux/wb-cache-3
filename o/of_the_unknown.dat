Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown</b> to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E

5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin.

The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial {{resistance}} against French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others involved in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost their lives on the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown</b> Soldier.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 a {{national}} Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial {{was installed in}} Westminster Abbey close to the tomb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown</b> Warrior.

As such it was a significant honour for the VC to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown</b> Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown</b> Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E

5|$|Over the Garden Wall is an American {{animated}} television miniseries {{created by}} Patrick McHale for Cartoon Network. The series centers on two half-brothers who travel across a strange forest {{in order to}} find their way home, encountering odd and wonderful things on their journey. The show is based on McHale's animated short film Tome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown,</b> which was produced as part of Cartoon Network Studios' shorts development program. The show features Elijah Wood and Collin Dean as the protagonists Wirt and Greg, and Melanie Lynskey as a bluebird named Beatrice. Over the Garden Wall was broadcast throughout the week of November 3, 2014 to November 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the live shows, 15,488,019 votes were cast.

Proceeds were split between production company Syco, co-producer FremantleMedia, broadcaster ITV and phone vote operator Harvest Media. Advertising slots during the final were sold for up to £250,000, which expected to bring in a further £25million in advertising revenues, with the number of commercial breaks increased from five to six.|$|E
