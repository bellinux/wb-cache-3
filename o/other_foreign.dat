5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet.

5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First Opium War, the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties.

Following China's concession to the British Empire, <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of Hercules from Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. When violence broke out following the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30August 1999, C-130H sorties were flown into the then-Indonesian province from 6 to 14September to evacuate United Nations personnel {{as well as}} <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> citizens and East Timorese refugees. Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18September. On 19September a C-130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) team near the East Timorese capital of Dili ahead of {{the arrival of the}} main INTERFET force the next day. From 20September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No.86 Wing DetachmentB) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.|$|E

5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for Venice {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} did not {{adhere to}} traditional architectural practices when constructing houses, but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses {{are no longer}} standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with thatched roofs, resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century. Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> and indigenous groups lived {{according to their own}} cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation. As racial segregation eased {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the public display of Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.|$|E

Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals.

5|$|In Ancient Roman times, a new Roman mythology {{was born}} through syncretization of {{numerous}} Greek and <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> gods. This occurred because the Romans had little mythology of their own, and inheritance of the Greek mythological tradition caused the major Roman gods to adopt characteristics of their Greek equivalents. The gods Zeus and Jupiter are {{an example of}} this mythological overlap. In addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions, the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations. For instance, the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian's successful campaigns in Syria. The Asiatic divinities Mithras (that is to say, the Sun) and Ba'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus, but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments. The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice. The worship of Sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In April 1887, Kalākaua sent a {{delegation}} {{to attend the}} Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in London. It included his wife Queen Kapiʻolani, the Princess Liliʻuokalani and her husband, as well as Court Chamberlain Colonel Curtis P. Iaukea acting as the official envoy of the King. The party landed in San Francisco and traveled across the United States visiting Washington, D.C., Boston and New York City where they boarded a ship for England. While in the American capital, they were received by President Grover Cleveland and his wife. In London, Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani received an official audience with Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. Queen Victoria greeted both Hawaiian royals with affection, and recalled Kalākaua's visit in 1881. They attended the special Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey and were seated with <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> royal guests, and {{with members of the}} Royal Household. Shortly after the Jubilee celebrations, they learned of the Bayonet Constitution that Kalākaua had been forced to sign under the threat of death. They canceled their tour of Europe and returned to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, a C-130H {{became the}} first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian and <b>other</b> <b>foreign</b> embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John PaulII's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.|$|E
