5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E

25|$|Above the UBS, {{there is}} the upper shield cover; its top surface is {{the floor of the}} central hall.

25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood {{with a pile of}} tinder between them, and small kindling laid <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E
500|$|Actual {{spawning}} {{occurs when}} a collection of males gather around gravid females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into and slithering <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs. [...] Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column. [...] The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins. [...] It takes {{only a few days}} for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another ten days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry. Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent {{on the size of the}} female. [...] A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn. [...] The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.|$|E

500|$|When Connor {{realized}} that the Birmingham jail was full, on May 3 he changed police tactics to keep protesters out of the downtown business area. Another thousand students gathered at the church and left to walk across Kelly Ingram Park while chanting, [...] "We're going to walk, walk, walk. Freedom... freedom... freedom." [...] As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, [...] "or you'll get wet". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set {{at a level that}} would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> cars by the force of the water. When the students crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, [...] "Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{attribute}} of the penny-farthing {{is that the}} rider sits high and nearly over the front axle. [...] When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. [...] Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard. Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 1868, an {{earthquake}} with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.9 on the Richter scale rocked the southeast coast of Hawaii. This {{was the most}} destructive earthquake in the recorded history of Hawaii. It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa, [...] north of Pahala, killing 31 people. [...] A tsunami claimed 46 more lives. The villages of Punalu'u, NÄ«nole, Kawaa, Honuapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged. The tsunami reportedly rolled <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the coconut trees up to [...] high, and it reached inland a distance of {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 meters) in some places.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the top of}} Great Rigg {{the main}} ridge ploughs on due south, {{descending}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> Heron Pike and Nab Scar and carrying the ever popular Fairfield horseshoe walk. A second shorter ridge descends steadily to the south west over gradually roughening ground, until after {{three quarters of a}} mile a rock outcrop is thrust up. This is Arthur's Chair and the ridge upon which it stands is Stone Arthur. Prominence is negligible, and other than the low outcrop itself, the [...] "summit" [...] is merely {{the point at which the}} gradient steepens markedly.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} the crash, a group of Anglo-American youths rode their horses <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the settlers' {{subterranean}} homes, damaging them. [...] Thinking that the pranks were but youthful mischief, the commune members simply repaired their dwellings and made no complaint. [...] But shortly thereafter, they returned from work in the cotton fields to discover two residences destroyed by fire. [...] Tijerina and two other men went to file a report with Sheriff Lawrence White. [...] But when White found out the direction from which the horse tracks came, he refused to investigate. [...] Don Pelkam, an FBI agent stationed in Casa Grande who had investigated the crash, also refused to investigate, claiming that the arson had occurred outside his jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{the majority}} of the people who climb Dove Crag do so from Ambleside as part of the Fairfield horseshoe walk. However, the ascent from Patterdale gives the walker the opportunity to explore the relatively unknown valley of Dovedale and the beck which flows down it and to study the crags of the fell. It is believed that the upper part of Dovedale was once the crater of a volcano. The ascent from Patterdale starts from the car park at Brothers Water and takes the path to Hartsop Hall. Here the rising path up Dovedale is taken. As the crags are approached at the head of the valley, there is a choice of going to the right or left of them to reach the summit. The fell can also be approached from Ambleside along its long southern ridge passing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> Low Pike and High Pike. The summit is a small rock platform with a cairn.|$|E
