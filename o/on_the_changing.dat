5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Several {{important}} caveats exist. Since {{the human}} mind struggles to think in greater than three dimensions, 3D topologies can mislead when discussing highly multi-dimensional fitness landscapes. In particular {{it is not clear}} whether peaks in natural biological fitness landscapes are ever truly separated by fitness valleys in such multidimensional landscapes, or whether they are connected by vastly long neutral ridges. Additionally, the fitness landscape is not static in time but dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> environment and evolution of other genes. It is hence more of a seascape, further affecting how separated adaptive peaks can actually be. Finally, since it is common to use function as a proxy for fitness when discussing enzymes, any promiscuous activities exist as overlapping landscapes that together will determine the ultimate fitness of the organism.|$|E

25|$|Trip Brennan of The Intercept {{reviewed}} both Why We Want You to be Rich and Midas Touch, and {{was critical}} of both books. Brennan criticized Midas Touch for its support of multi-level marketing, a practice he described as a pyramid scheme in disguise. He wrote negatively of the book's discounting of investment in mutual funds. BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail. BuzzFeed News was critical Trump had shifted his perspective from the book, where he had previously written U.S. industrial jobs would never return and individuals needed to learn to cope with new skills in the Information Age. Business Insider similarly compared the work with Trump's 2016 campaign message, noting the book ended with a passage embracing immigrants whereas the Trump campaign {{was critical of}} illegal immigration from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Since the Chinese state {{continues}} to exert {{a considerable amount}} of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has {{come as a surprise to}} many observers. Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.|$|E

500|$|The {{landscape}} {{paintings of}} Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (18191891) influenced both Boudin and Monet {{and contributed to}} the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E
500|$|In mid-November 1943, Major Lukačević was {{the chief}} of the Chetnik {{detachments}} based near Stari Ras, near Novi Pazar in the Sandžak. On 13 November, his representative concluded a formal collaboration agreement (...) with the representative of the German Military Commander in southeast Europe, General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Hans Felber.

Under the agreement, a special German liaison officer was assigned to Lukačević to advise on tactics, ensure cooperation, and facilitate arms and ammunition supply.

There was a linear relationship between the corrected pressure term (pr/zmix) and the cumulative production term (Gpt-GinjCO 2). The amount of CO 2 storage can be analysed directly from the pr/zmix plot. The total volume of CO 2 storage is larger than that of natural gas production from a depleted gas reservoir...|$|R
