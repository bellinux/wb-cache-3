2500|$|The {{first two}} {{representative}} games were styled as the [...] "Honourable Ivo Bligh's Team versus Mr Murdoch's XI". The Aussies took £200 per player {{in each of}} these games as record-breaking crowds poured into the M.C.G., and the New Year's Day attendance was 23,000. The highlight of the first Test was an innings of 85 in 135 minutes from George Bonnor as Australia made 291 in its first innings. Rain came down during the England innings, making the pitch more difficult than it had been. England, struggling to cope with this, made only 177 and was forced to follow on 114 runs behind. Mr Murdoch's XI won easily by 9 wickets, and the Colonial press saw the victory as confirmation of Australia's superiority. Bligh, however, later commented, [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>still</b> cherished the hope that our turn was yet to come." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{has become}} of the boat?" [...] {{suddenly}} cried the mate. [...] "I have been so much occupied as to have forgotten the boat. In that boat we might all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>still</b> reach Key West. I see nothing of the boat!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... --is {{the divinity}} of the extract assured {{to us by}} its being made at leisure, and in a {{reclining}} attitude--as compared with the meditations of otherwise active men, in an erect one?

6000|$|Carnforth laughed, but {{the girl}} had seen him start. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I don't mind admitting that if the one in {{question}} went north some day and didn't come back again, {{it would be a}} relief to one or two <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Still,</b> I'm 'most afraid that's too fortunate a thing to happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is possible, Sheila; we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> stand <b>still,</b> you know. One rips open a lid {{sometimes}} and the wax face rots before one's eyes. Take back your blue envelope; {{and thank you}} for thinking of me. It's always the woman of the house that has the head.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is cruel," [...] said he, [...] "and unchristian, too. The worst <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are <b>still</b> bidden to hope. What have I {{done that}} you should pass on me so severe a sentence?" [...] And then he paused a moment, during which the widow walked {{steadily}} on with measured steps, saying nothing further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seeing {{that all}} three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are <b>still</b> in health, {{as if there is}} {{anything}} in the promises of Murgh we should remain, is it not time, master," [...] asked Grey Dick, [...] "that we left this accursed Venice? Now that Sir Geoffrey is gone, there is naught to keep us here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} things are bad {{up in the}} North," [...] he said. [...] "You mustn't think that we people who are {{responsible}} for the laws of the country ignore this, Mr. Fardell.

60|$|Thus, {{when the}} anxiety was over, {{and he was}} a strong boy, full of health and activity, his will was entirely unrestrained, he had no notion of minding any <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>still</b> less of learning.

He had set off at six that morning, and we {{at three in the}} afternoon.

60|$|A few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>still</b> {{went through}} the {{affectation}} of attempting to dry our damp clothes by the stove, and sizzling our wet boots against it; but as the same individuals calmly permitted the rain to drive in upon them {{through the open window}} without moving, and seemed to take infinite delight in the amount of steam they generated, even that pretense dropped. Crotalus himself, with his tail in a muddy ditch, and the sun striking cold fire from his slit eyes as he basked his head on a warm stone beside it, could not have typified us better.|$|E

Mrs. Tenbruggen passed me, not looking so pleasantly as usual, joined the children, and walked with two of them, hand in hand, a pattern of maternal amiability. I dropped back a little, and gave Eunice an opportunity of joining me; having purposely left her to form her own opinion, without any adverse influence exercised on my part.|$|E
