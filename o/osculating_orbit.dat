500|$|Single-apparition or non-periodic comets {{are similar}} to long-period comets because they also have {{parabolic}} or slightly hyperbolic trajectories when near perihelion in the inner Solar System. However, gravitational perturbations from giant planets cause their orbits to change. Single-apparition comets have a hyperbolic or parabolic <b>osculating</b> <b>orbit</b> which allows them to permanently exit the Solar System after a single pass of the Sun. The Sun's Hill sphere has an unstable maximum boundary of 230,000 AU (...)

500|$|Long-period comets have highly {{eccentric}} orbits and periods {{ranging from}} 200 years {{to thousands of}} years. An eccentricity greater than 1 when near perihelion {{does not necessarily mean}} that a comet will leave the Solar System. For example, Comet McNaught had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage epoch in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600-year orbit because the eccentricity drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the <b>osculating</b> <b>orbit</b> is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the Solar System. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having [...] "periods". The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as Comet West and C/1999 F1 can have aphelion distances of nearly 70,000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.|$|E

40|$|Context. The {{dynamical}} {{evolution of}} near-parabolic comets strongly {{depends on the}} starting values of the orbital elements derived from the positional observations. In addition, when drawing conclusions {{about the origin of}} these objects, it is crucial to control the uncertainties of orbital elements at each stage of the dynamical evolution. Aims. I apply a completely homogeneous approach to determine the cometary orbits and their uncertainties. The resulting catalogue is suitable for the investigation of the origin and future of near-parabolic comets. Methods. First, <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits</b> were determined on the basis of positional data. Second, the dynamical calculations were performed backwards and forwards up to 250 au from the Sun to derive original and future barycentric orbits for each comet. In the present investigation of dynamical evolution, the numerical calculations for a given object start from the swarm of virtual comets constructed using the previously determined <b>osculating</b> (nominal) <b>orbit.</b> In this way, the uncertainties of orbital elements were derived at the end of numerical calculations. Results. Homogeneous sets of orbital elements for osculating, original and future orbits are given. The catalogue of 119 cometary orbits constitutes about 70 per cent of all the first class so-called Oort spike comets discovered during the period of 1801 – 2010 and about 90 per cent of those discovered in 1951 - 2010, for which observations were completed at the end of 2013. Non-gravitational (NG) orbits are derived for 45 comets, including asymmetric NG solution for six of them.

40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{computing}} coplanar, minimum-fuel, power-limited transfers are developed, based on approximate solutions {{obtained by the}} averaging method. In the first method, the average solution provides estimates of the initial adjoint variables; in the second, it provides approximations of the optimal controls in feedback form. Both trajectory variables and orbit elements are used in developing these methods. Canonical transformations are derived to convert between these sets of coordinates. The accuracy of the methods for computing coplanar, minimum-fuel, power-limited transfers is assessed {{for a variety of}} initial and final orbits. Some initial steps are taken toward the characterization of coplanar, minimum-fuel, power-limited transfers {{for a wide range of}} thrust to weight ratios. Circle to ellipse and ellipse to ellipse transfers are considered. Details of the trajectories and thrust profiles for a few illustrative cases are presented. These trajectories and thrust profiles are compared to analytical results obtained using the averaging method and to the analytic solution for infinitesimal transfer. The secular behavior of minimum-fuel transfer is predicted by the averaging results. The shape and orientation of the <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits</b> are predicted quantitatively, while the size is predicted qualitatively.

40|$|Past {{and future}} {{dynamical}} evolution of all 64 long period comets having 1 /aori 3. 0 au and discovered after 1970 is studied. For {{all of them}} we obtained a new, homogeneous set of <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits,</b> including 15 orbits with detected non-gravitational parameters. The non-gravitational effects for eleven of these 15 comets have been determined for the first time. These were propagated numerically back and forth up to the 250 au heliocentric distance, constituting sets of original and future orbits together with their uncertainties. Next we followed the dynamical evolution under the Galactic tides for one orbital revolution {{to the past and}} future, obtaining orbital elements at previous/next perihelion passages. We obtained a clear dependence of the last revolution change in perihelion distance with respect to the 1 /aori, what confirmed theoretical expectations. We show that about 50 per cent of all investigated comets have their previous perihelion distance below the 15 au limit. This resulted in classifying 31 comets as dynamically new, 26 as dynamically old and 7 having unclear status. We also present several examples of cometary motion through the Jupiter-Saturn barrier, some of them with the previous perihelion distance smaller than the observed one. New interpretations of the long period comets source pathways are also discussed in the light of suggestions of Kaib & Quinn (2009). Comment: 19 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

40|$|Extreme mass-ratio inspirals, {{in which}} solar-mass compact bodies spiral into supermassive black holes, are an {{important}} potential source for gravitational wave detectors. Because of the extreme mass-ratio, one can model these systems using perturbation theory. However, in order to relate {{the motion of the}} small body to the emitted waveform, one requires a model that is accurate on extremely long timescales. Additionally, in order to avoid intractable divergences, one requires a model that treats the small body as asymptotically small rather than exactly pointlike. Both of these difficulties can be resolved by using techniques of singular perturbation theory. I begin this dissertation with an analysis of singular perturbation theory on manifolds, including the common techniques of matched asymptotic expansions and two-timescale expansions. I then formulate a systematic asymptotic expansion in which the metric perturbation due to the body is expanded while a representative worldline is held fixed, and I contrast it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the worldline must be expanded. This results in an approximation that is potentially uniformly accurate on long timescales. The equation of motion for the body's fixed worldline is determined by performing a local-in-space expansion in the neighbourhood of the body. Using this local expansion as boundary data, I construct a global solution to the perturbative Einste in equation. To concretely characterize orbits, I next devise a relativistic generalization of the Newtonian method of <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits.</b> Making use of this method and two-timescale expansions, I examine the utility of adiabatic approximations that can forgo an explicit calculation of the force...|$|R

We also show with equal rigor that the radiation from nearly-Newtonian systems obeys the far-field quadrupole formula (Landau-Lifshitz formula). There are no divergent terms in these approximations at any order, although logarithmic terms in the expansion parameter do appear at high order.

40|$|Dynamics of a {{complete}} sample of 22 small perihelion distance near-parabolic comets discovered in the years 2006 - 2010 is studied. First, <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits</b> are obtained after a careful positional data inspection and processing, including where appropriate, the method of data partitioning for determination of pre- and post-perihelion orbit for tracking then its dynamical evolution. The nongravitational acceleration in the motion is detected for 50 per cent of investigated comets, {{in a few cases}} for the first time. Different sets of nongravitational parameters are determined from pre- and post-perihelion data for some of them. The influence of the positional data structure on the possibility of the detection of nongravitational effects and the overall precision of orbit determination is widely discussed. Secondly, both original and future orbits were derived by means of numerical integration of swarms of virtual comets obtained using a Monte Carlo cloning method. This method allows to follow the uncertainties of orbital elements at each step of dynamical evolution. The complete statistics of original and future orbits that includes significantly different uncertainties of 1 /a-values is presented, also in the light of our results obtained earlier. Basing on 108 comets examined by us so far, we conclude that only one of them, C/ 2007 W 1 Boattini, seems to be a serious candidate for an interstellar comet. We also found that 53 per cent of 108 near-parabolic comets escaping in the future from the Solar system, and the number of comets leaving the Solar system as so called Oort spike comets is 14 per cent.

This paper {{investigates the}} long-period and secular {{dynamics}} of a satellite about an oblate primary while relieving {{the assumption that}} the perturbed orbit is instantaneously parameterized by <b>osculating</b> Keplerian <b>orbits.</b> The inherent freedom obtained by transforming the orbital dynamics from the Cartesian inertial space to the orbital elements space, termed gauge freedom, is utilized to nullify four planetary equations. It is shown that there exists an orbit representation in which the mean non-osculating perigee is stable under the oblateness perturbation and that nodal precession, apsidal rotation and epoch drift may be simulta-neously nullified on the expense of secular eccentricity and inclination variations. These observations considerably expand the standard description of J 2 -perturbed motion using mean osculating orbital elements, which predicts secular variation nullification of semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination only...|$|R
40|$|We present {{two methods}} for {{integrating}} forced geodesic equations in the Kerr spacetime, which can accommodate arbitrary forces. As a test case, we compute inspirals under a simple drag force, mimicking {{the presence of}} gas. We verify that both methods give the same results for this simple force. We find that drag generally causes eccentricity to increase throughout the inspiral. This is a relativistic effect qualitatively opposite to what is seen in gravitational-radiation-driven inspirals, and similar to what is observed in hydrodynamic simulations of gaseous binaries. We provide an analytic explanation by deriving the leading order relativistic correction to the Newtonian dynamics. If observed, an increasing eccentricity would provide clear evidence that the inspiral was occurring in a non-vacuum environment. Our two methods are especially useful for evolving orbits in the adiabatic regime. Both use the method of <b>osculating</b> <b>orbits,</b> in which each point on the orbit {{is characterized by the}} parameters of the geodesic with the same instantaneous position and velocity. Both methods describe the orbit in terms of the geodesic energy, axial angular momentum, Carter constant, azimuthal phase, and two angular variables that increase monotonically and are relativistic generalizations of the eccentric anomaly. The two methods differ in their treatment of the orbital phases and the representation of the force. In one method the geodesic phase and phase constant are evolved together as a single orbital phase parameter, and the force is expressed in terms of its components on the Kinnersley orthonormal tetrad. In the second method, the phase constants of the geodesic motion are evolved separately and the force is expressed in terms of its Boyer-Lindquist components. This second approach is a generalization of earlier work by Pound and Poisson for planar forces in a Schwarzschild background. Comment: 28 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev.
