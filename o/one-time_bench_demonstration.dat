60|$|It {{was pointed}} out by Charles Dickens in Little Dorrit, which remains the most {{accurate}} and penetrating study of the genteel littleness of our class governments in the English language, that whenever an abuse becomes oppressive enough to persuade our party parliamentarians that something must be done, they immediately set to work to face the situation and discover How Not To Do It. Since Dickens's day the exposures effected by the Socialists have so shattered the self-satisfaction of modern commercial civilization {{that it is no}} longer difficult to convince our governments that something must be done, even to the extent of attempts at a reconstruction of civilization on a thoroughly uncommercial basis. Consequently, {{the first part of the}} process described by Dickens: that in which the reformers were snubbed by front <b>bench</b> <b>demonstrations</b> that the administrative departments were consuming miles of red tape in the correctest forms of activity, and that everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds, is out of fashion; and we are in that other phase, familiarized by the history of the French Revolution, in which the primary assumption is that the country is in danger, and that the first duty of all parties, politicians, and governments is to save it. But as the effect of this is to give governments a great many more things to do, it also gives a powerful stimulus to the art of How Not To Do Them: that is to say, the art of contriving methods of reform which will leave matters exactly as they are.|$|R
40|$|The CESL Copper Process was {{developed}} as a hydrometallurgical alternative to smelting and refining for copper sulphide concentrates. As the majority of such concentrates contain appreciable gold and silver values, effective recovery of these metals {{is essential to the}} economics of this technology. Unfortunately, conventional cyanide processing cannot be used on the residue from the copper process, due to its unusual characteristics when compared with naturally occurring gold and silver ores. An abundance of elemental sulphur, as well as the presence of cyanide soluble copper, leads to the formation of both thiocyanate and copper cyanide which is detrimental to process economics due to excessive cyanide consumption. This, however, can be reduced to acceptable levels by process innovations such as pressure cyanidation and cyanide recovery.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine if}} the neoclassical grisaille paintings by K. A. Senff in the rotunda of the Old Anatomical Theatre still existed and to what extent. At the same time, a study of the historical furniture was also conducted. As a result it can be confirmed that the paintings on the walls or ceilings have not survived and the assumption that they were covered with lime plaster {{at some point in time}} has been disproved. The greater part of the room is covered with secondary plaster, which is confirmed by the polychromic plaster fragment that was finished earlier and found in the upper part of the wall, partially covered by the current coved ceiling. The previous research also assumed that the current plaster coat was secondary. And the fact that the current ceiling with the mirrored vault is secondary was also confirmed. Based on the original plaster fragment that was found, it can be assumed that the original finishing did not include the niches in the upper part of the walls, where it has been assumed that the paintings were located. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to ascertain where the paintings were located and how they were executed. Whether the rotunda’s interior was initially finished in a dark, almost black, shade, or was this true only of the upper part of the room; how the paintings in grey tones related to this and how extensive they were unfortunately remain a secret hidden in the obscurity of history. Questions are also raised by the fact that Krause’s notes are the only primary sources to provide information about the paintings. One would expect to find other indications of such large-scale and exceptional work (Senff is not known to have created any other monumental paintings) in the archival materials (for instance, in Senff’s own materials). It is still unclear why the initial plaster coat was totally removed and a new coat applied, especially if we consider that it was covered with paintings. Although these large-scale renovations can be associated with the period between 1856 and 1860 (architect K. Rathaus), when the rotunda’s interior was rebuilt and the entire anatomical theatre was expanded, questions are raised by the fact that the current secondary plaster coat has an unexpectedly small number of finishing coats for such long period of time. Since, the only surviving plaster fragment that presumably dates back to the Krause era is an extremely valuable historical document and forms the basis for future research, it should be exhibited in the room when the interior renovation is completed. As a result of the research conducted on the finishing coats of the historical furniture, it turned out that the oldest piece of furniture in the current interior is probably the rostrum. However whether or not it dates back to the time when the rotunda was built is still an open question. In the future, its original polychromy should be revealed and exhibited when the planned interior finishing is completed. Based on the current research, the <b>benches,</b> <b>demonstration</b> table and central section of the wall cabinet can be associated with the reconstruction of the anatomical theatre in the second half of the 1850 s. The benches and rostrum have been altered thereafter as needed.

A portfolio of technologies now exists to meet the world’s energy needs over the next 50 years and limit atmospheric CO 2 to a trajectory that avoids a doubling of the preindustrial concentration. Every element in this portfolio has passed beyond the laboratory <b>bench</b> and <b>demonstration</b> project; many are already implemented somewhere at full industrial scale. Although no element is a credible candidate for doing the entire job (or even half the job) by itself, the portfolio {{as a whole is}} large enough that not every element has to be used. The debate in the current literature about stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 at less than a doubling of the preindustrial concentration has led to needless confusion about current options for mitigation.

On the other side, a recent review in Science asserts that the IPCC claim demonstrates “misperceptions of technological readiness ” and calls for “revolutionary changes ” in mitigation technology, such as fusion, space-based solar electricity, and artificial photosynthesis (2). We agree that fundamental research is vital to develop the revolutionary mitigation strategies needed {{in the second half of}} this century and beyond.

30|$|Renewables are 46 % in the Brazilian energy matrix, {{while the}} world {{scenario}} differs from this context to use only 13 % of these resources. The biomass conversion using bioprocess has great potential to be applied in Brazil due to its large agroindustry which can produce a variety of feedstocks and byproducts that can be converted into biofuels and chemicals. The production of first-generation ethanol using sugarcane is a conventional technology in Brazil. This ethanol is the most competitive in the world, and Brazilian production reached 23.64 billion L in 2012 / 2013 season. Sugarcane bagasse generated from ethanol production and other biomasses obtained from forest and wood industries, crop residues, and grasses can be deconstructed to obtain sugars. These sugars may be bioconverted into second-generation ethanol and chemicals. Biodiesel is another biofuel that has been produced in Brazil. Although the commercial route to obtain biodiesel uses chemical conversion, there are researches investigating the biochemical route. Furthermore, some topics about microalgae use for biofuels are introduced. Therefore, this paper has the aim to present bioprocesses used in bioenergy production and the Brazilian overview on the conventional technology of first-generation sugarcane ethanol production. Moreover, <b>bench</b> studies and <b>demonstration</b> facilities {{that have been developed}} in the country regarding the advanced technologies are presented.|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has 49 {{high level}} waste (HLW) tanks {{that must be}} emptied, cleaned, and closed as {{required}} by the Federal Facilities Agreement. The current method of chemical cleaning uses several hundred thousand gallons per tank of 8 weight percent (wt%) oxalic acid to partially dissolve and suspend residual waste and corrosion products such that the waste can be pumped out of the tank. This adds a significant quantity of sodium oxalate to the tanks and, if multiple tanks are cleaned, renders the waste incompatible with the downstream processing. Tank space is also insufficient to store this stream given the large number of tanks to be cleaned. Therefore, a search for a new cleaning process was initiated utilizing the TRIZ literature search approach, and Chemical Oxidation Reduction Decontamination [...] Ultraviolet (CORD-UV), a mature technology currently used for decontamination and cleaning of commercial nuclear reactor primary cooling water loops, was identified. CORD-UV utilizes oxalic acid for sludge dissolution, but then decomposes the oxalic acid to carbon dioxide and water by UV treatment outside the system being treated. This allows reprecipitation and subsequent deposition of the sludge into a selected container without adding significant volume to that container, and without adding any new chemicals that would impact downstream treatment processes. <b>Bench</b> top and <b>demonstration</b> loop measurements on SRS tank sludge stimulant demonstrated the feasibility of applying CORD-UV for enhanced chemical cleaning of SRS HLW tanks...|$|R

During the building’s construction phase, we assisted {{the implementation of the}} energy concept and implemented an user-added monitoring system. Together with a virtual server infrastructure, different data bases, data processing algorithms, and interfaces, this system became the monitoring, control and interface system (MCIS) which transformed the building into a control research <b>demonstration</b> <b>bench.</b> Enabled by the extensive data available,wewere able to build and validate several simulation models for the building and for technical building equipment. These models were then used to set-up and run test scenarios for the development and improvement of control strategies for different parts of the energy concept. Monitoring data analyses and simulation studies enabled extensive system assessment and optimization via gathered knowledge and system insights. From an control point of view, the project revealed serious defects which led to an high energy consumption. The optimization’s result was a completely new control strategy, which we implemented in February 2014. An online monitoring and data visualization system publishes daily, weekly, monthly and yearly building reports, integrated into the new E. ON ERC homepage. Further, a promotional display in the building’s reception area informs about actual data points. The implemented energy concept is able to fulfill all energy demands. Thermal comfort within the new building is more than acceptable. The MCIS is in full operation and provides highly resolved monitoring data.

40|$|Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important alternative fuel that can help to achieve a number of national goals related to the reduction of fossil fuels and to the reduction in carbon dioxide emission. RNG can be produced from various carbonaceous materials such as biomass and organic wastes via a gasification process. The CE-CERT steam hydrogasification technology combines hydrogen with steam under pressurized conditions to convert a wet feedstock to a methane enriched syngas which can be upgraded to RNG and used for electric power and as an alternative transportation fuel. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a new process configuration of the steam hydrogasifier (SHR) using a water gas shift (WGS) reactor for the increased production of RNG in an economical manner. The producer gas from the SHR consists of H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2 and steam. The WGS process converts CO using the existing steam in the product stream from the SHR to H 2 and CO 2. This results in a self-sustainable internal source of hydrogen that can be generated internally and of sufficient quantity to be recycled back to the SHR. In this study, a mixture gas comparable to the composition of the producer gas from the SHR when using biosolids comingled with green waste was used as the input gas to the WGS reactor. A lab-scale WGS reaction system using a commercially available high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst was designed and built. The influence of temperature, space velocity, gas composition and particle size of catalysts on the conversion of CO using this system was investigated. It was found that at optimum conditions approximately 65 % of the CO can be converted using the HTS catalyst operating at 350 o C and atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen produced at this condition was sufficient to be recycled back to the SHR. Also, the overall change of CH 4 production was negligible. A mixture gas containing a wide range of H 2 S was carried out in the shift reactor using a Sour Gas Shift (SGS) catalyst to determine the influence of sulfur impurities. The conversion of the mixture gas with 350 ppm of sulfur was 55 % at the reaction temperature of 450 o C and a space velocity of 2500 h - 1, compared to 65 % with no sulfur. The percent conversion of CO could be improved if the composition of CO 2 was decreased. A larger scale HTS reactor was designed and built using the data from the experiments mentioned above. This was integrated into a <b>bench</b> scale Process <b>Demonstration</b> Unit (PDU) of the SHR with a capacity of 0. 1 TPD of dry feed. This process configuration demonstrated the production of high levels of RNG based for the CE-CERT technology using co-mingled biosolids and woody biomass as the feedstock. The reaction temperature of the SHR and WGS reactor were set at 750 o C and 350 o C, respectively, with an operating pressure at 150 psi. A carbon conversion of 42 % for the SHR and CO conversion of 60 % of WGS were achieved at those conditions. The final product gas contained over 85 % of CH 4 after gas cleanup in which 85 MJ/day or 32. 6 MJ/m 3 of energy was produced. This result clearly shows the viability of the process and provides critical design information to upscale to a pilot facility in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} technology platform for cleaning/conditioning the syngas from an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system at elevated temperatures (500 - 1, 000 F) and gasifier pressures to meet the tolerance limits for contaminants, including H{sub 2 }S, COS, NH{sub 3 }, HCl, Hg, and As. This technology development effort involved progressive development and testing of sorbent/catalytic materials and associated processes through laboratory, <b>bench,</b> pilot, and <b>demonstration</b> testing phases, coupled with a comprehensive systems analysis at various stages of development. The development of the regenerable RTI- 3 desulfurization sorbent - a highly attrition-resistant, supported ZnO-based material - was the key discovery in this project. RTI- 3 's high attrition resistance, coupled with its high reactivity, effectively allowed its application in a high-velocity transport reactor system. Production of the RTI- 3 sorbent was successfully scaled up to an 8, 000 -lb batch by Sued-Chemie. In October 2005, RTI obtained U. S Patent 6, 951, 635 to protect the RTI- 3 sorbent technology and won the 2004 R&D 100 Award for development of this material. The RTI- 3 sorbent formed the basis {{for the development of the}} High-Temperature Desulfurization System (HTDS), a dual-loop transport reactor system for removing the reduced sulfur species from syngas. An 83 -foot-tall, pilot HTDS unit was constructed and commissioned first at ChevronTexaco's gasification site and later at Eastman's gasification plant. At Eastman, the HTDS technology was successfully operated with coal-derived syngas for a total of 3, 017 hrs over a 12 -month period and consistently reduced the sulfur level to < 10 ppmv. The sorbent attrition rate averaged {approx} 31 lb/MM lb of circulation. To complement the HTDS technology, which extracts the sulfur from syngas as SO{sub 2 }, RTI developed the Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP). The DSRP, operating at high pressure and high temperature, uses a small slipstream of syngas to catalytically reduce the SO{sub 2 } produced in the warm syngas desulfurization process to elemental sulfur. To demonstrate this process at Eastman, RTI constructed and commissioned a skid-mounted pilot DSRP unit. During its 117 -h operation, the DSRP system achieved 90 % to 98 % removal of the inlet sulfur. The DSRP catalyst proved very robust, demonstrating consistent reaction rates in multiple experiments over a 3 -year period. Sorbent materials for removing trace NH{sub 3 }, Hg, and As impurities from syngas at high temperature and high pressure were developed and tested with real syngas. A Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } sorbent for removal of CO{sub 2 } from syngas at high temperature was also developed and tested. The Li{sub 4 }SiO{sub 4 } material demonstrates excellent CO{sub 2 } removal, but its regeneration was found to be technically challenging. Additionally, reverse-selective polymer membrane materials were investigated for the bulk removal of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S from syngas. These materials exhibited adequate separation at ambient conditions for these acid gases. Field testing of these membrane modules with real syngas demonstrated potential use for acid-gas separation from syngas. The HTDS/DSRP technologies are estimated to have a significant economic advantage over conventional gas cleanup technologies such as Selexol{trademark} and Rectisol. From a number of system studies, use of HTDS/DSRP is expected to give a 2 - 3 percentage point increase in the overall IGCC thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in capital cost. Thus, there is significant economic incentive for adaptation of these warm gas cleanup technologies due to significantly increased thermal efficiency and reduction in capital and operating costs. RTI and Eastman are currently in discussions with a number of companies to commercialize this technology...|$|R
40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{conducted}} a proof-of-principle test at the Fort Lewis Logistics Center {{to determine the}} feasibility of using the In Situ Redox Manipulation (ISRM) technology for remediating groundwater contaminated with dissolved trichloroethylene (TCE). ISRM creates a permeable treatment zone in the subsurface to remediate redox-sensitive contaminants in groundwater. The permeable treatment zone is formed by injecting a chemical reducing agent (sodium dithionite with pH buffers) into the aquifer through a well to reduce the naturally occurring ferric iron in the sediments to ferrous iron. Once the reducing agent is injected and given sufficient time to react with aquifer sediments, residual chemicals and reaction products are withdrawn from the aquifer through the same well used for the injection. Redox-sensitive contaminants such as TCE, moving through the treatment zone under natural groundwater flow conditions, are destroyed. TCE is degraded via reductive dechlorination within the ISRM treatment zone to benign degradation products (i. e., acetylene, ethylene). Prior to the proof-of-principle field test, the ISRM technology was successfully demonstrated in laboratory experiments for the reductive dechlorination of dissolved TCE using sediments from the Fort Lewis site. The Logistics Center {{was placed on the}} National Priorities List in December 1989 because of TCE contamination in groundwater beneath the site. A Federal Facilities Agreement between the Army, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Washington State Department of Ecology became effective in January 1990, and a Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in September 1990. The major components of the ROD included installation of two pump-and-treat systems for the upper aquifer and further investigation of the lower aquifer and other potential sources of contamination. The pump-and-treat systems became operational in August 1995. Fort Lewis asked PNNL to provide technical support in accelerating Installation Restoration Program site remediation and significantly reducing site life-cycle costs at the Logistics Center. In support of this program, ISRM was selected as an innovative technology for <b>bench</b> and field-scale <b>demonstration.</b> Emplacement of the ISRM treatment zone was accomplished through a series of four separate dithionite injection tests conducted between November 10, 1998 and March 29, 2000. An extensive program of chemical monitoring was also performed before, during, and after each injection to evaluate the performance of ISRM. Prior to emplacement of the ISRM treatment zone, the site was extensively characterized with respect to geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical properties. Sediment core samples collected for the characterization studies were analyzed in bench-scale column tests at PNNL to determine reducible iron content. These site-specific hydrogeologic and geochemical data were used to develop the emplacement design of the pilot-scale (i. e., single injection well) ISRM treatment zone. Performance data obtained from the proof-of-principle test indicate that field-scale reductive dechlorination of TCE using the ISRM technology is feasible. A treatment zone was created in the subsurface that reduced TCE concentrations as much as 92 % on the downgradient side of the reduced zone, from a background concentration of approximately 140 ppb to approximately 11 ppb. The appearance of the principal degradation product, acetylene, also confirmed that TCE destruction was occurring. Analysis of sediment samples collected from post-test boreholes showed a high degree of iron reduction, which helped to confirm the effectiveness of the treatment zone emplacement. Another important goal of the testing program was to provide assurances that chemical treatment of the subsurface did not result in undesirable secondary effects, including formation of toxic TCE degradation products, mobilization of trace elements, and degradation of hydraulic performance. Results obtained from the Fort Lewis ISRM proof-of-principle test, which are consistent with results from previous ISRM studies (both bench- and field-scale), indicate that no significant secondary effects were identified that could limit full-scale application of this technology...|$|R
