5|$|Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, {{and even}} made his {{province}} independent {{from the governor}} of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army was tired of constant campaigning and was still riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but {{the leader of the}} native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> was that his old rival, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E

500|$|Arne Glimcher, an {{art dealer}} based in New York City and {{a fan of}} mambo music, learned that Oscar Hijuelos was writing a novel {{relating}} to the subject. In 1988, Hijuelos sent Glimcher a manuscript of his novel The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love. Glimcher purchased the film rights before the novel was published one year later. He hired Cuban-born screenwriter Cynthia Cidre to write the script. Cidre spent {{a year and a}} half working on the screenplay, and after 24 drafts, she had stripped the story down to cover only half of Hijuelos's 407-page book. When asked about the modification of his novel in the film adaptation, Hijuelos said, [...] "My <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> was that the Cuban culture be treated with respect and the music be authentic and accurate to the period." ...|$|E

So, after we watched the rehearsal, and the guys laughed a lot, I said, 'My <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> is, am I mocking your brilliant show too much?' And they said, 'No, do it more!' They're completely unpretentious, David and Dan, and they loved it." [...] He also noted that several other extra scenes were filmed, but were cut from {{the final version of}} the episode, noting that they will likely be released as deleted scenes on the DVD for the season.|$|E

He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, {{is the source of the}} noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for [...] "the common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman.

500|$|The series {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Graham Keal of the Birmingham Post {{wrote of the}} first episode: [...] "Heretical as it might seem, I liked Holby City more than Casualty, not least because the formula {{is so much more}} flexible and unpredictable." [...] Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail praised the series for breaking away from the [...] "dreary sameness" [...] of Casualty, and for presenting [...] "a less hopeless view of the NHS." [...] His <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> about the series was its continuation of patient storylines from Casualty, writing: [...] "if that happens too often, the new programme will soon lose its freshness and sparkle." [...] The Mirror Charlie Catchpole wrote that he was [...] "sick of the sensitive, hand–wringing, non–judgmental do–gooders who mope around the A department in Casualty", praising in comparison the [...] "pushy, ambitious, cynical and generally thoroughly unpleasant surgeons" [...] in Holby City.|$|E
500|$|Childhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon from Essex met Alex James {{when they}} began {{studying}} at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988. Albarn was in a group named Circus, who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October. Circus requested the services of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist. That December, Circus fired two members and James joined as the group's bassist. This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J. D. Salinger's [...] The group performed live {{for the first time}} in summer 1989. In November, Food Records' A representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on [...] "Blur". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{felt that}} as a {{character}} his Doctor lives solely for the present. He avoids thinking about his past because [...] "there's some pain there" [...] – and his <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> regarding the future is that [...] "it's there". Eccleston felt that the character ultimately provides a life-affirming message stating that [...] "In everything the Doctor does, he is saying 'it's great to be alive'." [...] In an interview with Newsround he stated that the Doctor accepts individuals regardless of colour and creed and expressed hope that the Doctor would encourage young children to appreciate life. However, he also drew out differences between the Doctor and traditional children's heroes. The actor described the character as [...] "brutal at times" [...] and [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "inflexible" [...] stating that he [...] "sometimes creates carnage" [...] and that [...] "there's nobody like him in Disney". Matthew Sweet of The Evening Standard highlighted the dichotomy of the character being [...] "brave and wise and brilliant" [...] but also [...] "rough and ready" [...] and [...] "down-to-earth".|$|E

500|$|Donna's {{decision}} {{creates an}} alternate reality with {{major changes in}} history. Donna initially seems happy with her secretary position, her <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> being the claims of her co-workers about seeing a beetle on her back. However, turning right meant that Donna never met the Doctor and could not convince him to flee after killing the Racnoss children in [...] "The Runaway Bride". As a result, the Doctor drowns in the resulting flood, and is unable to intervene in several other events that drastically affect the Earth. Changes include the deaths of Sarah Jane Smith and Martha Jones in the events of [...] "Smith and Jones", the death of sixty {{million people in the}} United States from the breeding of the Adipose in [...] "Partners in Crime", and the loss of the Torchwood team while defeating the Sontaran invasion that occurred during [...] "The Poison Sky". The Doctor's absence also allows the space-going Titanic to crash into Buckingham Palace during [...] "Voyage of the Damned", killing millions in the subsequent destruction of London. England rapidly descends into a dystopia, with many Londoners displaced and forced into assigned cramped living quarters under martial law, with the government soon transferring all non-British citizens into internment camps.|$|E
500|$|Pankhurst put {{the same}} energy and {{determination}} she had previously applied to women's suffrage into patriotic advocacy {{of the war}} effort. She organised rallies, toured constantly delivering speeches, and lobbied the government to help women enter the work force while men were overseas fighting. Another issue which concerned her greatly {{at the time was}} the plight of so-called war babies, children born to single mothers whose fathers were on the front lines. Pankhurst established an adoption home at Campden Hill designed to employ the Montessori method of childhood education. Some women criticised Pankhurst for offering relief to parents of children born out of wedlock, but she declared indignantly that the welfare of children–whose suffering she had seen firsthand as a Poor Law Guardian–was her <b>only</b> <b>concern.</b> Due to lack of funds, however, the home was soon turned over to Princess Alice. Pankhurst herself adopted four children, whom she renamed Kathleen King, Flora Mary Gordon, Joan Pembridge and Elizabeth Tudor. They lived in London, where–for {{the first time in many}} years–she had a permanent home, at Holland Park. Asked how, at the age of 57 and with no steady income, she could take on the burden of bringing up four more children, Pankhurst replied: [...] "My dear, I wonder I didn't take forty." ...|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe's playing {{style was}} elementary, mostly {{sticking}} to root notes of chords. Harry—an art school friend and founder {{and editor of}} the Mersey Beat newspaper—complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent musician whose talents would be better used in the visual arts. While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and often playing {{with his back to the}} audience, their drummer at the time, Best, denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and [...] "animated" [...] before an audience. When the Beatles auditioned for Larry Parnes at the Wyvern Club, Seel Street, Liverpool, Williams later claimed that Parnes would have taken the group as the backing band for Billy Fury for £10 per week (...) , but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the audition—because, as Williams believed, Sutcliffe could not play very well—Parnes said that he would [...] employ the group only if they got rid of Sutcliffe. Parnes later denied this, stating his <b>only</b> <b>concern</b> was that the group had no permanent drummer. Klaus Voormann regarded Sutcliffe as a good bass player, although Beatles' historian Richie Unterberger described Sutcliffe's bass playing as an [...] "artless thump".|$|E
