They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching. A slight genetic difference is noted between the Western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos. The rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia were <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> D. s. niger, but were later recognized to be a synonym of D. s. sumatrensis. Three males and four females currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas, the youngest male having been bred and born there in 2012. Another calf, a female, was born at the sanctuary in May 2016. The sanctuary's two males were born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.|$|E

As a reward, the protagonist earns a title of nobility and is awarded a stronghold, Crossroads Keep, by Neverwinter's political leader, Lord Nasher. After tracking down Ammon Jerro, the warlock who fought the King of Shadows and the grandfather of Shandra Jerro, the player character learns that the King of Shadows was <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Guardian, a powerful creation of the ancient fallen empire of Illefarn. The Guardian was corrupted after tapping into a dark magical energy called the Shadow Weave. Thereafter the Guardian destroyed Illefarn in a misguided attempt to protect it. Ammon is initially unwilling to help the player character, but after inadvertently slaying his descendant Shandra, he repents and joins the party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A {{mile and a half}} from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 {{at the foot of a}} small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E

The Port of Churchill is Canada's only Arctic deep-water port and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia. Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the world's second-largest bay. Manitoba {{is at the heart of}} the giant Hudson Bay watershed, <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Rupert's Land. It was a vital area of the Hudson's Bay Company, with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|Parken Stadium was {{selected}} as the official ground of the final, after a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee. It is located in the Indre Østerbro territory in Copenhagen; the site was <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Idrætsparken, with the opening premiere held in 1911. It was the home of the Denmark national football team and Kjøbenhavns Boldklub's (KB) matches, until 1990, when the venue underwent reconstruction by the Danish lending company Baltica Finans A/S, with the former scrapped in favour of the new name, Parken Stadium. The concept was supported by the Danish Football Association with a contract that all of Denmark's national games would take place at the stadium for fifteen years. The price of the renovation was DKK640 million (£740 million). It made its debut two years later, in 1992, and has since then been the home base for F.C. Copenhagen's fixtures.|$|E
5|$|St Mary the Virgin's Church {{has been}} in {{existence}} since the 12th century and probably much earlier. It was <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Church of St Peter at Westleigh in Leigh, and straddles {{the boundary between the}} old townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard, in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington. Its early history is connected with the Westleigh and Urmston families. Its dedication changed to St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century. The church tower, said to have been built in 1516, is all that remains of the medieval structure, which was replaced by the present church after becoming unsafe. Paley and Austin of Lancaster designed the present church, the foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the church consecrated in 1873.

5|$|The hodge podge of {{architectural}} styles that mingle in the Sycamore Historic District begins with Greek Revival structures which date from Sycamore's foundation {{in the mid}} to late 1830s, also the heyday for that particular style. These structures are the oldest surviving within the district. After the Civil War other styles began to dot the landscape in and around downtown Sycamore, Illinois. Styles such as Italianate, Gothic Revival and Queen Anne can be found throughout the neighborhood. Government buildings and commercial buildings offer prime examples of Classical Revival architecture, a style showcased by the ornate DeKalb County Courthouse, Sycamore Public Library, U.S. Post Office and The National Bank & Trust Co. building.

5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was <b>once</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E
