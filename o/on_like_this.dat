25|$|The {{situation}} on the Narva front was turning into a catastrophe for the German Army Group North. The Leningrad Front had formed bridgeheads both {{north and south of}} Narva, the closest of them a few hundred meters away from Narva–Tallinn Highway. The Sponheimer Group was in direct danger of getting besieged. The defence of the highway was held only by small infantry units formed of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, supported by Panther tanks after every few hundred metres along the highway. They obscured direct observation of the highway by placing branches of spruce trees along it, however, this did not distract the Soviet artillery from keeping the highway under constant bombardment. The faith of the Sponheimer Group, that the defence could go <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> started to diminish.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling staff meetings and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, Apple press officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> all of us will be broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 March {{the escort}} in Via Fani was not {{carrying}} weapons, which were instead {{kept in the}} trunks of the cars; Eleonora Chiavarelli (Aldo Moro's wife) said, during the trial, that the weapons were in the trunks because [...] "these people didn't {{know how to use}} weapons because they never did shooting practice, they hadn't habit to handle them, so that the guns were in the trunk. Leonardi always talked about it. [...] "These people shouldn't have weapons they don't know how to use. They should know how to use them. They should carry them properly. Keep them within reach. The radio should be operational, but it doesn't work." [...] For months it had been going <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Marshal Leonardi and lance corporal Ricci did not expect an ambush, because their weapons were placed in the bag and one of the two holsters was even in a plastic liner." [...] The last sentence was denied by the widow of Marshal Leonardi, stating that her husband [...] "recently went around armed because he had noticed that a car was following him." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} his Fine Arts degree, Klee went to Italy from October 1901 to May 1902 with friend Hermann Haller. They {{stayed in}} Rome, Florence, and Naples, {{and studied the}} master painters of past centuries. He exclaimed, [...] "The Forum and the Vatican have spoken to me. [...] Humanism wants to suffocate me." [...] He responded to the colors of Italy, but sadly noted, [...] "that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color." [...] For Klee, color represented the optimism and nobility in art, and a hope for relief from the pessimistic nature he expressed in his black-and-white grotesques and satires. Returning to Bern, {{he lived with his}} parents for several years, and took occasional art classes. By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his Portrait of My Father (1906). In the years 1903-5 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate etchings called Inventions, his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters. He commented, [...] "though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go <b>on</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> [...] I’m not a specialist." [...] Klee was still dividing his time with music, playing the violin in an orchestra and writing concert and theater reviews.|$|E
