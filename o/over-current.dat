40|$|The STATCOM (Synchronous Static Compensator) {{based on}} voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) {{is used for}} voltage regulation in transmission and distribution system. The STATCOM can rapidly supply dynamic VARs required during system faults for voltage support. Strict requirements of STATCOM losses and total system loss penalty preclude the use of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) for VSC based STATCOM applications. This constraint of implementing VSC without PWM functionality, results in <b>over-currents</b> and trips of the STATCOM during and after system faults, when its VAR support functionality is most required. In this paper, we propose and develop an “emergency PWM ” strategy to prevent <b>over-currents</b> (and trips) in the VSC during and after single line to ground system faults, LLLG faults {{and to ensure that}} the STATCOM supplies required reactive power.

50|$|The {{choice of}} circuit breaker is {{also based on}} the normal rated current of the circuit. Modern circuit {{breakers}} have overload and short circuit current protection combined. The overload protection is for protection of the equipment against sustained small-to-medium increase in current above the rated current, while short circuit protection is {{for the protection of}} the conductors against high <b>over-currents</b> due to short circuits.|$|R
25|$|Residual-current {{detection}} is complementary to <b>over-current</b> detection. Residual-current detection cannot {{provide protection}} for overload or short-circuit currents, {{except for the}} special case of a short circuit from live to ground (not live to neutral).|$|E
25|$|Each Category rating also {{specifies}} maximum safe transient voltages {{for selected}} measuring ranges in the meter.

25|$|A residual-current {{circuit breaker}} cannot remove all risk of {{electric}} shock or fire. In particular, an RCD alone will not detect overload conditions, phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits (see three-phase electric power). <b>Over-current</b> protection (fuses or circuit breakers) must be provided. Circuit breakers that combine the functions of an RCD with overcurrent protection respond to both types of fault. These are known as RCBOs and are available in 2-, 3- and 4-pole configurations. RCBOs will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism.|$|E

Large spontaneous oscillations of the surface temperature were observed and attributed to the interplay between the activation/deactivation of nucleate boiling and the highly nonlinear heat generation of the superconductor {{as a function of}} temperature. Two distinct steady states of 8 and 3 K superheating were also found for samples carrying 300 A, depending on the current cycle history...|$|R
40|$|Requests {{for high}} quality and {{continuity}} of supply {{have led to}} the study of DC micro-grids. The realization of these networks would allow exploitation of DC advantages, but it would also create fault clearance and selectivity problems because semi-conductors suffer <b>over-currents</b> and over-voltages. The use of traditional DC circuit breakers is often not acceptable. As an alternative, static switches can be installed to solve these problems, in spite of increases in power loss. In this work, a multi-port converter is proposed to solve the aforementioned problems. In addition, it is able to manage power flows and AC and DC I/O, improve stability, and decouple port voltages...|$|R

25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term <b>over-current</b> conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and <b>over-current</b> protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E

The resulting torque transients are evaluated and their propagation in the drive train is examined. Important conclusions are drawn With respect {{to the type of}} electrical faults to be considered in the design and certification of WTs according to the current IEC 61400 - 1 Standard.

Some older systems used a thermal <b>over-current</b> trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset. [...] The switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} admittance based method for fault location analysis of distribution systems. Based on the measurements {{collected from the}} feeder breakers and intelligent switches during a fault, the fault type and faulted feeder section are first deter-mined by examining the over-voltages and <b>over-currents</b> on the breakers/switches. The load demands, faulted line segment and fault location are then determined sequentially by finding a set of loads, a line segment and a fault location that has minimal distance between the currents measured at {{the boundaries of the}} feeder section, and the estimated currents deter-mined by multiplying the measured voltages by an equivalent admittance matrix determined for the feeder section when applying the given load and fault conditions to the feeder section. The proposed approach determines the equivalent admittance matrix for a feeder section with one or two measuring ports through topology and circuit analysis, and for a feeder section with more than two measuring ports through Kron reduction on nodal admittance matrix. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Doubly fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) based wind turbines {{are sensitive to}} grid faults due to utilising small-scale rotor side converter (RSC). The application of crowbar protection to improve the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of the DFIG converts it to a squirrel cage {{induction generator}}, which {{makes it difficult to}} comply with grid codes. This study proposes an innovative DC-link controllable fault current limiter (C-FCL) based FRT scheme for the RSC to improve the FRT capability of the DFIG. The proposed scheme replaces the AC crowbar protection and eliminates its disadvantages. The C-FCL does not affect the normal operation of the DFIG. By means of the proposed scheme, rotor <b>over-currents</b> are successfully limited during balanced and unbalanced grid faults, even at zero grid voltage. Also, the C-FCL prevents rotor acceleration and high torque oscillations. In this study, an analysis of the proposed approach is presented in detail. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the conventional crowbar protection scheme through simulation studies carried out in power system computeraided design/electromagnetic transients, including dc software (PSCAD/EMTDC). Moreover, the main concept of the proposed approach is validated with an experimental setup and test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{feasibility}} of the Bipolar-Injection Field Effect-Transistor (BIFET) [5] in two different Dual Thyristor type circuits [4] for an application as solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) is experimentally verified. The Dual Thyristor type circuits are assembled from discrete silicon JFETs and a silicon carbide BIFET and are electrically characterized at various temperatures. The current-voltage characteristic shows the expected regenerative self-triggered turn-off capability under <b>over-currents</b> and the option to control the turn-off current by a passive resistor network. The issue with the adverse positive temperature coefficient of the trigger-current can be solved by putting the SiC BIFET in a cascode arrangement with a silicon Dual Thyristor. In this configuration the SiC BIFET provides the high voltage blocking capability and the silicon Dual Thyristor with its negative temperature coefficient controls the trigger-current. Transient analyses of both circuits indicate fast switching times of less than 50 μs seconds. It is demonstrated for the first time, that the SiC BIFET, due to its normally-on behaviour, used in a Dual Thyristor type circuit is a promising concept for self-triggered fuses in high current and high voltage applications...|$|R
2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have <b>over-current</b> protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E

The {{study of}} the thermal {{stability}} process in second-generation (2 G) high-temperature superconductors is important to determine its optimal performance in applications. When a fault takes place during operation, the heat generated must be evacuated {{as fast as possible}} {{in order to protect the}} superconductor from damage. If conductors are immersed in liquid nitrogen (LN), thermal stability is strongly dependent on the tape orientation, proximity between tapes, and the characteristics of the surface, such as roughness, presence of insulating materials covering the conductor, etc., which will influence the recovery time of the conductor after a fault. In this contribution, we analyze quench and cooling processes of 2 G conductors subjected to <b>over-currents</b> and immersed in LN.

40|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) -based wind turbines utilise small-scale voltage sourced converters {{with a limited}} overcurrent withstand capability, which makes the DFIG-based wind turbines very vulnerable to grid faults. Often, modern {DFIG} systems employ a crowbar protection at the rotor circuit to protect the rotor side converter (RSC) during grid faults. This method converts the {DFIG} to a squirrel cage {{induction generator}}, which does not comply with the new grid codes. The recent grid codes need wind turbines to stay connected to the utility grid during and after power system faults, especially in high penetration level of wind power. Furthermore, the crowbar switch is expensive. This paper proposes a novel DC-link switchable resistive-type fault current limiter (SRFCL) to improve the {LVRT} capability of the DFIG. The proposed {SRFCL} is employed in the {DC} side of the RSC. The {SRFCL} solves crowbar protection activation problems and eliminates subsequent complications in the {DFIG} system. The proposed {SRFCL} {{does not have any}} significant impact on the overall performance of the {DFIG} during normal operation. Whenever the fault, whether symmetrical or asymmetrical, occurs, the {SRFCL} not only limits rotor <b>over-currents</b> but also prevents rotor speed acceleration and restricts high torque oscillations even during zero grid voltage, as recommended by some grid codes. To prove the effective operation of the {SRFCL} on the {RSC} fault current limitation, analytical analysis is performed in each switching interval. The proposed approach is compared with the crowbar-based protection method. Simulation studies are carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC software. In addition, a prototype is provided to demonstrate the main concept of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Hybridization of {{the metro}} {{traction}} systems has been the research focus {{during the last few}} years. Research has been done on various technologies that combine, in addition to its main energy source (DC rail), reversible energy storage devices like fly-wheels, ultra-capacitors, and batteries. Among these technologies, ultra-capacitors are promising because of their high power density and the fact that their lifespan is about ten years longer than that of batteries. The idea is to store the regenerative braking energy in an ultra-capacitor module. This energy will be used during the acceleration. As such, the grid will be protected from the <b>over-currents</b> related to start-up {{of the metro}} car. Moreover, the traction system efficiency will increase since the braking energy which is dissipated in resistors in the current system, will be recovered. In this thesis the Montreal Metro Traction system is studied. The main energy source (MES) is the DC rail in Metro. The metro system is first analysed and model. Ultra-capacitor sizing is done for the system. For the purpose of simulation, the initial system is scaled down. A 2 Hp machine is used as the traction motor. A bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter is designed to drive the motor. The ultra-capacitor interfaced bidirectional DC/DC converter and the ultra-capacitor bank are modeled and simulated. A unidirectional boost DC/DC converter is designed and simulated along with PI controllers, to control the flow of power from the DC rail (MES). Moreover, two efficient supervisory control strategies are developed for two possible ultra-capacitor bank sizes of the Montreal metro system.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind resource around the seas of the UK {{is a very}} large renewable energy resource. Future {{offshore wind}} farm sites leased by the Crown Estate for Round 3 development will need high power capacity grid connection, but their remote location presents a challenge for the electrical connection to the grid. Long distance AC cable transmission is not practical due to the large cable capacitance which leads to reactive power loss. This thesis considers the voltage source converter and high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) technology as the future grid connection for the offshore wind farm network, which is more controllable and has better transmission efficiencies for long distance and high power cable transmission applications. The offshore AC network is weak with very little inertia and has limited rating at the HVDC converter substation. The dynamics in key variables in the offshore wind farm AC network and how they affect certain components in the system were studied. Without proper control, the offshore voltage and the frequency will be sensitive to change. The capacitor of the AC filter at the offshore VSC-HVDC station was found to be vulnerable to over-voltage, therefore a closed loop AC voltage controller was proposed here to maintain a constant capacitor voltage and to prevent tripping or over-voltage damage. The tuning of the control gains were optimised with a pole placement design method and small signal analysis for observing the system eigenvalue damping. The control parameters were then tuned for a fast and well damped controller. The AC voltage controller was evaluated and compared to an open loop system. The controller was able to limit the resonance in the LC filter that can be triggered by large and fast disturbances in the current, voltage and frequency. Current saturation could be implemented within the control structure for device protection from <b>over-currents.</b> Insight on how the wind turbine fully rated frequency converters and controllers may interact with the VSC-HVDC converter station is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) modules (direct current) have {{continued}} to decrease in price {{over the past decade}} causing the number of PV installations to increase. With increase in use of PV renewable resources come more interconnections to the electrical power grid and hence system protection challenges for planning engineers. PV inverters (direct current to alternating current interconnections) do not behave like traditional generators having rotational inertia and long-lived electrical time constants. In contrast, inverters have no inertial mass and very short time constants. Manufacturers do not provide inverter design details. Therefore, current inverter circuit models available for studying inverter behavior and completing inverter grid integration tasks are not adequate. In addition, the inverter models currently used by planning engineers only provide steady state solutions; not accurate time-domain results for rapid load changes especially during electrical circuit fault conditions. Inadequate and inaccurate planning models result in unreliable system protection designs, leading to possible operational failure, mis-coordination of protective equipment, and system damage. Valid transient models are necessary to plan for unusual circuit conditions including overvoltages, grounding conditions, and anti-islanding on electric grid feeders connected to photovoltaic resources or utilities desiring to add photovoltaic resources to an existing feeder. This research makes an original contribution by providing a modeling solution for solar PV inverter transients using the Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) mathematical structure. The analysis is based on laboratory test data from single-phase, micro, and three-phase inverters. Data was collected during open-circuit, short-circuit and voltage sag events. Each inverter was tested at multiple output power levels and multiple tests were run for each case to account for point-on-wave effects on the transient magnitudes. The HW framework, which integrates linear dynamics and nonlinearities, provides a framework for the transient PV inverter model. The model was incorporated into an open source distribution simulation software; OpenDSS. Test results show that PV inverters cause significant over-voltages and <b>over-currents</b> during transient events, but these have been difficult to predict accurately in simulations. The OpenDSS model provides a solution for modeling these nonlinear behaviors for design and operating studies and can be expanded to incorporate other power system components...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Magister Technologiae: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 The space environment is characterised by harsh radiation, extreme temperatures and vacuum. Electronics subsystems for satellite applications {{are designed to be}} fault tolerant and robust enough to survive this environment. A power distribution module (PDM) for a CubeSat nanosatellite application is developed here, with the aim to distribute power to CubeSat subsystems reliably. The PDM prototype is carefully designed with reference to an extensive literature study. The study dwells on the low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment, critically identifying radiation sources and temperature ranges in the LEO. The study further investigates traditional analogue techniques of logic circuit design using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) which are known for their higher tolerance to radiation sources as compared to recent integrated circuits (ICs). Careful consideration is given to different ways of designing a fault tolerant system. The study specifically looks at redundant circuit design within the limitations of weight and space of a nanosatellite. Possible electrical faults in power systems are identified, which include <b>over-currents,</b> over-voltages, over-temperatures, inrush currents and latchup. This study shows that identified faults generally are overcurrents. A power switch is included in each power distribution channel to trip the current in case a faulty condition is detected. The PDM is designed to have eight power output distribution channels to allow a subsystem load to connect to more than one channel, thereby meeting its power requirements. The PDM power channels are designed identically. Upon application, current limits are selected by a two-resistor divider circuit and connectors are used to connect to a required voltage bus at manufacturing time. The system’s functionality is tested and verified using an Arduino development board interfaced to all I 2 C devices as a master node, typically the on-board computer (OBC) in a real satellite mission. The system’s functionality in a Gamma irradiated laboratory environment is verified to perform as required. The PDM system is further tested in a temperature cycled chamber from - 31 °C to 61 °C. The system survived the entire eight hour test duration of two cycles. It is observed that the system is fault tolerant to radiation sources up to 10 krad and the temperature limits mentioned. The PDM system is recommended as an additional module to the CubeSat electrical power subsystem (EPS), thereby improving the reliability of the power subsystem.
