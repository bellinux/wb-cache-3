5|$|George V disliked {{sitting for}} {{portrait}}s and despised modern art; {{he was so}} displeased by one portrait by Charles Sims that he <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to be burned. He did admire sculptor Bertram Mackennal, who created statues of George for display in Madras and Delhi, and William Reid Dick, whose statue of George V stands outside Westminster Abbey, London.|$|E
5|$|Sesma's {{battalion}} of approximately 725 men and artillery camped {{on the opposite}} side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> burned. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.|$|E
5|$|Bessas first sent an {{expeditionary force}} to {{suppress}} a rebellion among the Abasgians, who neighboured Lazica to the north. The expedition, under John Guzes, was successful, and the Abasgian leader Opsites {{was forced to}} flee across the Caucasus to the Sabir Huns. In spring 551, after a long siege and thanks largely to his own perseverance and bravery, the Byzantines and their Sabir allies (some 6,000 troops) captured Petra. A few Persians continued to resist from the citadel, but Bessas <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> torched. Following his victory, he ordered the city walls razed to the ground.|$|E

5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|E
5|$|In 1221 the castle's owner, William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, {{rebelled against}} Henry III; the {{fortification}} {{was captured by}} royalist forces and the King <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to be destroyed. The remains of the castle had little value {{by the end of}} the 14th century and Skipsea Brough failed to attract many inhabitants. The castle passed into the control of the state in the early 20th century and various archaeological investigations were carried out between 1987 and 2001. In the 21st century, Skipsea Castle is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E

However, when his support dwindled, the principal men of the county returned their allegiance to King Henry V. During the English Civil War, Parliamentary forces under Colonel Roland Laugharne besieged and captured Carmarthen Castle but later abandoned the cause, and joined the Royalists. In 1648, Carmarthen Castle was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, and Oliver Cromwell <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to be slighted.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Disney and {{his family}} moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills {{district}} of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it Lilly Belle after his wife; after three years Disney <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, in {{a federal}} {{district}} court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. On August 17, 2006, that {{court ruled that the}} warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> ended immediately. However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The Bush administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{artillery}} during September 7 shelled batteries of the 9th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions, forcing {{displacement of}} two batteries during the day. US air strikes and artillery kept both Hills 902 and 570 under heavy attack. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere that day, Walker <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> and the ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka-san. He directed the ROK 1st Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division {{to select a}} boundary between them and to maintain physical contact during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Repeated American attacks {{resulted}} in a stalemate. By the morning of 7 August, North Koreans were able to press forward and capture the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, a newly arrived unit, {{was sent to the}} region. 24th Infantry Division commander Major General John H. Church immediately <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to attack the Naktong Bulge salient. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E
5|$|The German Church of Scientology has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff {{and members of the}} Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E

Due {{to the situation}} on the right flank of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> and Detachment Ormozki to withdraw from the Drava to behind the Bednja to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|The first Formula Three Brabham, the BT9, {{won only}} four major races in 1964. The BT15 which {{followed}} in 1965 {{was a highly}} successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. Further developments of the same concept, including wings {{by the end of}} the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were <b>ordered,</b> <b>it</b> was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.|$|E
5|$|The type genus, Lily (Lilium), has a {{long history}} in {{literature}} and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a floral emblem, particularly of France (fleur-de-lis).

However, the name 'lily' has historically been applied {{to a wide variety of}} plants other than the Lilium genus.|$|E

5|$|When Daniels was elected, {{he stated}} his number one {{priority}} was job creation. To achieve that goal, he created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), became chairman of its board, and <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> to “act {{at the speed of}} business, not the speed of government,” to attract new jobs. During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 new jobs and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy. By the end of the administration, IEDC claimed to have closed on almost 1,500 deals to create a projected 169,000 new jobs since 2005.|$|E
5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was <b>ordered.</b> <b>It</b> discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly <b>ordered</b> <b>it</b> into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E
