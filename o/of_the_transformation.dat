To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation.</b> One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E

5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> basic {{question}} <b>of</b> this paper is: If you consider two iterated function systems {{close to one}} another in an appropriate topology, are <b>the</b> dimensions <b>of</b> their respective invariant sets close to one another? It is well-known that the Hausdorff dimension (and Lebesgue measure) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invariant set do not depend continuously on the iterated function system. Our main result is that (with a restriction on <b>the</b> ‘non-conformality’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformations)</b> <b>the</b> Hausdorff dimension is a lower semi-continuous function in the C 1 - topology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iterated function system. The same question is raised <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebesgue measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invariant set.

25|$|Transformations {{describing}} {{relative motion}} with constant (uniform) velocity and without {{rotation of the}} space coordinate axes are called boosts, and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation.</b> The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames {{since there is no}} relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> (e.g., axis–angle representation, or Euler angles, etc.).
