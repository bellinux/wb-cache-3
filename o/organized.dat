5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean.

Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E

30|$|Since DEEs are {{different}} from traditional forms of <b>organizing</b> as they lack traditional <b>organizing</b> elements such as formal authority, the solutions to these four problems may be different and worthwhile exploring (Puranam et al., 2014).

These universal problems of <b>organizing</b> provide us with an operational framework to analyze the <b>organizing</b> activities in DEEs.|$|R
