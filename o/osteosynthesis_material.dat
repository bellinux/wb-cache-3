40|$|Introduction : S’il a été montré que les prothèses métalliques, notamment de hanche, peuvent être impliquées dans certains cas d’imprégnation par le chrome, le matériel d’ostéosynthèse est beaucoup plus rarement considéré comme une source potentielle de ce type de relargage. Observation : Un peintre en aéronautique de 33 ans fait l’objet d’un dosage de chrome urinaire (par SAAE) par la médecine du travail qui révèle une imprégnation nettement supérieure aux autres salariés suivis (20, 2 μg/g créatinine vs   Introduction: Although it {{has been}} proven that metal {{prostheses}} (including hip prostheses) {{may be involved in}} systemic chromium impregnation, <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> has rarely been described as such a source of metal release. Observation: In the framework of occupational medical monitoring, the urinary results of a 33 -year-old aeronautic painter revealed a chromium impregnation clearly superior to those of his colleagues (20. 2 μg/g creatinine; < 1 μg/g for all others – EAAS method). Renal, ENT and respiratory exams were normal. The patient was removed from his exposed workstation but the chromium impregnation did not decrease, even after several months away from the workstation. Extra-professional sources were then searched for, {{and the role of the}} patient’s <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> was revealed: urinary dosage of nickel and molybdenum (2 other metals present in the osteosynthesis alloy) was done and proved the presence of these metals five months after the end of any occupational exposure (nickel 24. 5 μg/g creatinine – general population normal level: < 3. 8 μg/g –). The patient was still asymptomatic but he requested removal of the material. During this surgery it was observed that the plate fixed on the right femur was degraded. The urinary chromium level then decreased (0. 6 μg/g creatinine 4 months after the material removal), confirming the role of the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material.</b> The painter was then allowed to return to his workplace. Conclusion: This case, fortuitously discovered, suggests that chromium impregnation related to <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> is underestimated. Prescribers of metal ion analysis should be warned, and should systematically look for patients’ surgical history...|$|E

Unterschiede sind hauptsächlich im Resorptionsverhalten und den Festigkeitseigenschaften zu suchen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die klinische und sonographische Untersuchung eines Osteosynthesesystems, dessen Resorbierbarkeit besonders hervorgehoben wird. PATIENTEN UND METHODIK Das resorbierbare Material aus reinem Poly D, L-Laktid (50 : 50 PDLLA) wurde zur Versorgung von 26 Mittelgesichtsfrakturen 2 Stirnhöhlenvorderwandfrakturen, einer Le-Fort I Osteotomie und einer Kraniosynostose im Rahmen einer retrospektiven Studie eingesetzt. Die Polymerdegradation wurde dabei prospektiv in viermonatigen Abständen sonographisch beurteilt. ERGEBNISSE Die Resorption betreffend zeigten sich äußerst unterschiedliche Verläufe mit vereinzelt sonographisch bestätigter Resorption ab dem 20 Monat nach Implantation. Im Durchschnitt lagen jedoch 20 bis 24 Monate nach Implantation sonographisch hochgradig veränderte Polymere vor, deren Resorption noch nicht abgeschlossen war. In einem Fall trat 13 Monate nach Frakturversorgung eine Fremdkörperreaktion auf, wie sie aus früheren Studien an biodegradierbarer Osteosynthese beschrieben ist. Die Platten besaßen für den nicht kaubelasteten Gesichtsschädelbereich ausreichende Stabilität, jedoch traten in 9, 1 % Schraubenfrakturen auf. SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG Insgesamt stellte sich die Sonographie als eine hervorragende Methode dar, den Umwandlungsprozess der Polymere im Rahmen der Degradation zu visualisieren. Für das untersuchte Osteosynthesematerial ließ sich eine Eignung für die Osteosynthese des nicht kaubelasteten Gesichtsschädels herausarbeiten. Introduction: At {{present a}} {{multitude}} of biodegradable <b>osteosyntheses</b> <b>materials</b> is available. Differences mainly concern their degradation process and their stability. The {{aim of this study}} was the clinical and sonographic examination of a new <b>osteosyntheses</b> <b>material</b> which is thought to be highly resorbable. Patients and methods: In terms of a retrospective study we evaluated results after utilising poly-(D,L) lactide (50 : 50 PDLLA) in 26 patients with midfacial fractures, 2 cases of frontal sinus fractures and one Le-Fort-I osteotomie and one craniosynostosis. The degradation process was prospectively evaluated by ultrasound examination every 4 months. Results: The time of degradation markedly varied. Sporadically complete resorption was found sonographically 20 months post-implantation. In average however 20 to 24 months after implantation the polymers were found to be highly altered but not yet resorbed as found by ultrasound. In one case we encountered a foreign body reaction 13 months after fracture fixation, as it was described earlier with other biodegradable materials. Plate stability was sufficient for non-load bearing areas of the face, yet in 9. 1 % srew-fractures occurred. Conclusion: Overall sonography is an excellent instrument for visualising the degradation progress of resorbable polymers. The <b>osteosyntheses</b> <b>material</b> evaluated in this study is suited for bony fixation in non-load bearing areas of the scull and face...|$|R
30|$|Patient RF was a 42 -year-old {{man who had}} a {{left side}} os acromiale with an {{impingement}} syndrome. He was first treated by a colleague orthopaedic surgeon, who performed three surgeries. The first was an arthroscopic limited decompression, followed by fixation with K-wires and tension band wiring. Because of an infection and perforation of the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>materials,</b> they were removed and replaced by two Acutrak screws. However, a monitoring CT showed loosening of these screws. The patient continued to suffer from a loss of strength and pain at night. As an alternative approach, an osteosynthesis using a distal clavicle osteosynthesis plate was performed. Fixation was achieved using cortical and angle-stable locking screws (4 × 10  mm and 2 × 12  mm). One compression screw was used. A bone graft was harvested from the left iliac crest and applied at the osteotomy site.|$|R
30|$|Alternative {{methods for}} {{intraoperative}} bone realignment have been reported. In one method, parallel pin pairs are {{inserted in the}} distal and proximal bone segment using a drill guide. After osteotomy, the pin pairs are inserted into a reduction guide to achieve reduction [10]. Other techniques use drilling and cutting guides to predrill holes for subsequent fixation using standard <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> [11], or by using patient-specific fixation plates that provide accurate alignment of the bone segments [4, 12, 13]. All these approaches may reduce the surgical error but do not allow any deviation from the preoperative plan {{in cases where the}} planned rotation angle appears unfeasible during surgery.|$|E
40|$|Propionibacterium acnes is {{the most}} {{frequent}} anaerobic pathogen found in spondylodiscitis. A documented case required microbiological proof of P. acnes with clinical and radiological confirmation of inflammation in a localized region of the spine. Microbiological samplings were obtained by surgery or aspiration under radiological control. Twelve males and 17 females (median age, 42 years) with spondylodiscitis due to P. acnes were diagnosed within the last 15 years. Three patients were immunosuppressed. All patients reported back pain as the main symptom, and most were afebrile. Three patients had a peripheral neurological deficit, one a motor deficit, and two a sensory deficit attributable to the infection; and six patients had an epidural abscess. The most frequent risk factor was surgery, which was present in the history 28 of 29 (97 %) patients. The mean delay between spinal surgery and onset of disease was 34 months, {{with a wide range}} of 0 - 156 months. <b>Osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> was present in twenty-two cases (76 %). In 24 (83 %) patients, additional surgery, such as debridement or spondylodesis, was performed.

40|$|The ideal {{temporary}} implant {{should offer}} enough mechanical support to allow healing of the fracture and then biodegrade and be resorbed by metabolic mechanisms without causing any toxic effect. The {{aim of this}} research has been to simultaneously study in situ bone healing and the biodegradation of AZ 31 Mg alloy as an <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material.</b> The in vivo study {{was carried out in}} AZ 31 implants with and without Mg-fluoride coating inserted in un-fractured and fractured femurs of Wistar rats for long experimentation time, from 1 to 13 [*]months, by means of computed tomography, histological and histomorphometric analysis. Tomography analysis showed the bone healing and biodegradation of AZ 31 implants. The fracture is healed in 100 % of the animals, and AZ 31 maintains its mechanical integrity throughout the healing process. Biodegradation was monitored, quantifying the evolution of gas over time by 3 D composition of tomography images. In all the studied groups, gas pockets disappear with time {{as a result of the}} diffusion process through soft tissues. Histomorphometric studies reveal that after 13 [*]months the 46. 32 % of AZ 31 alloy has been resorbed. The resorption of the coated and uncoated AZ 31 implants inserted in fractured femurs after 1, 9 and 13 [*]months does not have statistically significant differences. There is a balance between the biodegradation of AZ 31 and bone healing which allows the use of AZ 31 to be proposed as an <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material.</b> The authors are grateful to MINECO, Spain, for financial support of projects MAT 2008 - 06719 -C 03 - 01 - 03 and MAT 2011 - 29152 -C 02 - 01.

Since more than 100 years, various surgical techniques for mandibular repositioning have been developed and clinically tested. Since the establishment of plate and screw osteosynthesis, orthognathic surgery became more stable and safe. Nowadays, different surgical methods for mobilising the mandible are existing. This international multicenter analysis (n = 51 hospitals) is providing first evidence based data for the current use of different surgical methods. The dominating techniques were Obwegeser/dal Pont (61 %) followed by Hunsuck/Epker (37 %) and Perthes/Schlössmann (29 %).

40|$|Platelets are small, irregularly shaped {{blood cells}} which {{play a vital}} role for the {{preservation}} of life. These anuclear cells (diameter 2 - 3 mm) are derived from fragmentation of precursor megakaryocytes and their main function is in primary hemostasis. In addition, platelets are considered a significant natural source of growth factors for tissue repair after trauma and other causes of tissue damage. The importance of sufficient number of platelets with normal function in order to conduct surgical operations is obvious. The platelet function analyzer PFA- 100 ®, has been designed to provide an in vitro measurement of primary hemostasis simply, quickly, quantitatively and accurately to aid in the routine screening of patients with potential hemorrhagic risk due to abnormal platelet plug formation. Titanium is a chemical element which belongs to the fourth group and period of the periodic table (group of transition metals) with main characteristics its low density, strength, ductility, corrosion and heat resistance. These properties of titanium have made it an attractive material for implant construction. Although Ti is not the strongest metal, its relatively low specific gravity gives it a very favorable strength to weight – ratio. Therefore titanium implants possess capable load sharing properties decreasing the problems associated with stress shielding. In hip arthroplasties, mandible implants and <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>materials</b> as well, titanium dioxide, a byproduct of titanium corrosion, has been found adjacent to titanium implants in regional lymph nodes and in some instances in remote organs. The purpose of this study was, by the use of the PFA- 100 ® system, to determine whether surgically placed titanium implants and its degradation products {{have a significant effect on}} platelet function. In addition, our aim was to evaluate the effect of TiO 2 on cellular proliferation. After an institutional review board approval, 33 patients with titanium maxillofacial implants (<b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>materials)</b> and 34 healthy volunteer blood donors were recruited to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria were : patients older than 18 years of age, Hematocrit (HCT) ? 35 %, platelet (PLT) count ? 150. 000 / μL and implants consisted of titanium alloy placed 80 at least 12 months before. Individuals were randomly selected between hundreds of patients that were treated for mandibular fractures and dental implants placement in our Clinic. Exclusion criteria were: past medical history of bleeding disorders, liver and renal disease, connective tissue diseases, pregnancy, antiplatelet therapy during the previous ten days and every medication which may affect platelet function (N.

Patients - methods: Representative cases of patients who underwent osteotomies, in which osteosynthesis was achieved by means of bioabsorbable material are presented. Results: Depending on their individual preoperative planning, patients underwent the following operations: typical LeFort I maxillary osteotomy, mandibular sagittal split osteotomy and horizontal genioplasty to correct progenism.

We hypothesized that the combined use of PDGF-BB with synthetic peptides could result in an increase in proliferation and calcification of osteoblast-like cells. Methods Osteoblast-like cell cultures were treated with PDGF and synthetic peptides, singly and as combinations, and compared to non-treated control cell cultures. The cultures were evaluated at days 2, 5, and 10 in terms of cell proliferation, calcification and gene expression of alkaline phosphate, collagen I and osteocalcin. Results Experimental findings revealed that the addition of PDGF, p- 15 and TP 508 and combinations of PDGF/AC- 100, PDGF/p- 15 and PDGF/TP 508 resulted in an increase in proliferating osteoblasts, especially in the first 5 days of cultivation. Proliferation did not significantly differ between single factors and factor combinations (p > 0. 05). The onset of calcification in osteoblasts occurred earlier and was more distinct compared to the corresponding control or PDGF stimulation alone. Significant difference was found for the combined use of PDGF/p- 15 and PDGF/AC- 100 (p Conclusions Our findings indicate that PDGF exhibits cooperative effects with synthetic peptides in differentiation and proliferation. These cooperative effects cause a significant early calcification of osteoblast-like cells (p < 0. 05). We suggest the combination of synthetic peptides and PDGF as a potential clinical approach for accelerating bone healing or coating <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>materials.</b> </p...|$|R
5000|$|Sailer and {{his team}} {{were among the first}} people to develop the resorbable osteosynthetic {{material}}s. The osteosynthetic material made from resorbable lactic acid-based substances is used for fixation of bone fractures as well as for fixation of bones after orthopaedic operations of the skull, the mandible and the maxilla. The material developed can be bent in the cold state as well as moulded in the hot state. As it disintegrates on its own after a programmable period, no second operation for removal of the material is necessary, whereas in case of <b>osteosynthesis</b> with metallic <b>materials</b> a second operation is required ...|$|R
40|$|As {{with other}} techniques, {{vertical}} distraction osteogenesis (VDO) can also induce complications. The {{case of a}} patient with a residual alveolar ridge in the symphyseal area of 8 mm is presented. After performing VDO, the patient returned at 1 -day postoperatively complaining of pain and dislocation of the distractor device, due to a fracture of the lower mandibular segment on the right side. After removal of the distractor device and application of osteosynthesis plates, the patient returned 2 weeks later due to a second fracture of the lower segment, yet on the left side. After removing the <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material,</b> stabilization of the mandible was achieved with an acrylic splint, which was fixated with peri-mandibular wiring. Finally, reconstruction was accomplished by lower border onlay grafting, limited to the symphyseal area, in preparation for implant insertion. Ultimately, after a healing period of 5 months, two endosseous implants were installed. The patient's function has remained satisfactory for 3 years. Reinforcement of the extreme resorbed edentulous mandible after fracture healing by lower border bone augmentation can be a reliable method to allow implant installation in a second stage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo our knowledge, {{proximal}} tibiofibular joint instability {{has never}} been reported in a patient with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We present {{the case of a}} patient with anterolateral proximal tibiofibular joint instability associated with a complex primary TKA. In 2010, a male patient of 47 years was referred for TKA after posttraumatic osteoarthritis. The patient's history includes a fracture of the left lateral tibial plateau in 2008 and removal of <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> in 2009. TKA with a lateral metal augment and intramedullary stem was performed in 2010. After TKA, instability of the left proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) was diagnosed. The patient underwent PTFJ arthrodesis and, at 5 years' follow-up, had no residual pain, with full range of motion. In this case, arthrodesis was the only possible surgical option because reconstruction surgeries require the establishment of bone tunnels in the tibia and fibula for the passage of a graft. Low bone quality and the use of an intramedullary stem with a metal augment in the tibia made any reconstruction technique unfeasible because the proximal tibia was obliterated. Although several PTFJ reconstruction techniques are available, they are difficult to apply to patients with a complex TKA...|$|E
40|$|Lisfranc midfoot dislocations include {{bone and}} {{ligament}} injuries to the tarsometatarsal joint complex. Rarelesion, with an incidence rate of 1 to 55, 000 patients annually, 20 % of injuries remain undiagnosed. Mechanisms ofinjury are direct and indirect, including traffic accidents and sports. Clinical {{signs and symptoms}} are: midfoot pain,inability to bear weight, leg deformity and swelling, and plantar ecchymosis. Pedal artery or deep peroneal nerve maybe compromised and the compartment syndrome may occur. Radiographic incidences reveal changes and dislocationsin tarsometatarsal interlining. Stress radiographs are helpful in unstable lesions. CT is used for diagnosis andpreoperative planning. Lisfranc injury classifications can not determine the treatment or suggest prognosis. Nonsurgicaltreatment for stable injuries (2 mm displacement). Medialand middle columns are fixed with 3. 5 mm screws, and lateral column with Kirschner pins. Postoperative care includesearly mobilization, progressive weight-bearing, and <b>osteosynthesis</b> <b>material</b> removal. Primary tarsometatarsalarthrodesis is an alternative in lesions with severe joint damage. Immediate complications are common, includingneurovascular injury and compartment syndrome, and late complications are posttraumatic midfoot arthrosis,algoneurodistrofic syndrome, chronic foot pain, implant deterioration. Patients require a long rehabilitation period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fractures of the {{clavicle}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common fractures in modern orthopaedics and traumatology practice. Knowing the mechanism of trauma, and it's pathophysiological elements, it's clear distinction and it's individual features are essential to the development of more new and effective methods for their treatment, and the minimising of postoperative complications. AIM: The aim of this paper was to present the results of our patients treated with minimally invasive plate <b>osteosynthesis</b> (MIPO). <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: Between January 2011 and March 2013, 12 patients were treated with MIPO technique. The mean age was 47. 5 years (range, 16 - 79 years). Outcomes and complications of clinical treatment were reviewed. RESULTS: All fractures healed within a mean period of 4. 9 months (range, 2 - 10 months). Regarding complications, there was no occurrence of implant failure or deep infection. There were no nonunions, but one 79 -year-old man had a delayed union. Almost of all the cases didn’t need bending of the plate. Seven plates were removed by their hopes. And there weren’t any cases that required new incisions. CONCLUSIONS: A pre-contoured plate anatomically configured to fit the clavicle was easier to apply. MIPO technique for midshaft clavicle fractures may be a good option...|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} fixator provides a mechanical {{connection between the}} bone fragments and recording devices or power systems. We have used this characteristic of external fixation since 1965 to record deformations occurring at the fracture site and to measure the mechanical characteristics of fracture healing in more than 500 patients. As in all <b>osteosyntheses,</b> the fixation <b>material</b> (here the external rod) resists the mechanical forces applied to the bone fragments. As healing progresses, the bone participates {{more and more in}} the weight bearing of the system and the rod deforms less. Seven types of deformation curves have been defined, characterizing seven different modes of healing: 1) normal healing, 2) slow healing, 3) delayed union, 4) arrest in evolution, 5) pseudarthrosis, 6) resorption of the callus, and 7) breakage of the callus.

40|$|Background: Extraarticular distal tibial {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most challenging fractures encountered by an orthopedician for treatment because of its subcutaneous location, poor blood supply and decreased muscular cover anteriorly, complications such as delayed union, nonunion, wound infection, and wound dehiscence are often seen as a great challenge to the surgeon. Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) and intramedullary interlocking nail (IMLN) are two well-accepted and effective methods, but each has been historically related to complications. This study compares clinical and radiological outcome in extraarticular distal tibia fractures treated by intramedullary interlocking nail (IMLN) and minimally invasive plate <b>osteosynthesis</b> (MIPO). <b>Materials</b> and Methods: 42 patients included in this study, 21 underwent IMLN and 21 were treated with MIPO who met the inclusion criteria and operated between June 2014 and May 2015. Patients were followed up for clinical and radiological evaluation. Results: In IMLN group, average union time was 18. 26 weeks compared to 21. 70 weeks in plating group which was significant (P < 0. 0001). Average time required for partial and full weight bearing in the nailing group was 4. 95 weeks and 10. 09 weeks respectively which was significantly less (P < 0. 0001) as compared to 6. 90 weeks and 13. 38 weeks in the plating group. Lesser complications in terms of implant irritation, ankle stiffness, and infection, were seen in interlocking group as compared to plating group. Average functional outcome according to American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score was measured which came out to be 96. 67. Conclusion: IMLN group was associated with lesser duration of surgery, earlier weight bearing and union rate, lesser incidence of infection and implant irritation which makes it a preferable choice for fixation of extra-articular distal tibial fractures. However, larger randomized controlled trials are required for confirming the results...|$|R
