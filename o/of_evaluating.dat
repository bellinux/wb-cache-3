The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E

The approach adopted in the paper is a quantitative technique based on use of mathematical modeling; the state evaluation is used for describing development state <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> objects from a view of integral, while the trend evaluation is used for describing development trend from a view of considering change speed <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> objects. On this basis, a dynamic comprehensive evaluation model is constructed, in which the state and the trend <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> objects are syncretized. Finally, a calculation example is pulled into to illustrate the feasibility and availability of dynamic comprehensive evaluation model from the empirical perspective...|$|R

5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric dating technique <b>of</b> <b>evaluating</b> a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{adequate}} staging {{and subsequent}} accurate estimation of prognosis, {{a sufficient number}} of lymph nodes (LNs) has to be evaluated. This study aimed to identify factors associated with adequate nodal evaluation and to determine its relationship with survival. METHODS: Data from all patients with stage I to III rectal carcinoma who underwent surgical treatment and who were diagnosed in the period 2000 to 2006 were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Multilevel logistic analysis was performed to examine the influence of relevant factors on the number <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> LNs. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the association with overall survival. RESULTS: The number <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> LNs was determined for 10, 788 (91 %) of 11, 818 tumors. Median number <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> LNs was 7, ranging from 4 to 11 between pathology laboratories. The proportion of patients with positive LNs increased with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> LNs. Men, younger patients, tumors with deeper invasion and nodal involvement, patients without preoperative radiotherapy who underwent a low anterior resection, and patients whose LNs were evaluated in an academic pathology laboratory {{were more likely to have}} >/= 12 LNs evaluated. After adding these factors to the model, unexplained variation between pathology laboratories and between hospitals remained. The overall survival increased with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>evaluated</b> LNs. CONCLUSIONS: A large variation in LN evaluation among patients with rectal cancer was revealed. Improvement in LN evaluation by both hospitals and pathology laboratories could improve staging, leading to more reliable estimation of prognosis...|$|R
