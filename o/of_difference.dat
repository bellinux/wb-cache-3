5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance <b>of</b> <b>difference.</b> Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology.

5|$|This was but {{one point}} <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between Oak Ridge {{residents}} {{and the rest}} of Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years.

5|$|In 1974 Klein {{studied the}} fossils of Hippotragus species in South Africa. Most {{of these were}} found to {{represent}} the bluebuck and the roan antelope. The fossil record suggested that the bluebuck occurred in large numbers during the last glacial period (nearly 0.1million years ago), and was more common than sympatric antelopes. The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the roan antelope, a notable point <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck {{have been found in}} the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Cave (near Plettenberg Bay) and Swartklip (to the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains). Faith et al. 2013 noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by biogeographical barriers, such as the Cape Fold Belt and afromontane forests. A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast). Thus, a mass extinction could have taken place, leaving behind mainly the populations that remained in the resource-rich western CFR. The causes of the drastic decline in bluebuck populations just before the 15th and 16th centuries have not been investigated; competition with livestock and habitat deterioration could have been major factors in its depletion.|$|E
5|$|In their 1995 {{review of}} Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues {{established}} Eptesicus somalicus malagasyensis, a new subspecies of Eptesicus somalicus (currently Neoromicia somalica). They {{had only a}} single specimen and noted that further material was needed to assess the new form's relationship with E.somalicus. Studies in 2001 and 2002 provided evidence that E.somalicus and related species are not closely related to Eptesicus (nor to Pipistrellus, where they have also been placed), so that these species were allocated to the separate genus Neoromicia. In 2004, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo reviewed the Malagasy subspecies after collecting two more specimens and concluded that it was distinct enough to be classified as a separate species, Neoromicia malagasyensis. Two years later, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on two more specimens and showed that the bacula (penis bones) of N.malagasyensis and N.somalica are different, providing further evidence that they are distinct species. However, they recommended that further research assess the degree <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between N.malagasyensis and N.matroka (formerly in Eptesicus, but placed in Neoromicia by Bates and colleagues), which occurs further east in Madagascar. The IUCN Red List currently again classifies the species in Eptesicus, as Eptesicus malagasyensis.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the older generation systems. The game allows for up to five times the number of on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, and spray graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

40|$|Model {{comparison}} {{includes three}} major concerns: presentation, calculation, and visualization <b>of</b> model <b>differences.</b> In this {{paper we address}} the concern of visualization <b>of</b> model <b>differences</b> {{in the context of}} model configuration management systems. Since models are considered the main artifacts in model configuration management systems, we require that the differences between models are represented by means <b>of</b> a <b>differences</b> model, which conforms to a differences metamodel. The traditional approaches to visualization <b>of</b> model <b>differences</b> based on a textual, tree-like, or even diagrammatic representation <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> do not scale well in the presence <b>of</b> large <b>differences</b> models. The cause for this is that it gets harder to comprehend the meaning <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> as the size <b>of</b> the <b>differences</b> models increase. We focus on this problem and propose a solution that extends and combines two existing approaches, namely polymetric views and a generic visualization framework for metamodel-based languages. Polymetric views offer good overview, zoom, and filtering capabilities. A visualization framework for metamodel-based languages is used to visualize differences details. By using the combination of these two approaches, it becomes easier to comprehend the meaning <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> even in large models. This paper describes both the details of our solution, and a generic tool that implements the described solution...|$|R
