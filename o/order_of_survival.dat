40|$|Four commercially {{available}} antibacterial products (two wipes and two sprays) were tested under laboratory conditions {{on a range}} of food contact surfaces (wood, glass, plastic, Microban® incorporated plastic). The products’ effectiveness at preventing cross-contamination of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and the influence of surface type and drying time were assessed. Survival of the bacterial culture (approximately 400 colonies per 8 cm 2) on the above preparation surfaces was determined using an in situ nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) method. In the absence of any antibacterial products, both bacteria survived up to 120 min on all test surfaces with glass and plastic showing no reduction in bacterial number. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> is: glass>plasticMicroban® incorporated plastic>wood (< 8 %). The length of drying time did not affect the survival of either bacterium on glass and plastic surfaces. On wood and Microban® incorporated plastic, E. coli appeared to be more sensitive to drying time than S. aureus. Only plastic appeared to affect the effectiveness of the antibacterial products, where the reduction in bacterial number was significantly lower than the other test surfaces (p< 0. 05). The overall results suggest the antibacterial products are effective in disinfecting food preparing surfaces, provided products instructions are carefully followed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original approach for jointly fitting survival times and classifying samples into subgroups. The Coxlogit {{model is a}} generalized linear model with {{a common set of}} selected features for both tasks.

The model is estimated by minimizing a regularized log-likelihood through a coordinate descent algorithm.

40|$|The Hollow Fiber Diffusion (HFD) {{system is}} a novel {{approach}} for the in situ study of the survival of bacteria and viruses in the aquatic environment. The HFD system employs a tangential flow, hollow fiber cartridge with a large area (7 × 103 cm 2) of exchange surfaces for diffusion. When compared with diffusion chambers, the HFD system responded significantly faster and more accurately to changes in pH, Eh, nutrient concentrations and {{to the presence of}} disinfectants in the external aqueous environment. The T&#x 90; diffusion of low molecular weight substrates was 0. 6 h for the HFD system but was 4. 2 h for the diffusion chamber. The rate of diffusion or equilibration could be further improved by increasing the flow rate through the HFD system or reducing the volume of the sample reservoir. The HFD system was compatible with all test bacteria and viruses {{with the possible exception of}} tailed coliphages. The inactivation of tailed phages by the HFD system can be reduced or eliminated using a slower flow rate or larger diameter hollow fibers. Tailed coliphage inactivation in the HFD system was not apparent in natural waters. Neither adsorption of microorganisms to the hollow fiber membrane surfaces nor colonization of those surfaces was found to be a significant problem during its use in natural waters. A protocol for the decontamination and reuse of the hollow fiber cartridges using hydrogen peroxide was developed and applied successfully. The results of trials of the HFD system at five field sites suggests that the HFD system permits "real-time" accommodation to changes in the physicochemical parameters of the external aqueous environment which can influence the survival of microorganisms. Differences in the survival of microorganisms in the HFD system and in batch samples were shown. The HFD system demonstrated regrowth of Escherichia coli in the Rideau River which is an eutrophic, temperate river. It also demonstrated a diurnal inactivation pattern for Enterococcus durans with the slower decay of E. durans numbers in the hours of darkness. For the other water sources tested (the Ottawa River, the Kennedy Burnett Stormwater Ponds, the Gombak River and the Kroh River), the general <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> of test microorganisms was MS- 2 coliphage > poliovirus > phage B > E. coli and E. durans. In the Rideau River, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> was E. coli > poliovirus > MS- 2 coliphage > E. durans. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the survival of microorganisms in the two equatorial rivers compared with the survival of the organisms in the oligotrophic, temperate Ottawa River. The HFD system will be very useful in studying the survival and natural ecology of microorganisms in the aquatic environment. It can be applied to model the behavior of water quality indicators, pathogenic organisms and genetically engineered microorganisms. It also has potential for ecotoxicological studies, monitoring for toxins or pollutants in the environment and for the in-line monitoring of the efficiency of water treatment processes such as chlorination...|$|E

The article analyzes the contested concept of global health {{through the lens of}} orders of worth. Drawing on pragmatist political and social theory, especially the work of Boltanski and Th 9 venot, I conceptualize orders of worth as moral narratives that connect visions of universal humankind to ideas about moral worth and deficiency. They thereby differ from the self/other narrative of political identity that is emphasized in International Relations scholarship. Orders of worth do not pitch a particularistic identity against foreign identities, but tie collective identity to a higher common good. They provide tools for moral evaluation and the justification of hierarchy. I use this heuristic to reconstruct four main conceptions of health in global politics: The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> the order of fairness, the order of production, and the order of spirit. Each of them articulates a distinct political identity, as 'we species', 'we liberals', 'we bodies' and 'we souls', and implies different notions of virtuous and selfish conduct in the global community. These orders are derived from scholarly writings and the policies of global health institutions. Finally, I discuss the nature of compromises between the four orders regarding contested issues such as health emergencies or digital medicine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{determining}} the priority of patients treatments called triage is used to direct rescue activities during a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI). In present disaster medicine, patients with the highest priority (with a red tag attached) are transported {{to the hospital in}} random order, although their expected probability <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> (Ps) may differ. Recently, an electronic triage tag (E-triage) that is able to sense the patient’s vital signs in real time has been developed. Moreover, based on the sensed vital signs, the physician’s remarks about the patient, and medical treatment statistics, each patient’s Ps can be estimated. In this paper, utilizing E-triage and the latest medical treatment statistics, we first formulate the problem of determining a transportation <b>order</b> <b>of</b> patients that maximizes the life-saving ratio, given the latest vital signs and temporal variation in the <b>survival</b> probability <b>of</b> each patient, the time for an ambulance to transport the patient to an appropriate hospital, and other factors. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on a greedy method that transports patients in the increasing <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their expected <b>survival</b> probability at the time they will arrive and be treated at the hospital. To prevent the case that rescuing a patient ear-lier results in the death of two or more patients, our proposed algorithm also considers, for each low survival probability patient, the two cases of rescuing the patient or not and derives the transportation order that keeps the most patients alive. Through simulations, we confirmed that the proposed method can transport about a 25 % larger number of patients to the hospital before their expected survival probability gets lower than a marginal probability than conventional methods.
