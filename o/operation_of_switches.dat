30|$|In this paper, the {{objective}} functions are considered {{so as to}} optimize the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>switches</b> and loading of feeders, laterals {{as well as on}} transformers and minimization of unbalanced loading index of feeders, laterals and transformer after switching operation. The constraints in the restoration process to be considered are: (a) maintain the radial structure of the network, (b) no overloaded equipment and (c) higher priority customers should always be supplied first. The result shows that inclusion of the transformer current limits has changed the ranking of plans. The system becomes more reliable with the minimization of unbalanced loading of transformer current as there is no scope for exceeding the limits during restoration plans. Feasible plans which consider more objective functions make the system more reliable. The reliability and stability of the restored network has increased by 1.09  %. The priority customers can be supplied first {{on the basis of the}} preference index plans during partial blackout or full blackout. The consumer loads which are not energized may be fed by the supporting feeders in the neighbourhood via on-off switches. The result shows that restoration process is done using minimum number of switching operations. Safety and operability of transformer, laterals and feeders is taken up by maintaining the line currents within the operational limits of power system components.|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{identified}} telerobotics and telescience as essential technologies {{to reduce the}} crew extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and intra-vehicular activity (IVA) workloads. Under this project, we are developing and flight testing a novel IVA robot to relieve the crew of tedious and routine tasks. Through ground telerobotic control of this robot, we will enable ground researchers to routinely interact with experiments in space. Our approach is to develop an IVA robot system incrementally by employing a series of flight tests with increasing complexity. This approach has the advantages of providing an early IVA capability that can assist the crew, demonstrate capabilities that ground researchers can be confident of in planning for future experiments, and allow incremental refinement of system capabilities and insertion of new technology. In parallel with this approach to flight testing, we seek to establish ground test beds, in which the requirements of payload experimenters can be further investigated. In 1993 we reviewed manifested SpaceHab experiments and defined IVA robot requirements to assist in their operation. We also examined previous IVA robot designs and assessed them against flight requirements. We rejected previous design concepts {{on the basis of}} threat to crew safety, operability, and maintainability.

The model <b>of</b> motoring <b>operation</b> under the current hysteresis control is developed to investigate {{the effects of the}} turn-on angle, the turn-off angle, and the current reference on these criteria.

The simulated results show that the turn-on angle and the turn-off angles have considerable effects on motoring <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>switched</b> reluctance drives. The optimal turn-on angle and the optimal turn-off angle can be optimized in order to maximum the average torque, the average torque per rms current, or the torque smoothness factor.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to present an approach to decision making {{in the operation of}} electrical power systems that will use a simple genetic algorithm as a teacher for the process of supervised learning of a feedforward, backpropagation artificial neural network. The fitness function used in the genetic algorithms is based on a load flow program and used to determine the optimal condition of the critical switches of the system. Reward and penalty functions are applied to it in order to emphasize environmental, economic, security, robustness, public policy and other considerations as they are pre-determined by the philosophy of operation of the utility.
