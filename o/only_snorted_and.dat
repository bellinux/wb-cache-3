6000|$|The Colonel <b>only</b> <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> answered--"You'd better tuck the {{men into}} their cots, then, {{and see that}} they don't wake up and cry in the night" [...] The Sergeant withdrew.|$|E
60|$|The amazement, half sorrowful, half reproachful, on the man's {{face was}} {{perfectly}} done. But Trent <b>only</b> <b>snorted.</b>|$|R
60|$|No wonder, then, that at {{the mere}} mention of Sharp's name Mrs. Black shook her head sorrowfully, Bruce the {{blacksmith}} frowned darkly, and Quentin Dick not <b>only</b> frowned but <b>snorted</b> vehemently, <b>and</b> smote the table with such violence that the startled pussie fled from the scene in dismay.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a <b>snorting</b> <b>and</b> {{stamping}} of {{the horses}} startled the men.|$|R

50|$|Courtship {{behaviors}} before mating include <b>snorting</b> <b>and</b> sparring {{with the}} horns among males. Another courtship behavior is called bluff and bluster, where the rhino will <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> swing its {{head from side}} to side aggressively before running away repeatedly. Breeding pairs stay together for 2-3 days and sometimes even weeks. They mate several times a day over this time and copulation lasts for a half-hour.|$|R
60|$|When she {{finished}} reading aloud a few paragraphs the old cattleman <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> his face grew redder.|$|R
40|$|Given {{competing}} claims, {{an objective}} head-to-head {{comparison of the}} performance of both <b>Snort</b> R <b>and</b> Suricata Intrusion Detection Systems is important. In this paper, we present a thorough, repeatable, quantitative, apples-to-apples comparison {{of the performance of}} <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> Suricata. We compare both the default, “out of the box ” performance of both systems and investigate alternative configurations such as multi-instance <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> improvements to Suricata that were inspired by our initial results; changes to Suricata inspired by our testing resulted in performance improvements of up to 20 X. We examine the performance of both systems as we scale system resources such as the number of CPU cores. We vary both the rulesets used and the workloads processed. Our results show that a single instance of Suricata is able to deliver substantially higher performance than a corresponding single instance of <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> higher performance than multi-instance Snort as well...|$|R
60|$|Ruefully, his lordship {{produced}} {{his little}} all. Sir Thomas took {{it with a}} <b>snort,</b> <b>and</b> went to the door.|$|R
60|$|The little mare was {{thoroughly}} frightened, <b>and</b> giving a <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> a plunge she threw both rider and wildcat to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Fred had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when both}} horses began to <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> stamp their feet as if wanting {{to turn and}} run away.|$|R
6000|$|This quaint {{suggestion}} startled Trot and {{she looked}} gravely at the speaker while she considered it, but Cap'n Bill gave a scornful <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> asked: ...|$|R
60|$|He was too late. It fell to {{the ground}} and bounded away, with its {{proprietor}} in passionate chase. Arthur <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> gently chafed his knuckles.|$|R
60|$|Charley {{acted upon}} the advice, {{which had the}} effect of making the horse shake his head with a sharp <b>snort,</b> <b>and</b> back more vigorously than ever.|$|R
60|$|Two cowboys were in {{the corral}} with a saddled mustang. One of them carried a canvas sack {{containing}} tools and horseshoes. As he dropped it with a metallic clink the mustang <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> jumped and rolled the whites of his eyes. He knew what that clink meant.|$|R
50|$|In Berkeley Breathed's {{comic strip}} Bloom County, the {{character}} Bill the Cat {{was described as}} being addicted to getting high from <b>snorting</b> <b>and</b> free basing Tender Vittles.|$|R
5000|$|... "Major Boobage": Kids {{across the}} nation, {{particularly}} Kenny, {{have found a}} new way to get high. The episode references the glue-sniffing, paint <b>snorting,</b> <b>and</b> marker sniffing epidemics.|$|R
60|$|I <b>snorted,</b> <b>and</b> he laughed, {{and the old}} sow grunted with contempt, and {{her little}} eyes twisted towards us with a demoniac leer as she rolled past.|$|R
60|$|The Sawhorse gave {{an angry}} <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> stamped his golden feet. The Tiger {{crouched}} and growled. Slowly the great Lion {{rose to his}} feet, his mane bristling.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Jane gave a scornful <b>snort,</b> <b>and</b> the man {{responded in}} a curious way. He winked slowly and laboriously, still {{retaining}} the solemn expression on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{a sudden}} big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze; and the Champion Faster gives a <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> gallops off in the dark toward fodder.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the horse}} grew restless and pricked its ears, stood still <b>snorting,</b> <b>and</b> backed {{away to the}} length of its tether as a face looked out from the undergrowth. The sinking light of the fire was on it, and it was an evil face with the stamp of hunger on it, and malevolence in the staring eyes. Again the horse <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> trembled as an arm was thrust out of the bushes and {{something}} glinted in the hand, but Alton still lay motionless with the pack saddle under his shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{want to hear}} {{something}} more than a <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> a shout from our brother here. We heard them Friday night, and we've been talkin' about it ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll 'ave the 'ole church {{picked to}} pieces at this rate,' said the clerk. 'You shouldn't 'ave done it, {{and it was}} very wrong.' He <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|He led her outside. Madeline {{heard the}} horse <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> champ his bit. The cowboy spoke low; {{only a few}} words were intelligible--"stirrups... wait... out of town... mountain... trail ... now ride!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall be}} enlightened {{if you will}} do as I request," [...] Wilding insisted, and Vallancey, with a lift of the brows, a <b>snort,</b> <b>and</b> a shrug, turned away to comply.|$|R
60|$|Jellicoe was {{apparently}} not in conversational mood. He uttered no word for quite three minutes. At {{the end of}} which time he gave a sound midway between a <b>snort</b> <b>and</b> a sigh.|$|R
60|$|The <b>snorts</b> <b>and</b> snarls that {{escaped from}} {{him for the}} next {{quarter of an hour}} went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade never agree.|$|R
60|$|The two wolves ran, ladies'-chain fashion, {{in and out}} of the herd, which <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> {{threw up}} its head, and {{separated}} into two clumps. In one, the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have divided the herd so neatly.|$|R
6000|$|When the cheque {{was drawn}} out and duly signed, Mrs Gaff {{went to the}} rails and shook it as she might have shaken {{in the face of}} her enemies the flag under which she meant to conquer or to die. On {{receiving}} it back she returned and presented it to the elderly teller with a look that said plainly--"There! refuse to cash that at your peril;" [...] but she said nothing, she <b>only</b> <b>snorted.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Del <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> flung {{himself down}} on the {{opposite}} bunk. [...] "Think yer funny, don't you?" [...] No answer forthcoming, he deemed the retort conclusive, rolled over, and fell to studying the moss chinks.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} him a gay old blossom," [...] said the other. [...] "When he has chased you round his room, and has blown sparks at you, <b>and</b> has <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> howled, and cracked his tail, and snapped his jaws {{like a pair}} of anvils, your {{energies}} will be toned up higher than ever before in your life." ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{thriving}} {{technology and}} the great increase in the usage of computer networks, {{the risk of having}} these network to be under attacks have been increased. Number of techniques have been created and designed to help in detecting and/or preventing such attacks. One common technique is the use of Network Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems NIDS. Today, number of open sources and commercial Intrusion Detection Systems are available to match enterprises requirements but the performance of these Intrusion Detection Systems is still the main concern. In this paper, we have tested and analyzed the performance of the well know IDS system <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> the new coming IDS system Suricata. Both <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> Suricata were implemented on three different platforms (ESXi virtual server, Linux 2. 6 and FreeBSD) to simulate a real environment. Finally, in our results and analysis a comparison of the performance of the two IDS systems is provided along with some recommendations as to what and when will be the ideal environment for <b>Snort</b> <b>and</b> Suricata...|$|R
60|$|By {{and by a}} {{plume of}} smoke rose above the trees and {{something}} twinkled in an opening. A rhythmic <b>snorting</b> <b>and</b> a rumble pierced the throb of the river, and Kerr looked up the track.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{ran toward}} his horse. But as the {{mountain}} lion gave another growl, the horse <b>snorted</b> <b>and</b> plunged, in sudden fright. Then the steed took to his heels and went clattering along the rocky defile.|$|R
