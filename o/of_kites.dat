It is often found in the company <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
5|$|Kite: As {{written in}} the Mozi, the Zhou Dynasty philosopher, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer Lu Ban (fl. 5th century BC) from the State of Lu created a wooden bird that remained flying {{in the air for}} three days, essentially a kite; there is written evidence that kites were used as rescue signals when the city of Nanjing was besieged by Hou Jing (died 552) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), while similar accounts <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> used for military signalling are found in the Tang (618–907) and Jin (1115–1234) dynasties; kite flying as a pastime can be seen in painted murals of Dunhuang dating to the Northern Wei (386–534) period, while descriptions of flying kites as a pastime have been found in Song (960–1279) and Ming (1368–1644) texts.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} at the Institute, Wittgenstein {{developed}} an interest in aeronautics. He arrived at the Victoria University of Manchester {{in the spring of}} 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near Glossop. Specifically, the Royal Meteorological Society researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir Arthur Schuster.|$|E
25|$|William Turner's Historia Avium ("History of Birds"), {{published}} at Cologne in 1544, was {{an early}} ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> in English cities where they snatched food {{out of the hands}} of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the osprey emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times that he lived in and stands in contrast to later works such as Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne that were written in a tranquil era.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} why Cody became fascinated by kite flying. Cody liked to recount a tale that he first became {{inspired}} by a Chinese cook; who, apparently, taught him to fly kites, whilst travelling along the old cattle trail. However, {{it is more likely}} that Cody's interest in kites was kindled by his friendship with Auguste Gaudron, a balloonist Cody met while performing at Alexandra Palace. Cody showed an early interest in the creation <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> capable of flying to high altitudes and of carrying a man. Leon also became interested, and the two of them competed to make the largest kites capable of flying at ever-increasing heights. Vivian too became involved after a great deal of experimentation.|$|E

500|$|There was {{government}} funding provided of $9,000 then {{with support from}} Senators Charles B. Farwell and Leland Stanford for a full-scale test experiment in northern Texas. There was to be completed a scientific analysis of the results. The man-made rain project was to take place {{near the town of}} Midland. The equipment involved in this test was 100 [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloons, dozens <b>of</b> <b>kites</b> six to twelve feet high, miles of copper wire, nitroglycerine, dynamite, and gunpowder. Myers provided all the balloons and the gases. Electric batteries and generators were also part of the on-site equipment. The design of the rain experiment project was to have explosions stir up particle aggregation. Myers' balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were the start of many such explosions that were to take place in the rain producing experiment. His balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were one part oxygen gas combined with two parts of hydrogen gas, which would make a huge explosion upon detonation. The side effect of this balloon explosion was that water was produced. This water would drop from the sky at some high altitude and the idea was that all of this action would stimulate the atmosphere to make rain. The balloons made by Myers for the government at his [...] "balloon farm" [...] would hold 500 to 5000 cubic feet of gas. Myers had complete charge of the government rain producing experiments for years.|$|E
