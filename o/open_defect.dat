40|$|Open defects are {{extremely}} common in CMOS circuits. They {{can either be}} a partial or complete breaking of an input line. The complete breaking of the line {{is referred to as}} strong or full <b>open</b> <b>defect.</b> Until few years ago, a full <b>open</b> <b>defect</b> on any interconnecting line has been considered as floating. In nanometric CMOS technology, in which gate leakage currents are not negligible, full <b>open</b> <b>defect</b> lines cannot be considered to be electrically isolated. The final value of the node is independent of the initial state of the node and totally depends on the topological characteristics of the gate. Experimental evidence of the behavior of all basic gates at 90 nm, 64 nm and 32 nm is provided; this shows a decrease in the drain current to gate leakage current ratio, in the technology scaling. The effect of full opens at the gates has also been tested by varying the PVT conditions. These variations provide a range of variation for the full open input voltage and gate leakage current. The effect of full opens on various circuits like the full adder has also been documented at various nanometric levels. 1...|$|E

The defective line is first classified as fully opened {{by means of a}} logic-based diagnosis tool (Faloc). The proposal is based on the division of the defective line into a number of segments.

40|$|Abstract—An Interconnect full <b>open</b> <b>defect</b> {{breaks the}} connec-tion between {{the driver and}} the gate {{terminals}} of downstream tran-sistors, generating a floating line. The behavior of floating lines is known to depend on several factors, namely parasitic capacitances to neighboring structures, transistor capacitances of downstream gate(s) and trapped charges. For nanometer CMOS technologies, the reduction of oxide thickness leads to {{a significant increase in}} gate tunneling leakage. This new phenomenon influences the be-havior of circuits with interconnect full open defects. Floating lines can no longer be considered electrically isolated and are subjected to transient evolutions, reaching a steady state determined by the technology, downstream interconnect and gate(s) topology. The oc-currence of such defects and the impact of gate tunneling leakage are expected to increase in the future. In this work, interconnect full open defects affecting nanometer CMOS technologies are an-alyzed and the defective logic response of downstream gates after reaching the steady state is predicted. Experimental evidence of this behavior is presented for circuits belonging to a 180 nm and a 65 nm CMOS technologies.

40|$|Increasing {{integration}} and complexity in IC design provides challenges for manufacturing testing. This thesis studies how process and supply voltage variation in uence defect behaviour {{to determine the}} impact on manufacturing test cost and quality. The focus is on logic testing of static CMOS designs with respect to two important defect types in deep submicron CMOS: resistive bridges and full opens. The {{first part of the}} thesis addresses testing for resistive bridge defects in designs with multiple supply voltage settings. To enable analysis, a fault simulator is developed using a supply voltage-aware model for bridge defect behaviour. The analysis shows that for high defect coverage it is necessary to perform test for more than one supply voltage setting, due to supply voltage-dependent behaviour. A low-cost and effective test method is presented consisting of multi-voltage test generation that achieves high defect coverage and test set size reduction without compromise to defect coverage. Experiments on synthesised benchmarks with realistic bridge locations validate the proposed method. The second part focuses on the behaviour of full <b>open</b> <b>defects</b> under supply voltage variation. The aim is to determine the appropriate value of supply voltage to use when testing. Two models are considered for the behaviour of full <b>open</b> <b>defects</b> with and without gate tunnelling leakage influence. Analysis of the supply voltage-dependent behaviour of full <b>open</b> <b>defects</b> is performed to determine if it is required to test using more than one supply voltage to detect all full <b>open</b> <b>defects.</b> Experiments on synthesised benchmarks using an extended version of the fault simulator tool mentioned above, measure the quantitative impact of supply voltage variation on defect coverage. The final part studies the impact of process variation on the behaviour of bridge defects. Detailed analysis using synthesised ISCAS benchmarks and realistic bridge model shows that process variation leads to additional faults. If process variation is not considered in test generation, the test will fail to detect some of these faults, which leads to test escapes. A novel metric to quantify the impact of process variation on test quality is employed {{in the development of a}} new test generation tool, which achieves high bridge defect coverage.

40|$|Semiconductor {{memories}} most specifically SRAMs {{are becoming}} {{very popular in}} today’s System-On-Chip(SOCs). As technology shrinks and the share of memories in these complex systems increases, memories become more susceptible to faults. One {{of the most important}} faults in SRAMs is Data Retention Fault (DRF). DRF is a fault which occurs as a results of an (partial) open in the Vdd path of the cell. This <b>open</b> <b>defect</b> causes the memory cell to be unable to keep its logic value after a certain time interval. Testing memories for these defects has therefore become a major issue to test engineers as they try to reduce the long test time. One of the ways of reducing this test time is by CE-MS- 2009 - 17 use of Design-For-Testability (DFT) techniques. DFTs are specialised additional hardware which are added to integrated circuits to make them testable. In DFT, the emphasis is not on the test itself but on the design. The question asked is always: ”How can circuits in general or memories in particular be designed to make them testable”? Many DFT’s have been proposed in the past for the detection of DRFs. These DFTs techniques are said to reduce this test time. Limited experimental data has been presented to proof the efficiency of these DFTs, thus qualifying them as better test methods over traditional functional test.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients born with a cardiac septal defect, by assessing its prevalence and its relation with patient characteristics and outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the database of the Euro Heart Survey on adult congenital heart disease (a retrospective cohort study with a 5 -year follow-up), the relevant data on all 1877 patients with an atrial septal defect (ASD), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a cyanotic defect were analysed. Most patients (83 %) attended a specialised centre. There were 896 patients with an ASD (377 closed, 504 open without and 15 with Eisenmenger's syndrome), 710 with a VSD (275, 352 and 83, respectively), 133 with Eisenmenger's syndrome owing to another defect and 138 remaining patients with cyanosis. PAH was present in 531 (28 %) patients, or in 34 % of patients with an open ASD and 28 % of patients with an open VSD, and 12 % and 13 % of patients with a closed defect, respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome (20. 6 %). In case of an <b>open</b> <b>defect,</b> PAH entailed an eightfold increased probability of functional limitations (New York Heart Association class > 1), with a further sixfold increase when Eisenmenger's syndrome was present. Also, in patients with persisting PAH despite defect closure, functional limitations were more common. In patients with ASD, the prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction increased with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (OR = 1. 073 per mm Hg; p < 0. 001). Major bleeding events were more prevalent in patients with cyanosis with than without Eisenmenger's syndrome (17 % vs 3 %; p < 0. 001).
