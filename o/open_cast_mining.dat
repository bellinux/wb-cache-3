25|$|Most open cast {{mines in}} the United States extract {{bituminous}} coal. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> {{is used for}} both thermal and metallurgical coals. In New South Wales open casting for steam coal and anthracite is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.|$|E
25|$|Tin is smelted from cassiterite, {{a mineral}} found in {{hydrothermal}} veins in granite, and the uplands of Dartmoor, in Devon, England, were a particularly productive area. The techniques {{used for the}} extraction of tin from Dartmoor followed a progression from streaming through <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> to underground mining. Today, there are extensive archaeological remains of these three phases of the industry, {{as well as of}} the several stages of processing that were necessary to convert the ore to tin metal.|$|E

25|$|The Hatherton Canal is a {{derelict}} {{branch of}} the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal in south Staffordshire, England. It was constructed in two phases, the first section opening in 1841 and connecting the main line to Churchbridge, from where a tramway connected to the Great Wyrley coal mines. The second section was {{a joint venture with}} the Birmingham Canal Navigations, and linked Churchbridge to the Cannock Extension Canal by a flight of 13 locks, which were opened with the Extension Canal in 1863. The coal traffic was very profitable, and the canal remained in use until 1949. It was formally abandoned in 1955, after which the Churchbridge flight and much of the Extension Canal were destroyed by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{continues}} {{to the east}} of Eckington and the west of Killamarsh, to arrive at the Rother Valley Country Park, where the course is largely man-made, as the park is part of a flood-defence scheme. The river was diverted to run close to the railway to the west while 1.7 million tonnes of coal from the reserves under the park were removed by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> between 1976 and 1981. The channel was then rebuilt once mining had ceased and the pit had been filled in. The visitor centre uses a part of Bedgrave Mill, which was constructed around 1100, {{and is one of the}} first mills known to have been built on the River Don and its tributaries. Continuing northwards, the river passes through the Sheffield districts of Beighton and Woodhouse, followed by the Rotherham districts of Catcliffe and Treeton, flowing on to its confluence with the River Don at Ickles, Rotherham.|$|E
25|$|Kulpahar region {{comprises}} areas {{which are}} essentially covered by grey, pink, red granitic rock and black dolerite. The rocks are generally medium to coarse to very coarse grained, having variegated colours with varying textural patterns. In geological nomenclature {{they can be}} classified {{on the basis of}} colour, grain size and texture. Over half of the areas identified so far appear suitable for extracting blocks of two cubic meters in size from the surface outcrops. The granite with red feldspar having presence of white and bluish quartz has caught the fancy of buyers and has become quite popular in national and international markets during the last 10 years, The remaining outcrops would be suited for blocks of smaller size. Ruby red granite is good in quality and is very popular in national and international markets, In granitic terrain the rocks may occur in the form of widespread sheets exposed above the ground level, in the form of hillocks, as high ground or below the ground under soil cover. They may also occur as boulders of different size and shapes spread over the sheet rock. They may be found as dykes, particularly of black and green types, as long narrow ridges often concealed beneath the surface. A major part of granite deposits in these regions are underground and have to be extracted by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining.</b> Underground granite block is more compact and require sophisticated and specialised machinery which adds to the cost of mining.|$|E

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{coal measures}} throughout the parish were a valuable source of fuel. Radcliffe already had an established textile industry {{before the arrival}} of steam power. The first recorded instance of coal getting in the North West of England was in 1246, when Adam de Radeclyve was fined for digging de minera on common land in the Radcliffe area. Coal outcroppings were not uncommon; as recently as 1936 members of the public were seen carrying away large pieces of coal from a seam revealed by the landslip caused when the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal breached at Ladyshore. Mining was initially limited to bell pits until the arrival of steam engines, which along with improved ventilation, made possible much deeper pits. The earliest known local use of such an engine was in 1792 at Black Cat Colliery. The parish of Radcliffe was once home to as many as 50pits, but with the exceptions of Outwood Colliery and Ladyshore Colliery, all were either exhausted or closed {{by the end of the}} 19th century. [...] During the 1926 General Strike many striking miners illegally took coal from exposed seams around the Coney Green area of the town, to sell to local housewives. In the 1950s to the north of the town the National Coal Board did some <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> near Radcliffe Moor Road, but the last legal instance of coal mining in Radcliffe was between 1931 and 1949, close to Bury and Bolton Road.|$|E
2500|$|From 1981 to 2002, 15,000 jobs in {{the coal}} {{industry}} disappeared {{and not a single}} colliery remains open, although <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> took place at Arkwright Town for a few years from November 1993. Many of the sites were restored by contractor Killingleys for Derbyshire County Council. Very little evidence of the mining industry remains today; a cyclist and walkers route, the [...] "Five Pits Trail" [...] now links some of the former collieries and most of the sites are now indistinguishable from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
2500|$|Following the [...] {{closure of}} the pits there were {{large areas of the}} {{district}} left derelict, with old mine workings and spoil tips from the last 150 years of industrialisation. Over the last few years these sites have been re mediated and regenerated by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> the remaining surface deposits and reclamation of coal from the old spoil heaps. The sites have then being restored as a mix of parkland, business parks and housing sites. A lot of the work being part funded by EEC Coalfield community regeneration grants, to provide money to help clean up the environmental legacy and fund the creation of job opportunities by providing the infrastructure for developments. This has resulted in several large and some smaller business parks, now providing jobs for thousands of people. But not of the same skill level of the old engineering jobs lost. A lot being warehousing and distribution, as opposed to the old engineering trades.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1946, on {{the orders}} of Manny Shinwell (the then Labour Party's Minister of Fuel and Power) a [...] "column of lorries and heavy plant machinery" [...] arrived at Wentworth. The {{objective}} was the mining of {{a large part of}} the estate close to the house for coal. This was an area where the prolific Barnsley seam was within [...] of the surface and the area between the house and the Rockingham Mausoleum became the largest <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> site in Britain at that time: 132,000 tons of coal were removed solely from the gardens. Ostensibly the coal was desperately needed in Britain's austere post-war economy to fuel the railways, but the decision has been widely seen as useful cover for an act of class-war spite against the coal-owning aristocracy. A survey by Sheffield University, commissioned by Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, the 8th Earl, found the coal to be [...] "very poor stuff" [...] and [...] "not worth the getting"; this contrasted with Shinwell's assertion that it was [...] "exceptionally good-quality." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Act criminalised {{unauthorised}} alterations, or demolitions, to a listed building, so {{in theory}} at least, all historic buildings were now safe from unauthorised demolition. The {{truth was that}} the Act was rarely enforced, only a few buildings were listed, over half of them by just one council, Winchelsea. Elsewhere, the fines levied on those failing {{to comply with the}} Act were far less than the profit from redeveloping a site. Little changed. In 1946, in what has been described as [...] "an act of sheer class-war vindictiveness", Britain's Labour Government insisted on the destruction, by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining,</b> of the park and formal gardens of Wentworth Woodhouse, Britain's largest country house. [...] The Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell, insisted, as 300-year-old oaks were uprooted, that [...] "the park be mined right up to the mansion's door." [...] Meanwhile, plans by the socialist government to wrest the house from its owner, the Earl Fitzwilliam, and convert the architecturally important house for [...] "homeless industrial families" [...] were only abandoned at the eleventh hour when Earl Fitzwilliam, through the auspices of his socialist sister, agreed to its conversion to a college—a lesser fate. This was the political climate in which many families abandoned the houses their families had owned for generations.|$|E
2500|$|Browtowe Council are {{helped by}} several organisations in the {{management}} of the canal, including Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, The British Trust for Nature Conservation Volunteers, the Countryside Agency, Nottinghamshire County Council and Awsworth Angling Club. Because of the rich habitat that the route provides, it was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 1993. Sections of wetland habitat and open water have been created by dredging, but {{a major part of the}} council's task has been to provide alternative supplies of water, since the Eastwood section is cut off from the Langley Mill basin and the original water supply from Moorgreen Reservoir by an infilled section, and there is a [...] gap caused by <b>open</b> <b>cast</b> <b>mining</b> between Eastwood and Awsworth, which has destroyed the link with the water supply from Giltbrook. The need to dispose of rainwater when the Awsworth Bypass was built in 1995 provided one new source, and in 1998, an electric pump was installed to pump water from the River Erewash into the canal. Further development of the canal as an amenity took place in 1998, when the towpath and a number of bridleways connecting to the towpath were given public right of way status. The canal is well-used, by walkers, cyclists, and naturalists, with some sections available to anglers and horse riders. Nottinghamshire County Council have assisted with upgrading the towpath to provide disability access where possible.|$|E
