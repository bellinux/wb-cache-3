5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his {{future in the}} Harrison-dominated western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success {{in the eastern part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> opposed slavery and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory. Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E

5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E
