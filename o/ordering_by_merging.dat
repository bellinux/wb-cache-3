50|$|On 28 July 1809, Strolz {{commanded}} a cavalry brigade in Christophe Antoine Merlin's Light Cavalry Division. The division was only formed on 25 July 1808 on the king's <b>orders</b> <b>by</b> <b>merging</b> most of IV Corps' cavalry assets with I Corps' cavalry, this to reinforce I Corps {{at the head}} of the Army's column. Strolz' troops are the 10th Regiment de Chasseurs à Cheval led by Colonel Jacques-Gervais de Subervie and the 26th Regiment de Chasseurs à Cheval led by Colonel Jacques-Laurent-Louis-Augustin Baron Vial. Together with Colonel Francois Léon Ormancey's Brigade consisting of the Polish Vistula Lancers Regiment (Regiment de Lanciers Polonais de la Vistule) and the Westphalian Light Cavalry Regiment (Regiment de Chevaux-Légers de Westphalie) they succeeded in encircling the British 23rd Light Dragoons, thus being responsible for one of the few French successes during this battle of Talavera.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGiven a set E, the {{partitions}} of E {{are usually}} <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> <b>merging</b> of classes. In segmentation procedures, this ordering often generates small parasite classes. A new ordering, called "grain building ordering", or GBO, is proposed. It requires a connection over E and states that A 4 B, with A,B ⊆ E, when each connected component of B contains a connected component of A. TheGBO applies to sets, partitions, and numerical functions. Thickenings {{with respect to}} the GBO are introduced as extensive idempotent operators that do not create connected components. The composition product of a connected opening by a thickening is still a thickening. Moreover, when {i, i ∈ I} is a granulometric family, then the two sequences { i, i ∈ I} and { i, i ∈ I}generate hierarchies, from which semi-groups can be derived. In addition,the approach allows us to combine any set of partitions or of tessellations into a synthetic one...|$|R
40|$|Question {{answering}} systems answer correctly to different questions {{because they are}} based on different strategies. In order {{to increase the number of}} questions which can be answered by a single process, we propose solutions to combine two question {{answering systems}}, QAVAL and RITEL. QAVAL proceeds by selecting short passages, annotates them by question terms, and then extracts from them answers which are <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> a machine learning validation process. RITEL develops a multi-level analysis of questions and documents. Answers are extracted and ordered according to two strategies: by exploiting the redundancy of candidates and a Bayesian model. In order to merge the system results, we developed different methods either <b>by</b> <b>merging</b> passages before answer <b>ordering,</b> or <b>by</b> <b>merging</b> end-results. The fusion of endresults is realized <b>by</b> voting, <b>merging,</b> and <b>by</b> a machine learning process on answer characteristics, which lead to an improvement of the best system results of 19 %. ...|$|R

50|$|From 1915 to 1970 the American Federation of Musicians Local 535 {{was the top}} black musicians' {{union in}} the country, with local and {{national}} musicians such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. Its offices were originally above Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe (whose walls are lined with photographs of the jazz stars who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. In 1970 it and the white union (Local 9) were <b>ordered</b> to <b>merge</b> <b>by</b> the courts (Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535) {{and most of the}} black musicians left.|$|R
40|$|Multimedia {{uploaded}} {{content is}} tagged and recommended by users of collaborative systems, resulting in informal classifications {{also known as}} folksonomies. Faceted web ranking has been proved a reasonable alternative to a single ranking which {{does not take into}} account a personalized context. In this paper we analyze the online computation of rankings of users associated to facets made up of multiple tags. Possible applications are user reputation evaluation (egoranking) and improvement of content quality in case of retrieval. We propose a solution based on PageRank as centrality measure: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of the corresponding tag-dependent subgraph; (ii) a faceted <b>order</b> is generated <b>by</b> <b>merging</b> rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. The fundamental assumption, validated by empirical observations, is that step (i) is scalable. We also present algorithms for part (ii) having time complexity O(k), where k is the number of tags in the facet, well suited to online computation...|$|R
