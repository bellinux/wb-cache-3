40|$|HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins (Env) are {{the only}} viral antigens present on the virus surface and serve as the key targets for virus-neutralizing antibodies.

40|$|Hyper-IgD and {{periodic}} fever syndrome (HIDS) and mevalonic aciduria (MA) are two {{autosomal recessive}} disorders that both {{are caused by}} a deficient activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme mevalonate kinase (MK) due to mutations in the encoding gene (MVK). The most frequently occurring MVK mutation, <b>V</b> 377 <b>I</b> (1129 G>A), has been identified exclusively in HIDS patients. Other common mutations {{have been associated with}} both HIDS and MA. To estimate <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> MK deficiency in the Netherlands, we determined <b>the</b> carrier frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 377 <b>I</b> mutation in genomic DNA extracted from anonymised newborn screening cards by PCR-RFLP. We found 14 carriers among 2138 analysed samples (1 : 153). Based on <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 377 <b>I</b> allele frequency of 42 % in patients diagnosed with MK deficiency, <b>the</b> carrier frequency <b>of</b> any MVK mutation in the Dutch population can be calculated as 1 : 65. This predicts a disease incidence between 1 in 5196 and 1 in 53 656, which is far more than actually observed.

The results obtained indicate that for 6. 24 % and 5. 58 % content of the 3 rd and the 5 th harmonic component, respectively embedded in the applied voltage stress, the {{probability of}} reduced time to failure or accelerated degradation is found to be 58. 93 %, and the mean life reduction obtained is just above 40 %.

After the optimization of the cavity dimension and laser fluence, significant enhancement factors of 4. 2, 3. 1, and 2. 87 in the emission intensity of V, Cr, and Mn lines, respectively, were achieved at a laser fluence of 42. 9 J/cm 2 using a hemispherical cavity (diameter: 5 mm).

This work was conducted independently of the recent studies of neutral vanadium lifetimes and oscillator strengths carried out by Den Hartog et al. and Lawler et al., and thus serves as a means to verify those measurements. Where our data overlap with their data, we generally find extremely good agreement in both level lifetimes and oscillator strengths. However, we also find evidence that Lawler et al. have systematically underestimated oscillator strengths for lines in the region of 9000 ± 100 Å.
