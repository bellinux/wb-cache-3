500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|To help {{illustrate}} the care {{that must be}} taken in teaching children and to emphasise the necessity of properly directing and managing their attentiveness, Maria Edgeworth drew several comparisons with non-European peoples. In her 1798 book Practical Education she maintained that unnecessarily causing fatigue should be a great concern of educators. In making the point that any mode of instruction that tired the attention was hurtful to children, her reasoning was that people can pay attention only to <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and because children can appear resistant to repetition, teachers naturally should vary things. However, educators should always be mindful of the fact that, [...] "while variety relieves the mind, the objects which are varied must not all be entirely new, for novelty and variety when joined, fatigue the mind" [...] as Edgeworth states. The teaching of children needed to follow carefully considered methods, needed to evidence concern for appropriateness and proper sequencing, {{and needed to be}} guided by consideration from forms of teaching that would be empowering and enabling, not fatiguing or disabling. In Edgeworth's work, the attention of the child appears as a key site for pedagogical work and interventions.|$|E

2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, I do it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E

Because the jobs were simple and repetitive, he could employ farmers, immigrants, and others who previously had done only manual labor. The five-dollar day gave them the income they needed to afford a home and support a family-and to buy the cars they were making. In creating a huge body of people who shared not only their work but many social and economic interests, Ford, to his lasting regret, spurred the development of industrial labor unions (Stewart et al. 1999).|$|R
5000|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling {{is handled}} by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.

The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build <b>things</b> <b>one</b> layer <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, depositing a string roughly {{the width of the}} extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.|$|R

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{consider that}} logocentrism {{may not be}} something which exists across all cultures, but instead has a particular bias in Western culture. Tedlock’s study of stories in the Quiché Maya culture leads him {{to suggest that the}} development of alphabetic writing systems may have led to a logocentric perspective, {{but this is not the}} case in all writing systems, and particularly less prevalent in cultures where writing has not been established. Tedlock writes, “The voice is linear, in Derrida’s view; there is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> happening <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, a sequence of phonemes,” and this is reflected in writing and even the study of language in the field of linguistics and what Tedlock calls “mythologics (or larger-scale structuralism)”, “are founded not upon a multidimensional apprehension of the multidimensional voice, but upon unilinear writing of the smallest-scale articulations within the voice.” This one dimensionality of writing means that only words can be represented through alphabetic writing, and, more often than not, tone, voice, accent and style are difficult if not impossible to represent. Geaney, in writing about ming (names) in early Chinese reveals that ideographic writing systems present some difficulty for the idea of logocentrism, and that even Derrida wrote of Chinese writing in an ambivalent way, assuming firstly that “writing has a historical telos in which phonetic writing is the normal ‘outcome’”, but also “speculating without irony about Chinese writing as a ‘movement of civilization outside all logocentrism’”.|$|R

40|$|Stress is {{a natural}} part of life. However, there are some {{demographics}} which experience stress at heightened levels due to their circumstances, making them more prone to negative consequences. One such demographic is emerging adult undergraduate student parents (EAUSPs). Research on highly stressed demographics allows for the creation of programs and strategies to aid them. Unfortunately, research on EAUSPs is very scarce, making supporting them difficult. This study sought to understand the stresses which EAUSPs identify being prevalent in their lives along with coping strategies which they have found to be effective. To do so, interviews were conducted with 12 EAUSPs and communications regarding stresses were coded into four central themes: health, time management, uncertainties, and finances. Three coping strategies also emerged: seeking social support, taking <b>things</b> <b>one</b> day <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, and physical fitness. By better understanding these common stressors, I hope to establish a foundation for future research which may lead to the development of university policies and social support strategies which may improve the ability of EAUSPs to reach their goals and improve their quality of life...|$|R
