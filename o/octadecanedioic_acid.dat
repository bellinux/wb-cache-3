Moreover, dicarboxylic acids are potentially toxic to cellular processes. Previous studies [Tonsgard, Mendelson & Meredith (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 1567 - 1573] demonstrated that long-chain dicarboxylic acids {{have a single}} high-affinity binding site and between one and three lower-affinity sites on albumin. Medium-chain-length dicarboxylic acids have a single low-affinity site. We further characterized dicarboxylic acid binding to albumin {{in order to understand}} the potential effects of drugs and other ligands on dicarboxylic acid binding and toxicity. Progesterone and oleate competitively inhibit <b>octadecanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> binding to the single high-affinity site. Octanoate inhibits binding to the low-affinity sites. Dansylated probes for subdomain 2 AB inhibit dodecanedioic acid binding whereas probes for subdomain 3 AB do not. In contrast, low concentrations of <b>octadecanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibit the binding of dansylated probes to subdomain 3 AB and 2 AB. L-Tryptophan, which binds in subdomain 3 AB, inhibits hexadecanedioic acid binding but has no effect on dodecanedioic acid. Bilirubin and acetylsalicylic acid, which bind in subdomain 2 AB, inhibit the binding of medium-chain and long-chain dicarboxylic acids. Our results suggest that long-chain dicarboxylic acids bind in subdomains 2 C, 3 AB and 2 AB. The single low-affinity binding site for medium-chain dicarboxylic acids is in subdomain 2 AB. These studies suggest that dicarboxylic acids are likely to be unbound in disease states and may be potentially toxic...|$|E
