5|$|Having {{recovered}} {{enough from}} {{the events of the}} previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> She ventures upstairs to investigate; after failing to find anything, she accidentally fires her weapon, narrowly missing Peter. They bring Hughes in for questioning, and he refuses to give them a blood sample for their investigation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part <b>One,</b> <b>there</b> was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar {{gameplay}} elements {{with its}} predecessor, Super Mario 64, while introducing various new gameplay features. Players control Mario {{as he tries}} to obtain 120 Shine Sprites in order to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr. (disguised as Mario) steals the Shine Sprites and covers the island in toxic slime. Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Similar to collecting Stars in Super Mario 64, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing <b>one.</b> <b>There</b> are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites in the boathouse in Delfino Plaza.|$|E
5|$|A {{featured}} match {{heading into}} Against All Odds was the debuting of Full Metal Mayhem, in which Abyss fought Jeff Hardy, with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

In this particular <b>one</b> <b>there</b> were two envelopes, one with a contract for the championship match, while {{the other one was}} empty. At TNA's previous PPV, Final Resolution, Abyss attacked Hardy after his match with Scott Hall. On the January 21 episode of Impact!, Abyss attacked Hardy once again and this time by slamming him through a table. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, TNA advertised the debut of Full Metal Mayhem between Hardy and Abyss at Against All Odds. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, the second stipulation of the match was announced, that the winner would gain a future championship match on a future edition of Impact!.|$|E

5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the <b>One.</b> <b>There,</b> Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E
5|$|After his {{translation}} to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to {{his brother}} Æthelmær, but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor <b>one,</b> <b>there</b> was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury {{may not have been}} secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.|$|E

Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E

5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common <b>one,</b> <b>there</b> were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E
5|$|Following {{its premiere}} in early September at the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood {{tradition}} of visiting different theaters {{on opening night}} to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers {{did not like the}} film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The film closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.|$|E
