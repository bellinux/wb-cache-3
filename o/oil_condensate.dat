30|$|Since around 2008, U.S. {{natural gas}} drillers, stung by decade-low gas prices from the over-supply of shale gas, have focused {{significant}} efforts on producing {{oil from the}} liquids-rich shale plays, such as Eagle Ford.

40|$|The {{origin and}} source rocks of crude <b>oils</b> and <b>condensates</b> from seven <b>oil</b> and gas fields {{located in the}} Surma basin, Bangladesh were {{investigated}} based on saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon distributions.

The abundance and similar distribution of biphenyls, cadalene and bicadinanes {{in most of the}} crude <b>oils</b> and <b>condensates</b> indicates a significant supply of higher-plant derived organic matter to the source rocks. Maturity levels of <b>oils</b> and <b>condensates</b> from the Surma basin were estimated based on the alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthlenes, and diamondoids, correspond to calculated vitrinite reflectance (Rc) values of 1. 0 – 1. 3 %. Rc (%) values indicating hydrocarbon expulsion from the source rock at a comparatively high maturity level. The Rc values of oils from the Titas field in the southern margin of the Surma basin are relatively low (0. 8 – 1. 0 %). Some oils were severely biodegraded. The similar distribution of diamondoid hydrocarbons in both biodegraded and non-biodegraded oils indicated similar type of source rocks and similar maturity levels to those of oils from the Surma basin. Although the geochemical data set for the Oligocene and older sedimentary sequences is limited, the top of the Eocene Kopili Shale to lower Jenam Shale of early Oligocene sedimentary rocks rich in terrigenous organic matter are identified as possible source rocks. The relative abundance of C 7 aromatic, cyclic, and straight chain hydrocarbons in <b>oil</b> and <b>condensates</b> and other molecular parameters inferred diversity of the petroleum from waxy crude <b>oils</b> to <b>condensates</b> in the study area.

The modified UOP 938 method (defined hereas operational speciation) allowed various mercury compounds to be grouped into different families, i. e. particulate,volatile, ionic and organic non-ionic mercury,whereas SEC-ICP-HRMS provided size distribution profiles ofmercury-containing molecules.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} well with multiple transverse fractures {{has proven to}} be an effective strategy for shale gas reservoir exploitation. Some operators are successfully producing shale oil using the same strategy. Due to its higher viscosity and eventual 2 -phase flow conditions when the formation pressure drops below the oil bubble point pressure, shale oil is likely to be limited to lower recovery efficiency than shale gas. However, the recently discovered Eagle Ford shale formations is significantly over pressured, and initial formation pressure is well above the bubble point pressure in the oil window. This, coupled with successful hydraulic fracturing methodologies, is leading to commercial wells. This study evaluates the recovery potential for oil produced both above and below the bubble point pressure from very low permeability unconventional shale oil formations. We explain how the Eagle Ford shale is different from other shales such as the Barnett and others. Although, Eagle Ford shale produces <b>oil,</b> <b>condensate</b> and dry gas in different areas, our study focuses in the oil window of the Eagle Ford shale. We used the logarithmically gridded locally refined gridding scheme to properly model the flow in the hydraulic fracture, the flow from the fracture to the matrix and the flow in the matrix. The steep pressure and saturation changes near the hydraulic fractures are captured using this gridding scheme. We compare the modeled production of shale oil from the very low permeability reservoir to conventional reservoir flow behavior. We show how production behavior and recovery of oil from the low permeability shale formation {{is a function of the}} rock properties, formation fluid properties and the fracturing operations. The sensitivity studies illustrate the important parameters affecting shale oil production performance from the stimulated reservoir volume. The parameters studied in our work includes fracture spacing, fracture half-length, rock compressibility, critical gas saturation (for 2 phase flow below the bubble point of oil), flowing bottom-hole pressure, hydraulic fracture conductivity, and matrix permeability. The sensitivity studies show that placing fractures closely, increasing the fracture half-length, making higher conductive fractures leads to higher recovery of oil. Also, the thesis stresses the need to carry out the core analysis and other reservoir studies to capture the important rock and fluid parameters like the rock permeability and the critical gas saturation...|$|E
