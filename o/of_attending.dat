Our approach differs from existing models that use gain fields by providing precise hypotheses about how the control signals are generated and distributed in a hierarchical model in spiking neurons. Further, the model accounts for numerous experimental findings regarding the timing, strength and extent of attentional modulation in ventral stream areas, and the perceived contrast enhancement <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli. |$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{assumed that the}} allocatian of spatial {{attention}} results in the "selection" <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> objects or regions of space.

This assumption is {{based in part on}} experiments showing significant interference for attended stimuli when the response to an irrelevant dimension conflicts with the response to the relevant dimension (e. g., the Stroop effect). Here we show that such interference is not due to attending per se. In two spatial cuing experiments, we found {{that it was possible to}} restrict processing <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli to task-relevant dimensions. This new evidence supports two novel conclusions: (a) Selection involves more than the focusing of attention per se: and (b) task expectations play a key role in detertnining the depth of processing of the elementary feature dimensions <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli...|$|R

5|$|Because of William's {{impending}} {{retirement and}} the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes <b>of</b> <b>attending</b> a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize. On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall. After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Mason {{was born}} in Stalybridge, Cheshire, on 11May 1817 and christened there.

After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier Slacks Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand into the Bank Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh was working in the mill, and his education consisted <b>of</b> <b>attending</b> Methodist Sunday schools in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
40|$|SummaryAlthough we have convincing {{evidence}} that attention to auditory stimuli modulates neuronal responses at or before the level of primary auditory cortex (A 1), the underlying physiological mechanisms are unknown. We found that attending to rhythmic auditory streams resulted in the entrainment of ongoing oscillatory activity reflecting rhythmic excitability fluctuations in A 1. Strikingly, although {{the rhythm of the}} entrained oscillations in A 1 neuronal ensembles reflected the temporal structure <b>of</b> the <b>attended</b> stream, the phase depended on the attended frequency content. Counter-phase entrainment across differently tuned A 1 regions resulted in both the amplification and sharpening <b>of</b> responses at <b>attended</b> time points, in essence acting as a spectrotemporal filter mechanism. Our data suggest that selective attention generates a dynamically evolving model <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> auditory stimulus streams in the form of modulatory subthreshold oscillations across tonotopically organized neuronal ensembles in A 1 that enhances the representation <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli...|$|R

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead <b>of</b> <b>attending</b> the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

40|$|Why {{are nearly}} {{simultaneous}} stimuli frequently perceived in reversed order? The origin of errors in temporal judgments {{is a question}} older than experimental psychology itself. One of the earliest suspects is attention. According {{to the concept of}} prior entry, attention accelerates attended stimuli; thus they have "prior entry" to perceptive processing stages, including consciousness. Although latency advantages for attended stimuli have been revealed in psychophysical studies many times, these measures (e. g. temporal order judgments, simultaneity judgments) cannot test the prior-entry hypothesis completely. Since they assess latency differences between an attended and an unattended stimulus, they cannot distinguish between faster processing <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli and slower processing of unattended stimuli. Therefore, we present a novel paradigm providing separate estimates for processing advantages respectively disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> and unattended stimuli. We found that deceleration of unattended stimuli contributes more strongly to the prior-entry illusion than acceleration <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli. Thus, in the temporal domain, attention fulfills its selective function primarily by deceleration of unattended stimuli. That means it is actually posterior entry, not prior entry which accounts for the largest part of the effect...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} personality {{features on}} the PAI and Rorschach that predicted early termination from psychotherapy {{in a sample of}} 104 individuals receiving treatment at a University-Affiliated Training Clinic. Early or premature termination was characterized in several ways – patients who terminated during the intake and patients who commenced treatment but terminated before the eighth session. In addition to the two categorical outcome variables, the number <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> sessions at point of termination was a third outcome variable. The findings indicated that four PAI scales (PIM, INF, WRM, PAR) were able to predict intake-completion and commencement of therapy, as well as the total number <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> sessions at point of termination. In addition, one composite Rorschach (RPAS) variable (SC-COMP) was able to predict the number <b>of</b> <b>attended</b> sessions. After interpreting the significant findings, several psychological/personality constructs seem to be related to therapeutic attendance - self-defeating patterns of behavior, interpersonal interest/desire, openness and authenticity, suspiciousness/trust toward others, and degree of task or activity engagement. ^ Keywords: premature termination, early termination, Rorschach, PAI, psychotherapy...|$|R
