50|$|The <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> is a {{fundamental}} and very effective passing technique. This pass consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> can easily result in a scoring assist because a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> is harder for defenders to steal. Still, a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> may be stolen due to its slower speed. So, a player must use his best judgment when he decides whether {{to make such a}} pass.|$|R
25|$|Another type of <b>pass</b> is the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass.</b> Here, the <b>passer</b> <b>bounces</b> {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} styles of passing the ball, {{including}} one-handed shouldered passes, two-handed passes (chest-passes), overhead <b>passes,</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>passes,</b> lob passes, drop passes, bullet passes and underarm passes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> is {{executed}} by getting {{low to the}} ground, holding the ball {{with one or two}} hands at hip height, and stepping forward while releasing the ball. The ball should be aimed low at the ground and released {{with a great deal of}} force. The purpose of the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> is to move the ball around an opponent. It is used when a player is in a confined space, with limited passing options.|$|R

5000|$|Love {{was born}} on September 7, 1988 in Santa Monica, California, the second of three {{children}} to Karen and Stan Love. He grew up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Klay Thompson. [...] Love played basketball from his earliest days; as a child, he would practice his <b>bounce</b> <b>passes</b> with a cardboard box and study tapes of Wes Unseld.|$|R
5000|$|Howard Clinton [...] "Clint" [...] Longley, Jr. (born July 28, 1952) is {{a former}} American {{football}} quarterback in the National Football League and Canadian Football League. He played two seasons for the Dallas Cowboys (1974-1975) {{and one for the}} San Diego Chargers (1976). Longley earned his nickname the [...] "Mad Bomber" [...] for <b>bouncing</b> <b>passes</b> off of Coach Tom Landry's coaching tower in the Cowboys' training camp.

5000|$|Ferrell {{was ranked}} {{the number one}} player in his class as a fifth grader by Clark Francis in the {{controversial}} [...] "Hoop Scoop" [...] rankings in 2004. At the time, Ferrell was playing for Lakeside Elementary in Warren Township and a travel team sponsored by Adidas. Just 10 years old and 4'10", Ferrell already had a crossover dribble, could hit a running jumper in the lane, and make one-handed <b>bounce</b> <b>passes</b> that hit teammates in stride.|$|R
5000|$|Teamwork was the {{hallmark}} of Mauer's system. Every player worked on {{every aspect of the}} game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south - the offensive screen and the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass.</b> The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the [...] "submarine attack." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{terminology}} {{of the game}} of cricket, a beamer (less commonly beam ball) {{is a type of}} delivery in which the ball (bowled at a fast pace), without <b>bouncing,</b> <b>passes</b> above the batsman's waist height. [...] Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, {{due to the lack of}} control a bowler has over high full tosses. [...] Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hallmark}} of the offense is the backdoor pass, where a player on the [...] suddenly moves in towards the basket, receives a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> from a guard on the perimeter, and (if done correctly) finds himself with no defenders between him and a layup. Alternatively, when the defensive team attempts to pack the paint to prevent backdoor cuts, the offense utilizes three point shots from the perimeter. All five players in the offense—including the center—should be competent at making a three point attempt, further spreading the floor.|$|R
5000|$|Mauer was {{the head}} coach in football, {{basketball}}, and track at Batavia High School, from 1926 to 1927, after which he {{was the head}} coach of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team of the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky from 1927 to 1930, immediately preceding the legendary Adolph Rupp. Mauer's successful Wildcats teams were known as the [...] "Mauer men," [...] {{and he was one of}} the first coaches to popularize the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> as an element of basketball offense. His Wildcats teams posted an overall win-loss record of 40-14 (.741) in three seasons.|$|R
5000|$|The Hoyas under Thompson III {{were known}} for {{employing}} {{a variant of}} the Princeton offense, a style of play that emphasizes ball movement. The hallmark of the offense was the [...] "backdoor" [...] pass, where a player on the wing suddenly moves towards the basket, receives a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> from a guard on the perimeter, and ideally finds himself with no defenders between him and a layup. Coach Thompson learned the style while serving under then-Coach Pete Carril of the Princeton University Tigers. Using this system, Georgetown had been lauded for excelling by emphasizing offensive efficiency rather than speed of play.|$|R
5000|$|The Leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Halftime (中场 Zhōng chǎng) or Full Court (全场 Quán chǎng). In Halftime, teams learned how to perform a Laker Girls cheerleading routine set {{to the tune of}} [...] "Mickey". When they have {{correctly}} performed the routine, they will receive the next clue. In Full Court, teams needed to complete an NBA official Skill Challenge. Both team members must perform an alley-oop, dribble through an obstacle course, perform a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> into a vertical hoop and perform a free throw and a 3-point shot {{at the side of the}} hoop. If both team members completed the course within four minutes, they would receive the next clue.|$|R
40|$|Neutrinos {{escaping}} from a core collapse supernova {{a few seconds}} after <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> through the shock wave, where they may encounter one or more resonances corresponding to Δ m^ 2 _atm. The neutrino mass eigenstates in matter stay coherent between these multiple resonances, giving rise to oscillations in the survival probabilities of neutrino species. We point out these novel "phase effects", and provide an analytic approximation to them that relates the density profile of the shock wave to the oscillation pattern. The phase effects can be strong if the multiple resonances encountered by neutrinos are semi-adiabatic, which typically happens for 10 ^- 5 sin^ 2 θ_ 13 10 ^- 3. These effects would manifest themselves in oscillations in the observed neutrino spectra for certain neutrino mixing scenarios. The time dependent neutrino spectra from a future galactic supernova can then {{be used to identify}} the neutrino mixing scenario as well as reconstruct the density profile in the region around the reverse shock...|$|R
5000|$|Lofting (by a bowler) in bowling is {{throwing}} {{a bowling ball}} more than a short distance down the lane. This is usually done with the <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> technique, but can also be done with a straight ball. Lofting is looked down upon by the bowling community and bowling alley employees because of {{the damage to the}} ball and lanes. Many bowling alleys that use wood for their lanes will either have signs that tell the bowlers not to loft, or an employee will tell the bowlers not to do so. Lofting the ball before the arrows in some bowling alleys is not against the rules. Some professional bowlers do loft a considerable amount under certain lane conditions. Crankers and other high-rev players may be forced to loft under dry conditions in order to delay the ball's reaction and prevent it from overhooking. Lofting over the gutter is known as [...] "popping the cap" [...] and is done when a bowler hooks the whole lane.|$|R
50|$|The game {{starts off}} with a coin toss. When a team is kicking off they must be on {{their side of the}} midline, the {{opposing}} team must be {{on the opposite side of}} the midline and outside the circle. Whichever team wins the toss will start with the ball in the middle of the field. Speedaway uses a soccer ball which may be moved down the field on the ground as in soccer, or by passing through the air similar to football. When an offensive player has possession of the ball and an opponent tags or simply touches him or her, the player must instantly drop the ball and give possession to the defending team. The team that gains possession must now kick the ball from where it was dropped. To pass the ball to a teammate, one may kick, throw, or <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> accordingly. When <b>bounce</b> <b>passing</b> to another teammate the ball can only hit the ground once. If the ball bounces more than one time the team with possession cannot pick the ball back up. When the ball is kicked or thrown out of bounds, the team that last touched the ball loses possession and the opposite team may throw or kick the ball into the field. Only the goalie can pick up the ball with his or her hands at any give time. All players, beside the goalie, have to kick the ball up to themselves from the ground in order to run with the ball or make aerial passes. Each team has three time-outs they may use during the game. Any player with possession of the ball may call time-out when the ball is dead or when someone is injured. The game is broken down into four quarters and two halves each quarter being ten minutes long, making the game forty minutes. Speedaway ball is officiated by two referees, each official is responsible for each half of the field. Their responsibilities include: stopping the game after each quarter, calling fouls, and out of bounds plays. Officials must place the ball before kick offs and have the authority to remove players from play who are being too aggressive, in their own judgement.|$|R
40|$|Neutrinos {{escaping}} from a core collapse supernova {{a few seconds}} after <b>bounce</b> <b>pass</b> through the shock wave, where they may encounter one or more resonances corresponding to Δ m^ 2 _ atm. The neutrino mass eigenstates in matter may stay coherent between these multiple resonances, giving rise to oscillations in the survival probabilities of neutrino species. We provide an analytical approximation to these inevitable phase effects, that relates the density profile of the shock wave to the oscillation pattern. The phase effects are present only if the multiple resonances encountered by neutrinos are semi-adiabatic, which typically happens for 10 ^- 5 sin^ 2 θ_ 13 10 ^- 3. The observability of these oscillations is severely limited by {{the inability of the}} detectors to reconstruct the neutrino energy faithfully. For typical shock wave profiles, the detection of these phase effects seems rather unlikely. However, if the effects are indeed identified in the spectra, they would establish inverted hierarchy and a nonzero value of θ_ 13. Comment: 10 pages, 9 eps figures. Major changes made.

50|$|The best-known study demonstrating inattentional {{blindness}} is the Invisible Gorilla Test, {{conducted by}} Daniel Simons of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Christopher Chabris of Harvard University. This study, a {{revised version of}} earlier studies conducted by Ulric Neisser, Neisser and Becklen in 1975, asked subjects to watch a short video of two groups of people (wearing black and white T-shirts) pass a basketball around. The subjects are told to either {{count the number of}} passes made by one of the teams or to keep count of <b>bounce</b> <b>passes</b> vs. aerial passes. In different versions of the video a woman walks through the scene carrying an umbrella (as discussed above), or wearing a full gorilla suit. After watching the video the subjects are asked if they noticed {{anything out of the ordinary}} take place. In most groups, 50% of the subjects did not report seeing the gorilla (or the woman with the umbrella). The failure to perceive the anomalies is attributed to the failure to attend to it while engaged in the difficult task of counting the number of passes of the ball. These results indicate that the relationship between what is in one's visual field and perception is based much more on attention than was previously thought.|$|R
50|$|Iguodala {{immediately}} streaked up {{the floor}} as Stephen Curry sprinted ahead on the left wing. The only Cavaliers player {{who appeared to be}} in position to defend the fast break was J.R. Smith, who quickly began back-pedaling towards his own basket. James, standing in the corner in front of the Warriors bench, took off after them. Iguodala passed half court, threw a chest pass to Curry who immediately gave it back with a <b>bounce</b> <b>pass.</b> Iguodala gathered the ball, took two steps as he powered past Smith and toward the hoop before going airborne. Good defense on the initial layup attempt by Smith forced Iguodala to delay the release of his shot by a few tenths-of-a-second, double-pumping before softly floating the ball up toward the glass. James, who had been trailing the play {{the entire length of the}} floor, sized up the shot and sprung at the ball from behind, knocking the potential layup off the glass with 1:50 remaining. The ball was grabbed by Smith and brought back up the floor. After James and Curry traded misses, Irving scored a three-pointer with 52 seconds to play to put the Cavaliers in the lead for the remainder of the game. This is cited as a key sequence in deciding the outcome of the 2016 championship.|$|R
