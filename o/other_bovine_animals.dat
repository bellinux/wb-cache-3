50|$|Every {{bovine animal}} in the United Kingdom (as {{elsewhere}} in the European Union) has a unique number, shown both on an ear tag in each ear and on a paper cattle passport which is held by the current keeper of the animal. The system covers cattle and also <b>other</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> such as water buffalo, yak, bison and hybrids. The number and passport remain with the animal throughout its life, and are recorded by the slaughterhouse at its death, allowing traceability of the beef. The BCMS central database is called the Cattle Tracing System, and works alongside the physical passport to record the births, deaths and movements of all cattle.|$|E
50|$|Lipoptena cervi, {{the deer}} ked or deer fly, is {{a species of}} biting fly in the family of louse flies, Hippoboscidae. These flies are {{commonly}} encountered in temperate areas of Europe, Siberia and Northern China. It has been introduced to North America. They are parasites of elk, deer and <b>other</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals,</b> burrowing through the fur and sucking {{the blood of the}} host animals. L. cervi is relatively small, adults usually being 5 - 7 mm in length and are brownish in colour. Their body is flat and elastic, making their removal difficult. L. cervi is a poor flier and can only fly for short distances. Once the insect reaches its target, it sheds its wings and starts burrowing through the fur.|$|E
40|$|Horses {{were high}} status {{animals in the}} middle ages. Strong, costly, and used in war, they symbolized power and wealth. Yet in some Trecento Italian frescos, horses take on another role. Particularly through their eyes, ears, and body {{positioning}} they seem {{to communicate with each}} other regarding the religious scenes at hand. Additionally, horses are often the only beings paying attention to Jesus or God, or are the sole beings who break the fourth wall of an image to engage with the viewer. While the revolutionary use of gesture and eye movement has been examined in humans in these frescoes, horses (and <b>other</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals)</b> have been left out of the conversation. Why are these animals seemingly the most aware and mentally active beings? Particularly remarkable frescos incorporate horses in this way in Florence, Padua, and Assisi, and San Gimignano. Giotto di Bondone, Pietro Lorenzetti, Taddeo Gaddi, Andrea di Bonaiuto, Altichiero da Zevio, Lippo Memmi (and their schools and assistants), completed large scale fresco cycles in churches in these cities that retain their importance and magnificence today. Eight panels from these cycles will be examined for their treatment of horses as a vehicle for emotional communication, in chronological order...|$|E

The farm animal quantity is 70 cattle and 1400 chicken. Animal wastes (poultry manure and <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> manure) were anaerobically fermented in the tank.

From three animal experiments, clenbuterol, diethylstilbestrol and stanozolol, the steroid profiles in urine of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> were compared before and after treatment. It was demonstrated that the steroid profiles were altered due to these treatments. A predictive multivariate model was built to identify deviations from normal population steroid profiles.

50|$|Tabanus bovinus, {{sometimes}} called the pale giant horse-fly, is a species of biting horse-fly. As the name suggests, it prefers <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> {{as the source of}} blood, although it may bite other kind of mammals as well. The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to prepare high quality compost in two {{different}} piles from a basis of <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> manure charged with olive wastes or viticulture residues, {{in accordance with the}} Italian law on the fertilizers (Law n. 748 / 1984 - art. 1 c). All the raw materials have been selected from a group of organic farms in Apulia region. The plant residues have been crushed and the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> manure has been prepared before preparing the mixture. Two piles of about 30 tons have been prepared with different composition. The first heap had the following composition: 60 % of <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> manure and 40 % olive wastes, the second one 70 % of manure and 30 % vineyard wastes. In order to produce quality compost chemical and physical analyses have been carried out in different stages of the compost production. Analyses explained {{the difference between the two}} piles, the evolution of the mineral elements (including heavy metals) and the evolution occurring to the organic matter. The compost cycle (90 days) has been monitored during the two main phases (active and curing phase) measuring temperature, pH, moisture, oxygen and C/N ratio. At the end of the cycle, the quality of compost has been evaluated by doing, both on manure and plant wastes, the following analyses : PH, Ashes, EC, Salts, Total Organic Carbon, Total nitrogen (N), C/N ratio, total Phosphorous (p), total Potassium, level of heavy metals in the two piles.

40|$|Abstract Subcutaneous and perirenal {{adipose tissue}} from <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> that had {{different}} fat deposition patterns were characterized {{in terms of}} the weight of the adipose tissue organ and adipose cell number and mean cell size as determined by electronic counting of osmium-fixed adipose cells. Similar parameters were also measured in the interfascicular adipose tissue dissected from four muscles. Adipose tissue from animals of the leaner Holstein breed contained smaller cells than the respective tissues from the fatter Hereford X Angus animals. The small subcutaneous deposit in the Holstein animals was due to a small number of adipose cells that were small in size. During growth of the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal,</b> an increase in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. However, by 14 months of life hyperplasia was complete in all but the interfascicular adipose tissue. In the 14 -month-old Hereford X Angus steers, interfascicular adipose tissue had an appreciable number of small cells and a bimodal distribution for cell diameter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that interfascicular adipose tissue is a late developing depot and that hyperplasia is still an active process in this depot at 14 months of life, whereas hyperplasia appears to be nearly complete in the subcutaneous and perirenal depots of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> by about 8 months of life or shortly thereafter. Correlation coefficients indicated that intramuscular lipid content was positively related to the number of interfascicular adipose cells per 100 g of muscle in four different muscles. However, average cell diameter and volume were significantly correlated to intramuscular lipid content in only one of the four muscles studied.

40|$|Domestic <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> are {{valuable}} resources to Filipinos {{because they are}} used as work animals and food source. Filipino farmers depend on water buffalos or carabaos for farm work. They consider the carabao as their beast of burden because it helps them till the lands. Cattle, like carabaos are also domesticated in the Philippines because they serve as important sources of meat and means of transport. Surely, Filipinos have a great need for domestic animals because they serve as sources of meat and milk and assist in agricultural-related activities. However, disaster struck the domestic <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> in the Philippines when carabaos and cattle were decimated by dangerous contagions during the American Period. The death of {{thousands and thousands of}} carabaos and cattle due to foot-and-mouth disease, cattle plague, bovine anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia affected the livelihood of many Filipino farmers and the business of cattle importers and local cattle raisers.
