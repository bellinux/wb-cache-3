In this study, the response of juvenile barramundi (47 · 0 g/fish initial weight) fed isolipidic and isoenergetic diets with 8 · 2 % added oil was tested. The experimental test diets were either devoid of fish oil (FO), and thus with no n- 3 LC-PUFA (<b>FO</b> <b>FREE</b> diet), or with a low inclusion of FO (FO LOW diet). These were compared against a control diet containing only FO (FO CTRL diet) as the added lipid source, over an 8 -week period. Interim samples and measurements were taken fortnightly during the trial in order to define the aetiology of the onset and progression of EFA deficiency. After 2 weeks, the fish fed the <b>FO</b> <b>FREE</b> and <b>FO</b> LOW diets had significantly lower live-weights, and after 8 weeks significant differences were detected for all performance parameters. The fish fed the <b>FO</b> <b>FREE</b> diet also had a significantly higher incidence of external abnormalities. The transcription of several genes involved in fatty acid metabolism was affected after 2 weeks of feeding, showing a rapid nutritional regulation. This experiment documents the aetiology of the onset and the progression of EFA deficiency in juvenile barramundi and demonstrates that such deficiencies can be detected within 2 weeks in juvenile fish...|$|R

40|$|The {{marketing}} of creative content such as books, video and music through {{the provision of}} free samples of content is emerging as a very common practice with the rapid penetration of broadband technology. For example, {{in the case of}} books, retailers such as Amazon provide free preview of the contents of some titles (typically one or two chapters) for customers to evaluate. Other publishers such as the National Academy Press provide the entire content of many of its titles for free online browsing (as one could do in a brick-and-mortar Barnes & Nobles store before purchasing a book). Similarly, the major television networks in the US now routinely provide either previews or even full videos of the previously aired shows – one could go to NBC. com to view the entire previously aired full episodes of “Heroes”, while CBS. com provides highlights of the previously aired shows of the new series “The Mentalist”. In the realm of music, video samples of new releases of singles by popular artists like Britney Spears and Rihanna are available for free online at MTV. com, Yahoo. com and YouTube for surfers to watch online, and these videos are official releases sanctioned by record studios (not pirated copies).

40|$|Course {{description}} The {{issue of}} regularity has obviously {{played a central}} role in the theory of Partial Differential Equations, almost since its inception, and despite the tremendous development, it still remains a very fruitful research field. Regularity estimates for degenerate and singular elliptic and parabolic equations have developed considerably in recent years, in many unexpected and challenging directions. Let us mention only few of the main contributions. • The celebrated Wiener criterion for quasi–linear elliptic equations has recently been given a new proof based on a sharp Harnack inequality for supersolutions, which allows for a straightforward generalizations to sub–elliptic equations (see [17]). • An intrinsic version of the parabolic Harnack inequality for non–negative solutions of quasi–linear degenerate parabolic equations, a well–known and long–standing open problem, has recently been established, opening the way to a thorough understanding of the structure of solutions of quasi–linear degenerate parabolic equations (see [4, 5]). • Uniqueness, symmetry and uniform rectifiability in some <b>free</b> boundary problems <b>fo...</b>|$|R

40|$|Model {{checking}} linear-time properties {{expressed in}} first-order logic has non elementary complexity, and thus various restricted logical languages are employed. In this paper we consider two such restricted specification logics, linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO 2). LTL is more expressive but FO 2 {{can be more}} succinct, and hence {{it is not clear}} which should be easier to verify. We take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a comparison of verification problems for FO 2, LTL, and various sublogics thereof across a wide range of models. In particular, we look at unary temporal logic (UTL), a subset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO 2; we also consider the stutter <b>free</b> fragment of <b>FO</b> 2, obtained by omitting the successor relation, and the expressively equivalent fragment of UTL, obtained by omitting the next and previous connectives. We give three logic-to-automata translations which can be used to give upper bounds for FO 2 and UTL and various sub-logics. We apply these to get new bounds for both nondeterministic systems (hierarchical and recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov chains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple these with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO 2 verification techniques with those for LTL. We present here a language that subsumes both FO 2 and LTL, and inherits the model checking properties of both languages. Our results give both a unified approach to understanding the behaviour of FO 2 and LTL, along with a nearly comprehensive picture of the complexity of verification for these logics and their sublogics. © M.

40|$|International audienceBeing {{a pragmatic}} {{and not a}} {{referential}} approach to semantics, dialogi-cal logic does not understand semantics as mapping names, propositions and relationships {{into the real world}} to obtain an abstract counterpart of it, but as dealing (handeln) with them in a particular way. This allows a very simple formulation of free logic the core of which can be expressed in a nutshell, namely: in an argumentation, it sometimes makes sense to restrict the introduction of singular terms in the context of quantification to a formal use o f them. That is, the proponent is allowed to use a constant if f this constant has been explicitly conceded by the opponent.

40|$|The {{research}} program was initiated to learn whether diazomethane ring expansion might prove a reasonable method of arriving at perhydroazulenes {{that are related}} to some sesquiterpenes. In the course of the investigation, which involved 4 -methyl-cis 3 a, 4, 7, 7 a-tetrahydrophthalan as a model, it was concluded that a methyl group can have powerful directive effects; possibly more electronic in nature than steric. Also, the choice of an oxygen heterocyclic system {{as a model for the}} carbocyclic systems resulted in an analysis of the long range directive effects of oxygen. Additional studies using a sulfur hetero-atom confirmed the long range hetero-interactions. As part of the study using oxygenated systems, the sex attractant of the bark beetle, Dendroctonus brevicomis, was prepared by an unambiguous synthesis. The initial question of the program, that of investigating the use of diazomethane ring expansion, was answered and evidence shows that the desired product is that obtained in greater quantity. Overall yields, however, appear to be prohibitive in using this as a synthetic route. The poor ring expansion may result from electronic and/or steric effects.

40|$|The Support Nuclei for Family Health (SNFH) born {{within the}} Primary Health Care (PHC), as a {{resolution}} attempt, especially towards {{the issues that}} relate to the integrality of care and the broadening of the scope of actions of the Family Health Strategy (FHS). The Mental Health (MH) arises in SNFH by insertion of professionals from this field, since in their structuring and organizational rules, despite working in a team and be highly interdisciplinary, some professions are responsible for conducting such care lines. By critically scrolling through the route of health policy, focusing on the FHS, we think the SNFH as one of the places where the professional practice seemed strategic to the reflections that we wanted to produce in this research. Thus, we aimed to investigate the MH actions that are evident in professional practice in the SNFH at the FHS in Fortaleza, CearÃ - Brazil. We used to do so within the qualitative health research, the proposal of the methodological triangulation, through Flowcharts Analyzers (FA) Focus Groups (FG) and <b>Free</b> Observations (<b>FO),</b> with the goal of combining the techniques of construction information around the research object because this gave us the opportunity to develop the research exploring different views and procedures, giving us more stability and rigor in approaching the object. Through theoretical and methodological affiliation to Hermeneutic-Dialectic, whose paradigmatic approach concerns the comprehensive critical posture, we present a construction of qualitative data in the lines of analysis, MH Practices in the PHC, Work Process in SNFH and "Unpublished" and "Viable" in SM in the FHS, which dialogued with the historical and conceptual apparatus presented in theoretical researches. The problematic created between the unpublished and the viable within the MH in SNFH meant that, given the practices developed - sometimes understood as new - performance/attention models systematized in daily life and organization of the work process in teams SNFH, interactioning with teams of reference, the viable - which "is the case" and "not the case" to the SNFH - is decided before the contextual markers of each care arrangement. Future studies may complement the results, especially regarding the need to complement the gaze of the reference teams on health practices. However, researching professional practice in mental health in the FHS, "in these SNFH cases", was an instrument to promote reflection for training new professionals, and has served to foster the attitude of (self-) criticism towards the practice, or praxis, of the current field workers, and especially a device for evaluating the quality of care, so important to advocate policies that look for differences, as the FHS, for the Unified Health System. Os NÃcleos de Apoio Ã SaÃde da FamÃlia (NASF) nascem, no Ãmbito da AtenÃÃo PrimÃria Ã SaÃde (APS), como tentativa de resoluÃÃo, sobretudo, das questÃes que se relacionam Ã integralidade do cuidado e ampliaÃÃo do escopo de aÃÃes da EstratÃgia SaÃde da FamÃlia (ESF). A SaÃde Mental (SM) surge no NASF por meio da inserÃÃo de profissionais deste campo, jÃ que em sua estruturaÃÃo normativa e organizativa, apesar do trabalho ser eminentemente em equipe e interdisciplinar, sÃo algumas categorias profissionais as responsÃveis por conduzir tais linhas de cuidado. Ao percorrer criticamente o percurso da polÃtica de saÃde, focando a ESF, pensamos o NASF como um dos espaÃos em que a prÃtica profissional pareceu estratÃgica para as reflexÃes que quisemos produzir nesta pesquisa. Assim, tivemos como objetivo investigar as aÃÃes em SM que se evidenciam na prÃtica dos profissionais do NASF na ESF do municÃpio de Fortaleza, CearÃ - Brasil. Utilizamos, para isso, no Ãmbito da pesquisa qualitativa em saÃde, a proposta de triangulaÃÃo metodolÃgica, atravÃs dos Fluxogramas Analisadores (FA), Grupos Focais (GF) e ObservaÃÃes Livres (OL), com o objetivo de combinar as tÃcnicas de construÃÃo das informaÃÃes em torno do objeto de pesquisa, pois esta nos forneceu a possibilidade de realizar a investigaÃÃo explorando diferentes visÃes e procedimentos, dando-nos mais estabilidade e rigor na aproximaÃÃo com o objeto. AtravÃs da filiaÃÃo teÃrico-metodolÃgica Ã HermenÃutica-DialÃtica, cujo enfoque paradigmÃtico diz respeito Ã postura crÃtica-compreensiva, apresentamos uma construÃÃo de dados qualitativos em que os eixos de anÃlise, PrÃticas de SM na APS, Processo de Trabalho no NASF e o âInÃditoâ e o âViÃvelâ em SM na ESF, dialogaram com o aparato histÃrico e conceitual apresentado nos referenciais teÃricos da pesquisa. A problemÃtica criada entre o inÃdito e o viÃvel no Ãmbito da SM no NASF quis dizer que, diante das prÃticas desenvolvidas - por vezes entendidas como novas -, modelos de atuaÃÃo/atenÃÃo sistematizados no cotidiano e organizaÃÃo do processo de trabalho nas equipes NASF, em interaÃÃo com as equipes de referÃncia, o viÃvel - o que âÃ casoâ e o que ânÃo Ã casoâ do NASF - Ã decidido diante dos marcadores contextuais de cada arranjo assistencial.
