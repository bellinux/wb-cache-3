50|$|In 1860, Emile Cornillot started {{creating}} handmade confectionery from premises on rue Colbert, Lille, {{specializing in}} bonbons. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> meant that in 1885, {{he moved to}} larger premises on rue de l'Hôpital militaire.|$|R

5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E
5|$|During Seyfried's time modeling, she {{appeared}} in print ads for clothing companies including Limited Too with Leighton Meester, and was featured on three covers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Valley High novel series.

5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest {{that it was in}} daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E

5|$|When {{the album}} was due for release, Parker {{arranged}} Presley's return to performing live. He {{made a deal with}} Kirk Kerkorian, owner of the Las Vegas International Hotel for Presley to play the newly built, 2,000-seat showroom for four weeks (two shows per night, with Mondays off) for $400,000. For his appearance, he assembled a band later known as the TCB Band: James Burton (guitar), John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar), Jerry Scheff (bass-guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums), Larry Muhoberac (piano) and Charlie Hodge (rhythm guitar, background vocals). The band was complimented by the backing vocals <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sweet</b> inspirations and The Imperials. His initial Las Vegas show attracted an audience of 101,500, setting a new Vegas performance record. By 1970, Presley began to tour the United States {{for the first time in}} thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweet</b> birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting at}} Deolali {{to embark for}} Egypt, the brigade {{conducted}} regimental and brigade training programmes during which all ranks and animals were inspected, and those found unfit for service were returned to their regimental depots. Between 27 and 29 October the brigade moved to Bombay for embarkation; six transport ships carrying most of the brigade sailed on 1 November, while a seventh ship carrying two squadrons of Mysore Lancers remained behind with mechanical problems and finally set sail a fortnight later. The {{main body of the}} brigade arrived at Suez on 16 November, travelled by train to Ismailia two days later and started their first war-time patrols along the banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Water Canal. The brigade was not assigned to a higher formation at this time but were Army Troops under command of General Headquarters. The Bikaner Camel Corps, another Imperial Service unit, was attached to the brigade at Ismailia for administrative purposes, but was not operationally attached. To expand the area the brigade could patrol, squadrons were detached to El Kubri, Kantarah and the Ferry Post crossing at Ismailia. At the same time, the brigade became responsible for patrolling the length of the Suez Canal. The other British forces defending the canal were more static infantry formations, comprising the 42nd (East Lancashire), and the 10th and 11th Indian Divisions, the latter included the Imperial Service Infantry Brigade as one of its three brigades. Their Turkish opponents had around 25,000 men in the region, including the 25th Division.|$|E

Although [...] "Wig-Wam Bam" [...] remained largely true to <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sweet's</b> previous recordings, <b>the</b> vocals and guitars had a harder, more rock-oriented sound, largely {{because it was}} the first Chinn-Chapman single on which only members of Sweet played.
