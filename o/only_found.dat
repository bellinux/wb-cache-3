5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> near the seashore living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} a large {{diversity}} of vegetation. Due to the temperature and climate differences between different areas and elevations of the park, {{not only is the}} typical Aegean flora present, but also many specimens normally <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in separate coastal areas of Turkey, such as in the Mediterranean, Marmara, and Black Sea regions.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in cells infected by the virus.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is {{infected}} by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is usually <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in teiid lizards; {{it may have}} entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to the}} island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo {{was named}} in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor {{on the basis}} of 15specimens found on an {{individual}} of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar. The specific name, voalavo, is taken from the generic name of the type host. Voalavo gymnocaudus, the only known host, is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands. A.voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, found on other Malagasy rodents. They are members of the genus Andreacarus, which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E

5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as silver birch, warty birch or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he <b>only</b> <b>found</b> one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur {{naturally}} in Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia salina formerly occurred in England. Within Great Britain, C. diaphanus is restricted to areas with a deficit of precipitation against evapotranspiration between April and September. This means that it is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> frequently in southern England, with scattered records {{as far north as}} Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the Iron Mountain Mine closed, but {{pollution}} {{continued and}} still continues, and in 1983, the Iron Mountain Mine was {{listed on the}} National Priorities List. The Iron Mountain Mine is known for having the most acidic naturally found water content on Earth, with samples having up to a −3.6 pH value when tested in the early 1990s, which is roughly 100 times the acidity of battery acid. However, this pH value is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> inside and near the mine, as the average pH of water entering the Spring Creek Reservoir is 4.12.|$|E
5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E
5|$|Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, {{hoping to}} find Rowley {{maintaining}} the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon <b>only</b> <b>found</b> Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force consisted of the frigates Vénus and Manche with the corvette Victor. Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron. French lookouts on shore spotted Ceylon but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with Vénus and Victor.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were <b>only</b> <b>found</b> {{on the sides of}} the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, {{is called}} a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart {{from the village of}} Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is <b>only</b> <b>found</b> in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from heaven to please his wife Satyabhama.|$|E
