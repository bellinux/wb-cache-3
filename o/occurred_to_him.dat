5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
25|$|Greenspan {{wrote in}} his 2008 book that the phrase <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in the bathtub while he was writing a speech.|$|E
60|$|It didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at {{the moment}} that the man meant <b>to</b> arrest <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|No sooner {{did this}} thought <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> than {{he put it}} into practice.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Red {{might have been}} turned to stone. It didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> disbelieve Slim at this point. Slim looked too {{genuinely}} the bearer of just such tidings. He said, finally, [...] "Oh, my." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{pioneer of}} {{lacrosse}} in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He {{came to the}} Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old {{with his family in}} 1853 {{but it was not until}} 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that lacrosse was a superior game.|$|E
25|$|Having seen Pietersen play at {{a school}} cricket festival, Clive Rice invited him to sign for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Pietersen {{accepted}} without hesitation, keen {{to make the most}} of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration. He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the decision would eventually have to be taken.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Radulovacki {{postulated}} the Adenosine Sleep Theory, (JPET, 228: 268-274, 1984). The {{idea for}} adenosine’s role in sleep <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after reading a paper by Sol Snyder’s group (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 78: 3260-64, 1981) {{about the importance}} of adenosine receptors in the behavioral actions of methylxanthines. In the article, the authors correlated the behavioral excitation produced by theophylline in micromolar concentrations with the blockade of adenosine receptors.|$|E
60|$|She spoke <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with {{an express}} {{conviction}} {{that what was}} wanted of her by him, {{as well as by}} others, was her money, and it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> contradict her.|$|R
60|$|He lay {{thus for}} some time, {{watching}} the receding and rapidly diminishing {{lights of the}} steamer without it ever once <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> call for help. He never had called for help in his life, {{and so it is}} not strange that he did not think of it now. Always had he depended upon his own prowess and resourcefulness, nor had there ever been since the days of Kala any to answer an appeal for succor. When it did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> it was too late.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not then}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that duty in this {{instance}} wore a much more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience.|$|R
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot {{trying to figure out how}} to get it running.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{gave her}} the name 'Dora', and he {{describes}} in detail in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life what his unconscious motivations for choosing such a name might have been. His sister's nursemaid {{had to give up}} her real name, Rosa, when she accepted the job because Freud's sister was also named Rosa—she took the name 'Dora' instead. Thus, when Freud needed a name for someone who could not keep her real name (this time, in order to preserve his patient's anonymity), Dora was the name that <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of {{computing}} all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
60|$|The dean's illness occasioned much mental {{turmoil in}} other places besides the deanery and {{adjoining}} library, and the idea which <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the meagre little prebendary about Mr. Slope did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> alone.|$|R
60|$|Maitland bowed again, and {{wondered}} more than ever. It did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> that the fewer people knew of so delicate a business {{the better for}} Margaret's sake.|$|R
60|$|He {{finished}} reading and folded up the pages, {{to find her}} regarding him still with that air of careful attention with which she had listened to his monotonous flow of words. He found her interest surprising. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> invest it with any personal element.|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the books}} Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his {{personal}} life {{to explain how the}} insights of REBT <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. All Out!: An Autobiography (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).|$|E
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for {{what he thought was a}} standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
60|$|That evening Robert told Sophy {{what had}} occurred, {{and said that}} it seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> an {{opportunity}} for getting on which might not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> again, but {{that he would be}} guided entirely by her.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake {{turned and}} looked the man over. There was {{something}} convincing about his tone and appearance. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> doubt for a moment a word of this stranger's story.|$|R
6000|$|It never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{how much}} simpler {{it would be}} to write a letter. The item for [...] "traveling expenses" [...] in his bill of costs must be {{something}} enormous.|$|R
500|$|Originally, Shannon McMahon {{was to be}} a {{recurring}} character and was due to be featured in [...] "The Truth", the series finale of The X-Files. However, Lawless, who has a history of miscarriages, became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed; her high-risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes. Carter called Lawless [...] "hot stuff", saying it was [...] "fun" [...] having a female Super Soldier, something that had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> or to the show's production crew.|$|E
500|$|During {{previous}} searches, {{including a}} visit by a repairman, no dog was heard. The house had been searched three times before, but the bedroom closet where {{her body was found}} was not searched. Rev. Harry McIntyre looked in bedroom closets on February 26, but it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to search the front-bedroom closet. [...] "I concentrated on the basement, believing the girl might have fallen down the stairs," [...] he said. A volunteer fireman, John Reeves, also searched the first-floor bedroom but not the closet. Barker may have been too frightened to cry out.|$|E
500|$|Bin Laden claimed, in 2004, {{that the}} idea of {{destroying}} the towers had first <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 1982, when he witnessed Israel's bombardment of high-rise apartment buildings during the 1982 Lebanon War. Some analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also claim that one motivation for the attacks was U.S. support of Israel. In 2004 and 2010, bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel, although most of the letter expressed bin Laden's disdain for President Bush and bin Laden's hope to [...] "destroy and bankrupt" [...] the U.S.|$|E
60|$|He was a nonchalant youth, with a freckled, mask-like face, the {{expression}} of which never varied. He appeared unconscious of the cat. Its existence did not seem <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|It never <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that, but {{for that}} picture or book, the artist would, in all probability, have been mouching about with a pipe in his mouth, getting into trouble.|$|R
60|$|It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{define what}} he meant by her 'goings on'; the {{expression}} was wide, vague, and suited to a Forsyte. And James had more than his common share of courage after lunch.|$|R
500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just do it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'. [...] That was Jon's vision, and it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that anything else would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Spurred by the {{reception}} of Pandora, in 1825 Etty exhibited his most ambitious work to date, [...] This was a huge canvas, 399cm (13ft 1in) across, showing a woman pleading {{for the life of}} a defeated soldier as another soldier prepares to kill him. Highly unusually for a history painting at the time, Etty did not base The Combat on an incident from literature, religion or history, but instead painted a scene entirely from his own imagination, based on an idea which had first <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 1821. (He was later to describe this type of painting as [...] "that class of compositions called by the Romans Visions, not having their origin in history or poetry".) ...|$|E
500|$|Stipe had {{difficulty}} writing lyrics for the Up album. In {{the case of}} [...] "At My Most Beautiful", it took the singer a year to write the song's verse because he needed {{to figure out what}} one could do to prompt the action described in the opening line. The solution finally <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> one morning, and he finished writing the words in 45 minutes. After a conversation with Patti Smith, Stipe was convinced that he needed to be fearless in his songwriting approach. In regards to [...] "At My Most Beautiful", he had grown tired writing ironic love songs and consequently endeavored to create [...] "the most romantic song I'd ever written".|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Mr. Crewe. He {{wanted to}} be of service, as we know. He {{was a man of}} ideas, and the opening {{sentences}} of the speech were already <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Up the river--at the 'Blue Boar', sir," [...] {{said the}} instructor, quite innocently--for {{it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that this simple little bit of {{information}} was just so much incriminating evidence against Sheen.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause, {{during which}} Sir Thomas seemed {{partially}} to recover command of himself. Doubts {{as to the}} propriety of a family row in mid-stairs appeared <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He moved forward.|$|R
