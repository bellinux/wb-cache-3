5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> driving the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this {{can also lead to}} less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions {{had yet to be}} implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains for the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, {{members of the community}} know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 {{years of experience in}} the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E

5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are {{to be replaced by}} the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and {{distance}} travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside, whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, the chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter rate with nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality.|$|E
