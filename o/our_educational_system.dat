60|$|Hours ago, Ernest, {{you asked}} me the use of Criticism. You {{might just as well}} have asked me the use of thought. It is Criticism, as Arnold points out, that creates the {{intellectual}} atmosphere of the age. It is Criticism, as I hope to point out myself some day, that makes the mind a fine instrument. We, in <b>our</b> <b>educational</b> <b>system,</b> have burdened the memory with a load of unconnected facts, and laboriously striven to impart our laboriously-acquired knowledge. We teach people how to remember, we never teach them how to grow. It has never occurred to us to try and develop in the mind a more subtle quality of apprehension and discernment. The Greeks did this, and when we come in contact with the Greek critical intellect, we cannot but be conscious that, while our subject- matter is in every respect larger and more varied than theirs, theirs is the only method by which this subject-matter can be interpreted. England has done one thing; it has invented and established Public Opinion, which is an attempt to organise the ignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force. But Wisdom has always been hidden from it. Considered as an instrument of thought, the English mind is coarse and undeveloped. The only thing that can purify it is the growth of the critical instinct.|$|E
60|$|And {{here we see}} most {{distinctly}} {{the vice}} of <b>our</b> <b>educational</b> <b>system.</b> It neglects the plant {{for the sake of}} the flower. In anxiety for elegance, it forgets substance. While it gives no knowledge conducive to self-preservation--while of knowledge that facilitates gaining a livelihood it gives but the rudiments, and leaves the greater part to be picked up any how in after life--while for the discharge of parental functions it makes not the slightest provision--and while for the duties of citizenship it prepares by imparting a mass of facts, most of which are irrelevant, and the rest without a key; it is diligent in teaching whatever adds to refinement, polish, éclat. Fully as we may admit that extensive acquaintance with modern languages is a valuable accomplishment, which, through reading, conversation, and travel, aids in giving a certain finish; it by no means follows that this result is rightly purchased at the cost of the vitally important knowledge sacrificed to it. Supposing it true that classical education conduces to elegance and correctness of style; it cannot be said that elegance and correctness of style are comparable in importance to a familiarity with the principles that should guide the rearing of children. Grant that the taste may be improved by reading the poetry written in extinct languages; yet it is not to be inferred that such improvement of taste is equivalent in value to an acquaintance with the laws of health. Accomplishments, the fine arts, belles-lettres, and all those things which, as we say, constitute the efflorescence of civilisation, should be wholly subordinate to that instruction and discipline in which civilisation rests. As they occupy the leisure part of life, so should they occupy the leisure part of education.|$|E

Monumental studies and achieve- ments in various spheres of life by developed and developing Nations of the world are often attributed to products of high standards of education. The efficacy and efficiency of <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> lies in its ability to deliver quality education in cost-effective ways. For such <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> to stand tall in attaining these goals, re-invigorated or repositioned administrative and supervisory functions in all <b>our</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> in general and vocational technical education in particular must be put in place. e-activity with all of its components have the potentials of bringing these experiences to bare in vocational technical education.

30|$|Once {{everyone}} was learning {{much the same}} things, assessments to compare their learning to what was taught followed naturally. Over centuries, as institutions {{and the value of}} their awards increased, it became desirable to standardize ways of measuring student success.

Grade-based assessment schemes and measurements of standardized outcomes were efficient and scalable ways to award credentials, given the available technologies up until the Internet age. As well as dire motivational consequences that I will discuss in the next section, the increasing significance of the role of credentialing of learning led to two quite divergent and, largely, mutually exclusive purposes for <b>our</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems.</b> They had to be not only smart learning environments, but also smart credentialing environments.|$|R
