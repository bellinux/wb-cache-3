2500|$|The {{paradox is}} that a {{measurement}} made on either of the particles apparently collapses {{the state of the}} entire entangled system—and does so instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel faster than light) and hence assured the [...] "proper" [...] outcome of the measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> of the entangled pair. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the [...] "right choice" [...] when it too is measured.|$|E

This is a policy for a state too small for agriculture. It is not (for instance) fit for so great a country as the Pope possesses,--where, however, it is adopted and pursued in a greater extent, and with more strictness. Certain of the Pope's territories, from whence the city of Rome is supplied, being obliged to furnish Rome and the granaries of his Holiness with corn at a certain price, that part of the Papal territories is utterly ruined. That ruin may be traced with certainty to this sole cause; and it appears indubitably by a comparison of their state and condition with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> of the ecclesiastical dominions, not subjected to the same regulations, which are in circumstances highly flourishing.|$|E
