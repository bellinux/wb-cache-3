5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive.

5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E

5|$|At Battle of Novi, his {{division}} {{was part of}} Laurent Saint-Cyr's right wing. At the battle itself, his troops {{were the only ones}} properly positioned; the rest of the French army was otherwise out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> unready for battle. He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating off two Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E

At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E

25|$|Reviews have {{praised the}} novel's realism, {{believable}} characters and dialogue, sense <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> {{the complexity of}} the novel. The Guardian picked out Pelecano's ability to provide authentic voices for his characters but criticised instances where the narrative voice was inconsistent with the reality of the character. Other reviewers have commented that the gory detail and social realism may be offputting for some readers. The New York Times commented that the blaming of some of the characters' behaviour on the absence of father figures may be an oversimplification.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian Railway Museum has {{its origins}} from 1896. It {{gathered}} historical items from various railways and {{had from the}} opening of the third station until 1912 a display in the upper floor of the terminus building. At that time the station ran out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue {{for more than a decade}} while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured a lot to the north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.|$|E
25|$|The Temple {{stressed}} egalitarian ideals, asking {{members to}} attend in casual clothes so poor members would not feel out <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> providing {{shelter for the}} needy. While the Temple had increased its African-American membership from 15% to nearly 50%, in order to attempt further gains the Temple hired African-American preacher Archie Ijames (who had earlier given up organized religion). Pastor Ijames {{was one of the}} first to commit to Jones' socialist collective program. In 1959, the church joined the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and was renamed the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel. This affiliation was a successful attempt to both raise the dwindling membership and restore the reputation of the organization.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{diamonds}} are safely irradiated in four ways: proton and deuteron bombardment via cyclotrons; {{gamma ray}} bombardment via exposure to cobalt-60; neutron bombardment via {{the piles of}} nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment via Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> producing color centers. Irradiated diamonds are all some shade of green, black, or blue after treatment, but most are annealed to further modify their color into bright shades of yellow, orange, brown, or pink. The annealing process increases the mobility of individual carbon atoms, allowing some of the lattice defects created during irradiation to be corrected. The final color {{is dependent on the}} diamond's composition and the temperature and length of annealing.|$|E
