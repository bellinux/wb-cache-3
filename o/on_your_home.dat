40|$|To {{encourage}} home ownership, the United States {{tax code}} treats the financing {{and sale of}} housing differently from most other goods. For example, the interest payments <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> mortgage and your property taxes are deduct-ible from your federal income taxes while the interest on your credit card bill for your vacation to Paris is not. Furthermore, the profit you make {{on the sale of}} your house may be exempt from capital gains taxation, but similar profits on your mutual funds are not. These special provisions in the tax code–the deductibility of mortgage in-terest and property taxes from federal income taxes and the special treatment of capital gains on the sale of owner-occupied housing–effec-tively lower the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to other goods.

40|$|IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is an {{architectural}} framework for delivering IP multimedia to fixed and mobile users. IMS promises {{to facilitate the}} blending of quad-play services (voice, video, TV and mobility) in interactive, personalized ways. Delivery of a quad-play bundle, with one monthly-bill, is a highly desirable objective for service providers of all types – especially wireline operators. Such an offering would allow service providers to achieve a higher ARPU (average revenue per user), reduce customer churn, and win new subscribers. As we will see, the IMS architecture also offers the ability to reduce OPEX (operating expenses) and {{is a means of}} rapidly deploying new and unique combinations of services. If the quad-play components were merely bundled together as four discrete services, providers could only compete on price – a no-win situation. Instead, while continuing to supply high-quality voice, video and data services that subscribers are accustomed to, they must offer features that blend IPTV with other services, such as presence, instant messaging and telephony applications. The number of combinations is potentially limitless. Some of the possibilities include: � Mobile TV – the ability to watch your favorite TV programs <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> set, cell phone, PC or laptop. � TV telephony – the ability to receive a phone call while watching TV. The program would pause and display caller ID information and allow you to choose to take the call or refer it to voice mail. � IM with TV – the ability to communicate with friends and colleagues about a program you’re both watching. � Remote DVR – the ability to program your DVR remotely to record programs that you might miss, and then to play them back via Mobile TV. IPTV is the common thread for these and other combination services. IMS is the framework that makes such innovative blended features possible...|$|E
