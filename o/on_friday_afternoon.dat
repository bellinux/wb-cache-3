The Sauber team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix in Formula One. The weather was forecast to be wet all weekend, with especially treacherous conditions <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and Saturday, while the race day itself {{was expected to be}} slightly less wet.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; {{the first was}} held on Friday morning, with the second held on Saturday morning. Both were held in damp conditions due to overnight rain with the track drying towards {{the conclusion of the}} respective sessions. Both sessions lasted 1hour and 45minutes. Qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either of the two qualifying sessions counted towards their final grid position.|$|E
5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made it into the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E

5|$|Grace's bad wicket batting {{skills were}} fully {{tested in the}} first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 {{in a total of}} only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each for the Players. The Players replied with 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2–37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6–60. The Gentlemen {{produced}} a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3–30 as the Players were bowled out for 101, the match ending <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{managed to}} recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen. However, {{one of the major}} surprises came from Scuderia Toro Rosso, as Scott Speed posted the third quickest time, with Vitantonio Liuzzi posting the fifth quickest time. During the session, Liuzzi was {{involved}} in a bizarre incident with Anthony Davidson; Davidson exited his garage, and smashed his Super Aguri into the side of Liuzzi's Toro Rosso; knocking his front wing off in the accident. Alonso finished the second practice session eighth.|$|E

5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over {{at the side of}} the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> Kyle Busch was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 29.378 seconds, ahead of Kahne and Robby Gordon. Bowyer was fourth-fastest; Johnson was fifth and Truex sixth. Greg Biffle, Kurt Busch, Burton, and Martin followed in the top ten. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was eleventh-fastest, Hamlin set the twelfth-fastest time, and Harvick was 15th. Ryan Newman crashed and switched to a back-up car. Later, on Saturday afternoon, Earnhardt paced the final practice session with a time of 29.357; Kyle Busch was second and Hamlin third. Kahne was fourth-fastest, ahead of Johnson and Bowyer. Biffle was seventh-fastest, Truex eighth, Riggs ninth, and Robby Gordon tenth. Other Chase drivers included Jeff Gordon in 13th and Burton in 15th; all were within three-tenths of a second of Earnhardt's time.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E

5|$|The 1878 Canterbury Festival {{consisted}} of two first-class matches played between Monday, 5 August and Friday, 9 August. at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. The first match, between Thirteen of Kent and an England XI, finished early on the Wednesday. The second match, between Twelve of Kent and Twelve of MCC, began later the same afternoon and finished <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Grace played in both games, representing England and MCC. The Kent XIII won the match against England by 8 wickets. Grace scored 21 and 14; with the ball, he took 5–72 and 1–21. Kent defeated MCC in the twelves game by 9 wickets after Grace was out for 0 and 1. He took 4–82 in Kent's first innings total of 216 but did not bowl in the second innings when Kent needed just 20 to win.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{practice}} session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Ferrari {{was able to}} reduce the gap to Mercedes, with Vettel third {{a little more than}} seven-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Nico Rosberg was just 0.021 seconds off his teammate's time of 1m24.279s, even leading through the first two sectors but losing fastest time through the third and final sector. The two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg split the two Ferrari drivers, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in sixth. Max Verstappen was the second Toro Rosso driver of the day to spin out into the gravel, but he was able to continue after losing control of his car at the Ascari chicane. There were technical problems for both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button. While the Australian had to cut his first run short due to a hydraulical issue, Button was summoned back into the pit lane after only three laps with an unspecified problem.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> while Rosberg was unable to partake due to a water leak on his car. Hamilton's time of 1:31.660 was over three-tenths of a second faster than that of second places Daniel Ricciardo. Fellow Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was third, ahead of Vettel, all within one second of the fastest time. Ferrari split their practice strategy, with Kimi Räikkönen running the hard-compound tyre early in the session, while Vettel used the softer medium compound, before both switched to the soft tyres. At their home race, McLaren had a mixed session. While Fernando Alonso placed a good sixth, teammate Jenson Button had {{to take to the}} garage for repairs twice, before coming out on track again late in the session, eventually setting the ninth fastest time. Daniil Kvyat was 13th fastest, but damaged his front wing when he went over a kerb at Club corner.|$|E

All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty, as contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the public-house or in his own home. So that the children could fetch the money, school closed early <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoons.</b> Each of the Morel children--William, then Annie, then Paul--had fetched the money <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoons,</b> until they went themselves to work. Paul used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag in his pocket. Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men were seen trooping to the offices.|$|R

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> with Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button spun out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Thursday and a {{third on}} Friday—were held before the Saturday race. The Thursday afternoon and evening sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The first session was held in sunny weather conditions. The No. 1 Porsche 919 Hybrid driven by Hartley led the 90-minute period through its mid-way point with the fastest lap time of the day, at one minute and 58.012 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second ahead of team-mate Jani in second. Audi's second R18 was twice shown a black and orange flag {{because of a lack}} of telemetry for which the team was given a €1,000 suspended fine for the remainder of the race weekend and were required to change the vehicle's battery. LMP2 was led by Pipo Derani's No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 8.974 seconds which was recorded within the session's first-quarter. Adam's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in the LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped the British manufacturer to be fastest in LMGTE Am.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on track with twenty minutes of the session left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited track time as a problem with his exhaust pipe forced him to miss {{the early part of}} the session. With loose kerbs detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the kerbs at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on track, with some having to take to the run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only one}} having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Mercedes confirmed their good form from pre-season testing and topped the time sheets by a considerable margin {{in the first}} two practice sessions on Friday, with Nico Rosberg fastest in both outings. Valtteri Bottas in the Williams was third fastest on Friday morning, some 1.2 seconds down on Rosberg's time. Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettel was third <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> seven-tenths of a second down on Rosberg. Toro Rosso showed promising times, outperforming their sister team Red Bull in the first session. Only 16 cars participated on Friday morning. Sauber kept to the garage due to their legal troubles while Manor Marussia was unable to get their cars running all weekend. The Saubers did go out for the second session, while local favourite Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa missed the session due to problems with their cars. McLaren's problems continued as both cars were limited to very few laps. The first session also saw another evaluation run of the new Virtual Safety Car system.|$|E
