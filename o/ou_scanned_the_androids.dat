40|$|The {{character}} of <b>the</b> <b>android</b> is found widely in film and literature. While she appears {{across the entire}} spectrum of genres, she most often makes her appearance in the uncanny text. This appearance is nearly always accompanied by some variation of the vision motif. Despite wide spread interest in both the ‘Uncanny’ and <b>the</b> <b>android,</b> to date, {{there is not a}} theory which accounts for the uncanny nature of <b>the</b> <b>android</b> and <b>the</b> prevalence of the vision motif in <b>the</b> <b>android</b> text. This paper will attempt to develop just such a theory. 	Any paper that addresses the ‘Uncanny’ must begin with Freud’s 1919 essay, The Uncanny. While this paper does not propose a psychoanalytic reading of <b>the</b> <b>android,</b> Freud’s work establishes the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>android</b> and <b>the</b> binary oppositions of strange/familiar, alive/dead and animate/inanimate. This discussion of binary oppositions leads to Ernst Jentsch’s 1909 publication, “On the Psychology of the Uncanny. ” Jentsch’s work is used to develop the uncanniness of the mechanical nature of life. Following Jentsch, Masahiro Mori’s 1970 publication, “The Uncanny Valley,” places the human and <b>the</b> <b>android</b> on <b>the</b> same continuum, thus eliminating the opposition of man/machine. This, in turn, leads into a discussion of Donna Haraway’s The Cyborg Manifesto. Haraway’s model of the cyborg moves the discussion even further from dichotomous thought. The ‘Uncanny,’ it is concluded, is located at the midpoint of the binary pair. <b>The</b> <b>android</b> is uncanny because of her pivotal role in the dissolution of such pairs. Specifically, she compromises the mechanical/organic dichotomy. <b>The</b> <b>android</b> illustrates <b>the</b> mechanical nature of all life, thus making all life uncanny. 	The absolute foregrounding of vision in <b>the</b> <b>android</b> text requires a rethinking of <b>the</b> <b>android.</b> While android life is no different than human life in its mechanical qualities, <b>the</b> <b>android</b> nonetheless retains one fundamental difference: <b>the</b> <b>android</b> is designed. Thus androids, through an adaptation of Laura Mulvey’s “Visual Pleasure in Narrative Cinema,” {{can be thought of as}} to-be-looked-at-ness machines. This enters <b>the</b> <b>android</b> into a reciprocal relationship with the camera, the looking-at-machine. It is this reciprocal machine-machine relationship which explains the ubiquitous pairing of <b>the</b> <b>android</b> with themes of vision.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{security}} of <b>Android</b> has been recently {{challenged by the}} discovery of a number of vulnerabilities involving different layers of <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> stack. We argue that such vulnerabilities are largely related to the interplay among layers composing <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> stack. Thus, we also argue that such interplay has been underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper we provide a simple model of <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> cross-layer interactions based on the concept of flow, as a basis for analyzing <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> interplay. In particular, our model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with the cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered vulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices totally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical assessment of some flows within <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> cross-layered architecture. Our experiments indicate that little control is exercised by <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> Security Framework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we observed that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and sensitive security issues arise between <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> stack and <b>the</b> Linux kernel, thereby indicating that the attack surface of <b>the</b> <b>Android</b> platform is wider than expected.
