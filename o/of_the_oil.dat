5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters.

The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil,</b> in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
