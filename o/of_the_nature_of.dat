The researcher examined the primary source public debates from 1787 - 1789. This study identified <b>the</b> Statesmen’s view <b>of</b> leadership, which emerged from their writings and debates. Their assumptions were classified into assumptions on <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> man, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> government, and <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> society. <b>The</b> Statesmen’s views were then compared and contrasted to contemporary leadership literature...|$|R

5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, but because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> matter, {{which states that}} matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.

The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
