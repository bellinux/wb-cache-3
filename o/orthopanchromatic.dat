5|$|The Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey holds around 1,000 {{photographs}} taken for test purposes {{during the development}} of Michel's camera. Most of the photos were taken with 16mm <b>orthopanchromatic</b> Agfa film with a speed of ISO 8/10°. The exposed format was 10mm × 34mm. The quality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification. In the catalog of the 2007 exhibition Des pigeons photographes? they are classified as test photos {{on the ground or}} from a window, human perspectives from the ground or from elevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of relatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a plane, and {{only a small number of}} typical pigeon photographs.|$|E
