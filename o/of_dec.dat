Today {{it is the second}} largest French beef breed, behind Charolais and ahead of Blonde d'Aquitaine. In 2004, of about 900,000 Limousin cows, 63,000 were recorded in the Herd Book. At that time, 20,000 bulls were used for breeding, 10% through artificial insemination, and 1,600 were recorded in the Herd Book.

25|$|The Alpha {{architecture}} was sold, {{along with}} most parts <b>of</b> <b>DEC,</b> to Compaq in 1998. Compaq, already an Intel customer, decided to phase out Alpha {{in favor of the}} forthcoming Hewlett-Packard/Intel Itanium architecture, and sold all Alpha intellectual property to Intel in 2001, effectively killing the product. Hewlett-Packard purchased Compaq later that same year, continuing development of the existing product line until 2004, and selling Alpha-based systems, largely to the existing customer base, until April 2007.|$|E
25|$|Alpha, {{originally}} {{known as}} Alpha AXP, is a 64-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), designed to replace their 32-bit VAX {{complex instruction set computer}} (CISC) ISA. Alpha was implemented in microprocessors originally developed and fabricated by DEC. These microprocessors were most prominently {{used in a}} variety <b>of</b> <b>DEC</b> workstations and servers, which eventually formed the basis for almost all of their mid-to-upper-scale lineup. Several third-party vendors also produced Alpha systems, including PC form factor motherboards.|$|E

25|$|Although X10 offered {{interesting}} and powerful functionality, {{it had become}} obvious that the X protocol could use a more hardware-neutral redesign before it became too widely deployed, but MIT alone {{would not have the}} resources available for such a complete redesign. As it happened, DEC's Western Software Laboratory found itself between projects with an experienced team. Smokey Wallace <b>of</b> <b>DEC</b> WSL and Jim Gettys proposed that DEC WSL build X11 and make it freely available under the same terms as X9 and X10. This process started in May 1986, with the protocol finalized in August. Alpha testing of the software started in February 1987, beta-testing in May; the release of X11 finally occurred on 15 September 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{first few}} {{generations of the}} Alpha chips {{were some of the}} most {{innovative}} of their time. The first version, the Alpha 21064 or EV4, was the first CMOS microprocessor whose operating frequency rivalled higher-powered ECL minicomputers and mainframes. The second, 21164 or EV5, was the first microprocessor to place a large secondary cache on chip. The third, 21264 or EV6, was the first microprocessor to combine both high operating frequency and the more complicated out-of-order execution microarchitecture. The 21364 or EV7 was the first high performance processor to have an on-chip memory controller. The unproduced 21464 or EV8 would have been the first to include simultaneous multithreading, but this version was canceled after the sale <b>of</b> <b>DEC</b> to Compaq. The Tarantula research project, which most likely would have been called EV9, would have been the first Alpha processor to feature a vector unit.|$|E

40|$|Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) are an {{interesting}} class of active materials that can exhibit coupled electrical and mechanical behaviors, for example they can respond to an external electric field by changing their shape or size. This unique property is known as electrostriction, and makes such materials promising candidates {{for a wide range}} of practical applications, and therefore there is a need for the design of DEs with enhanced electromechanical couplings. In this work we investigate the possibility of enhancing the electrostriction by making composites consisting of one or more family of filler phases in a soft dielectric host. ^ We use homogenization techniques to obtain estimates for the effective response <b>of</b> such <b>DECs</b> under general electrical and mechanical loading conditions. Next, we use the homogenization estimates developed in this work to investigate the effect of various microstructural parameters on the overall response <b>of</b> <b>DECs.</b> We also study failure <b>of</b> <b>DECs</b> as characterized by dielectric breakdown and/or the onset of material instabilities. Two types of material instabilities will be considered: Loss of Positive Definiteness (LPD) and Loss of Ellipticity (LE). Finally, we attempt an optimal design for the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>DECs</b> with enhanced electromechanical couplings, which are capable of achieving large electrostrictive strains before the failure. Our results show that composites consisting of a very small concentration of rigid circular fibers with vanishing contrast in the dielectric properties can achieve the largest electrostrictive strains before failure. ^ Finally, we attempt to study DECs in the post-bifurcated deformation regime. This is important since after the composite loses strong ellipticity, the solution of the homogenization problem may bifurcate into a lower energy (with generally softer mechanical response) solution, which is different from the pre-bifurcated solutions. This raises the interesting possibility <b>of</b> operating <b>DECs</b> in their softer post-bifurcated deformation regimes to further increase the maximum achievable electrostrictive strains. ...|$|R
