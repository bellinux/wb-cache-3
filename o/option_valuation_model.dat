The {{supply and demand}} estimation finds the cherry price and cherry supply relationship in Wasco County to be significant and negative. A discounted cash flow (DCF) <b>valuation</b> <b>model</b> and a real <b>options</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>model</b> are used to value four investment scenarios.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on equity index <b>option</b> <b>valuation</b> largely focuses on affine models because they lead to closed-form solutions for option prices. This paper investigates the empirical biases associated with affine models, using data on S&P 500 call options.

40|$|This paper uses an <b>option</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>model</b> of {{the firm}} to answer the question, "What {{magnitude}} tax advantage to debt {{is consistent with the}} range of observed corporate debt ratios?" We incorporate into the model differential personal tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income. We conclude that variations in the magnitude of bankruptcy costs across firms can not by itself account for the simultaneous existence of levered and unlevered firms. When it is possible for the value of the underlying assets to junip discretely to zero, differences across firms in the probability of this jump can account for the simultaneous existence of levered and unlevered firms. Moreover, if the tax advantage to debt is small, the annual rate of return advantage offered by optimal leverage may be so small as to make the firm indifferent about debt policy over a wide range of debt-to-firm value ratios. ...|$|E

40|$|Equilibrium in {{the market}} for real assets {{requires}} that the price of those assets be bid up to reflect the tax shields they can offer to levered firms. Thus there must be an equality between the market values of real assets and the values of optimally levered firms. The standard measure of the advantage to leverage compares the values of levered and unlevered assets, and can be misleading and difficult to interpret. We show that a meaningful measure of the advantage to debt is the extra rate of return, net of a market premium for bankruptcy risk, earned by a levered firm relative to an otherwise-identical unlevered firm. We construct an <b>option</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>model</b> to calculate such a measure and present extensive simulation results.
