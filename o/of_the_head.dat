5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E

5|$|The front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of {{the female}} in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and {{the area around the}} ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder {{of the female}} breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|The sand devil has a flattened, {{moderately}} {{narrow body}} with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with smooth edges. There are five pairs of gill slits located on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E

5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect one half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E

5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in {{the centre of the}} labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} place near the shrine is the Urgyan Tsemo, the “Peak of Urgyan” {{which has a}} small Mani Lakhang. The prayer wheel, turned by an old monk, resounds with chimes that are heard every day at 4 am. Above the Urgyan is the holy cave temple known as 'Phaphug Lakhang' (dPal-phug IHa-khang), which is the main shrine of the Taktshang. It is also the residence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Head</b> Lama, Karma Thupden Chokyi Nyenci.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow {{on the front end}} and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
