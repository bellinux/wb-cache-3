25|$|Oat {{beta-glucan}} is a viscous polysaccharide made up {{of units}} of the monosaccharide D-glucose. Oat beta-glucan is composed of mixed-linkage polysaccharides. This means the bonds between the D-glucose or D-glucopyranosyl units are either beta-1, 3 linkages or beta-1, 4 linkages. This type of beta-glucan is {{also referred to as}} a mixed-linkage (1→3), (1→4)-beta-D-glucan. The (1→3)-linkages break up the uniform structure of the beta-D-glucan molecule and make it soluble and flexible. In comparison, the indigestible polysaccharide cellulose is also a beta-glucan, but is not soluble because of its (1→4)-beta-D-linkages. The percentages of beta-glucan in the various whole oat products are: <b>oat</b> <b>bran,</b> having from 5.5% to 23.0%; rolled oats, about 4%; and whole oat flour about 4%.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{consumption}} of fibrous foods has been stimulated in recent years. While wheat and <b>oat</b> <b>brans</b> {{are still the}} conventional sources of fiber for human consumption, other new fibrous products have been developed – at research level – from waste or by-products generated by food industries. This research aimed {{to develop a new}} dehydrated food product- peach palm fibrous flour- from the waste generated during the processing of the heart-of-peach palm. The average yield in dry weight from this waste into farinaceous products was 129. 8 g kg- 1. The flours showed high values for the total dietary fiber, 59. 1 to 65. 5 g 100 g- 1, almost entirely represented by the insoluble fiber, as well as a low proportion of calories- 96. 1 to 101. 1 kcal or 408. 2 - 429. 5 kJ per 100 g of product- when compared to wheat bran.

40|$|This {{study used}} {{polysaccharide}} degrading enzymes and protein precipitation to extract polyphenols from oats {{and to determine}} their bioactivity.

40|$|Six {{dietary fiber}} sources, wheat bran, corn <b>bran,</b> soy <b>bran,</b> <b>oat</b> hulls, rice <b>bran,</b> and {{cellulose}} were examined {{with regard to}} their abilities to bind copper, zinc, and iron. Their chemical composition, some of their physical properties, and their in vivo action on mineral status in tissues of chicks were investigated. Also, a comparison of the physicochemical properties of neutral detergent treated (NDF) and pepsin-pancreatin treated (EIR) residues was made. The release of endogenous copper, zinc, and iron from the fiber sources was pH dependent. Greater amounts of minerals were released into solution at pH 0. 65 than into solution at pH 6. 8. After a sequential treatment of pH 0. 65 solution, neutralization, then pH 6. 8 buffer, the mineral levels in the residues were similar to those remaining in the residues after the near neutral treatment. This indicated that the minerals were rebound after the pH of the solution was raised from acidic to near neutral. The amount of zinc in the residues from the sequential treatment correlated positively to protein and phytic acid contents and negatively to NDF and EIR contents. Neither copper nor iron showed any significant correlations. Hydrogen ion buffering capacities were determined for three preparations of the six fiber sources: (1) untreated, original material; (2) NDF-treated; and (3) EIR-treated materials. The buffering capacities were expressed as functions of the slopes of titration curves, where the smaller the slope, the greater the buffering capacity. The treated preparations had lower buffering capacities than did the untreated preparation. The treatments reduced the amounts of digestible/soluble components, especially protein in the fiber sources. Protein content was strongly correlated to buffering capacity for the untreated and the EIR-treated preparations but not for the NDF-treated preparation. Wheat <b>bran,</b> soy <b>bran,</b> <b>oat</b> hulls, and cellulose were subjected to NDF and EIR treatments, and the residues were used as column material for cation exchange experiments. A factorial experiment was performed using fibers by treatments by three solutions. The solutions were copper alone, zinc alone, and copper-zinc in combination. Cation exchange capacities (CEC) and protein contents were also determined. The CEC values for the residues from the two treatments for wheat bran and cellulose were similar but were very different for the soy bran (EIR-treated CEC was higher than NDF-treated) and oat hulls (NDF much greater than EIR). More mmoles of copper were bound than zinc whether presented alone or in equimolar combination. Protein content correlated to mmoles mineral bound for only the NDF-treated residues and only when the minerals were presented singly. These in vitro experiments demonstrated the intrinsic differences of the fiber sources. One fiber source may be beneficial to nutritional status while another may be detrimental. The fiber isolation technique produced residues with different compositions and different physical properties. Future biochemical investigations of dietary fiber must acknowledge the possible divergence from physiological reality which results from the isolation methodology. The chick feeding study used diets which had the fiber sources added to be equivalent to the addition of 6 % dietary fiber (as NDF). At this level, all the fiber sources, except rice bran, resulted in adequate growth and adequate deposition of tissue minerals. The chicks on the rice bran diet had lowered feed intakes, significantly reduced growth and significantly lower tibia zinc, iron, and manganese levels. One factor in the rice bran diet, which may have influenced the status of the chicks, was its phytic acid content which was the highest of the fiber sources. This in vivo experiment again indicates the dissimilarity in effects of the dietary fiber sources...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that dietary fiber’s protective effect {{against the development}} of colon cancer, diverticular disease, and atherosclerosis {{may be due to}} the adsorption and/or dilution of intestinal sterols such as bile acids and neutral sterols and their bacterial metabolites by component(s) of fiber. Dietary fiber is made up of four major components-cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. There is evidence that hemicellulose and pectin may induce an increase in fecal bile acid excretion in man which may be accompanied by a decrease in serum cholesterol. Natural fibers, such as rolled oats, alfalfa, guar gum, and Bengal gram have been shown to have hypocholesterolemic properties and alfalfa, wheat straw, and some other fibers bound considerable amounts of bile acids in vitro.

Moisture losses, water activity, crumb firmness, starch retrogradation, and sensorial characteristics were used as staling indicators. Avrami-type equations were efficiently used for modeling the starch retrogradation kinetics, while linear models most adequately described crumb firming kinetics. Cake staling induced an increase in crumb firmness and enthalpy of amylopectin retrogradation, {{and a decrease in}} crumb moisture and sensory quality and acceptability scores of cakes. Oat bran-containing cakes better maintained their characteristics compared to the ones containing rice bran along the 7 -d storage. Endoxylanase treatment of brans delayed the changes naturally induced during staling in crumb moisture content, amylopectin retrogradation enthalpy, and crumb firmness in the respective cakes.

40|$|Background: Cereal fiber is {{reported}} to be associated with obesity and metabolic diseases. However, whether cereal fiber improves leptin resistance and sensitivity remains unclear. Design: For 24 weeks, 48 male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were randomly given a normal chow diet (Chow), high-fat/cholesterol diet (HFD), HFD with 0. 8 % oat fiber (H-oat) or HFD with 0. 8 % wheat bran fiber (H-wheat). At the end of feeding period, both the serum insulin and leptin levels were determined by ELISA kits. Western blotting was used to assess the protein expressions of the leptin receptor (LepR) and the leptin-signaling pathway in the adipose tissues. Results: Our results suggested that mice fed <b>oat</b> or wheat <b>bran</b> fiber exhibited lower body weight, serum lipids, as well as insulin and leptin levels. The two cereal fibers potently increased the protein expressions of LepR in the adipose tissue.

Tortillas were prepared using a hot-press, gas-fired oven and were evaluated for physical properties, texture and shelf-stability. Objective and subjective tests demonstrated that whole white wheat and multigrain tortilla doughs were harder, rougher and less extensible than refined flour tortilla dough. Multigrain flour tortillas were thinner, larger and more translucent than the refined flour treatment. Incorporation of whole multigrain flours affected color of the product, giving darker tortillas. Tortilla flexibility decreased over time. After 16 days of storage rollability scores of tortillas decreased drastically. The most pronounced decrease in tortilla flexibility was observed for 5 % sorghum bran, 10 % buckwheat, and for the treatment prepared with of 5 % flax, 5 % sorghum, 5 % oat, 5 % buckwheat. The flexibility loss was higher for whole white wheat and multigrain tortillas than for the refined one which was confirmed with objective and subjective tests. To extend shelf stability of whole multigrain tortillas various amounts of commercial hydrocolloid and ?-amylase were added to the formulation. Tortillas with 75 ppm, 100 ppm of ?-amylase, 1 % and 1. 5 % of gum retained their flexibility during 16 days of storage. Consumer acceptability of the whole multigrain tortillas (5 % flaxseed, 5 % sorghum <b>bran,</b> 5 % <b>oat,</b> 5 % buckwheat) was compared with commercial multigrain tortillas and whole white wheat flour tortillas using an untrained sensory panel.

40|$|Nutritionally {{adequate}} diets fed to pigs can {{be expected}} to yield varied responses due to physical attribute differences, feeding and processing methods, ingredient selection and other factors. Independent and interrelated effects of such dietary characteristics are of special interest where feed intake control in self-fed pigs is of prime economic importance. Evidence is provided in this thesis that rate of gain, feed conversion and carcass quality can be influenced by nature and texture of fibrous ration ingredients, pelleting, antibiotic supplementation and pig sex. A 3 x 25 factorially arranged swine feeding experi­ment was conducted with finishing rations to assess the effects of: three fibrous diluents (cellulose, wheat <b>bran,</b> <b>oat</b> hulls), two or three daily feedings, two fiber moduli, pelleting, antibiotic supplementation and sex (gilt vs. barrow) comparisons. Response criteria included weight, gains, feed intake and con­version, energy and protein digestibility coefficients, carcass traits, gastrointestinal weights, and chemical and physical measurements upon the ingesta from selected gastrointestinal segments. Ingesta assessment included specific gravity, Klasson lignin, proximate principle components, and ingestal fluid physical characteristics. Treatments increasing daily feed intake included oat hulls, three daily feedings, fine moduli, pelleting or barrows. Growth rate increased only in barrows or pellet-fed groups. Cellulose or antibiotic supplementation improved feed conversion, whereas oat hulls impaired it. Oat hulls depressed digestible energy coefficients but increased protein digestibility. Both energy and protein digestibility coefficients were improved by antibiotic supplementation; however, both bulk type and moduli exerted an influence on this response. Module effects were many and varied; the finer module generally increased feed intakes and conversion. It was noteworthy that fine wheat bran failed to exhibit many characteristic responses of wheat bran. This effect was attributed to destruction of the physical form in bran, namely "flakiness". Carcass quality paralleled nutrient digestibility and feed intake alterations. The degree of finish, as in­fluenced by fibrous diluent type, feeding frequency or sex, was associated with carcass yield. It was postulated that fluid retention differences in the gut, primarily between fibrous diluent sources, influenced the relative degree of tissue hydration and thereby affected carcass yield. Changes in carcass yield were associated with visceral weight differ­ences observed on fibrous diluent or antibiotic comparisons. Gastric density characteristics reflected attributes of dry feed. Pelleted, fine module or antibiotic-fortified feed increased, gastric density but this effect became dissi­pated in the intestinal regions. It is possible that appetite inducing effects of these treatments were manifested in terms of stomach filling capacity. Ingesta differences attributable to fibrous diluent sources were maintained throughout the tract. The most voluminous ingesta source was wheat bran and the least, oat hulls. In terms of dry matter percentage, oat hull ingesta was the highest and wheat bran the lowest. Larger quantities of ingesta occurred in the rectal segment of oat ­hull fed animals. It was postulated that this affect reflected ingesta volume differences upon lumen distention and defecation initiation. Although dry matter and ingestal fluid physical measurement differences prevailed, these were difficult to correlate with animal performance and ration utilization. In­creased fat levels were present in rectal samples from animals fed wheat bran. Antibiotic supplementation increased ingestal fluid pH and viscosity, but tended to reduce surface tension. The large number of significant high order inter­actions rendered specific interpretation difficult, but such findings emphasize the important role that physical character­istics of the diet play in determining growth and development of animals fed nutritionally balanced rations...|$|R
