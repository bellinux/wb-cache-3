5|$|For medieval writers, the {{two most}} {{influential}} ancient sources on the Trojan War were the purported eye-witness accounts of Dares the Phrygian, and Dictys the Cretan, which both survive in Latin versions. In Western Europe the Trojan side {{of the war was}} favoured and therefore Dares was preferred over Dictys. Although Dictys' account positions Troilus' death later in the war than was traditional, it conforms to antiquity's view of him as a minor warrior if <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Dares' De excidio Trojae historia (History of the Fall of Troy) introduces the character as a hero who takes part in events beyond the story of his death.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

25|$|In some societies, people {{sleep with}} at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals. In other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except for an {{intimate}} partner. In almost all societies, sleeping partners are strongly regulated by social standards.

25|$|Radbod died in 719. Charles seized West Frisia {{without any}} great {{resistance}} {{on the part}} of the Frisians, who had been subjects of the Franks but had rebelled upon the death of Pippin. When Chilperic II died the following year (720), Charles appointed as his successor the son of Dagobert III, Theuderic IV, who was still a minor, and who occupied the throne from 720 to 737. Charles was now appointing the kings whom he supposedly served, rois fainéants who were mere figureheads; by the end of his reign he didn't appoint <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> At this time, Charles again marched against the Saxons. Then the Neustrians rebelled under Ragenfrid, who had left the county of Anjou. They were easily defeated (724), but Ragenfrid gave up his sons as hostages in turn for keeping his county. This ended the civil wars of Charles' reign.|$|E

Privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data {{could be used for}} targeted advertising, and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users. In response to these claims, Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users, that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy, and that the console would not redistribute user-generated content without permission. In response to these pre-launch changes and a belief that Microsoft's decisions for the systems were in poor judgement, journalists and consumers jokingly gave Xbox One nicknames such as [...] "Xbox 180", in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft's decision to reverse its controversial decisions, and [...] "Xbone", suggesting that the company was [...] "throwing a bone" [...] to consumers by making these changes.|$|E
500|$|A simple {{majority}} vote sufficed until 1179, when the Third Council of the Lateran increased the required majority to two-thirds. As cardinals {{were not allowed}} to vote for themselves (after 1621), the ballots were designed to ensure secrecy {{while at the same time}} preventing self-voting. In 1945 Pope Pius XII removed the prohibition on a cardinal voting for himself, increasing the requisite majority to two-thirds plus <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times. His successor John XXIII immediately overturned this change, reinstating the two-thirds majority if the number of cardinal electors voting is divisible by three, with a rounding up to two-thirds plus one otherwise. Paul VI reinstated Pius XII's procedure thirteen years later, but John Paul II overturned it again. In 1996, John Paul II's constitution allowed election by absolute majority if deadlock prevailed after thirty-three or thirty-four ballots (thirty-four ballots if a ballot took place on the first afternoon of the conclave). In 2007 [...] Benedict XVI rescinded John Paul II's change (which had been criticised as effectively abolishing the two-thirds majority requirement, as any majority would suffice to block the election until a {{simple majority}} was enough to elect the next pope), reaffirming the requirement of a two-thirds majority.|$|E
500|$|As {{important}} as these improvements were, {{they could not}} compete {{with the impact of}} the railway. German economist Friedrich List called the railways and the Customs Union [...] "Siamese Twins", emphasizing their important relationship to one another. He was not alone: the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote a poem in which he extolled the virtues of the Zollverein, which he began with a list of commodities that had contributed more to German unity than politics or diplomacy. Historians of the Second Empire later regarded the railways as the first indicator of a unified state; the patriotic novelist, Wilhelm Raabe, wrote: [...] "The German empire was founded with the construction of the first railway..." [...] Not everyone greeted the iron monster with enthusiasm. The Prussian king Frederick William III saw no advantage in traveling from Berlin to Potsdam a few hours faster, and Metternich refused to ride in <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Others wondered if the railways were an [...] "evil" [...] that threatened the landscape: Nikolaus Lenau's 1838 poem An den Frühling (To Spring) bemoaned the way trains destroyed the pristine quietude of German forests.|$|E

500|$|When Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{ends up in}} a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) makes Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{the interim}} {{regional}} manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style {{in stark contrast to}} their previously relaxed style, from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called [...] "The Fist". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), causing him temporary hearing loss. Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying [...] "Shagedelic, baby") at certain promptings.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sister Mary Johnson, Sister Patricia Wittberg, and Mary Gautier, in New {{generations of}} Catholic Sisters:Some commentators, for ideological purposes, {{attempt to create}} {{generalized}} typologies that mask {{the complexity of the}} religious reality, arguing that all new entrants go to traditionalist (CMSWR [...] ) institutes and few or none go to LCWR [...] institutes. … The reality of the situation is that almost an equal percentage of LCWR and CMSWR institutes have no <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in formation at the present time (32 percent and 27 percent, respectively).

2500|$|An early {{advocate}} of the photoengraving process over wood engraving for magazine reproduction of illustrative art, Remington became an accepted expert in reproduction methods, which helped gain him strong working relationships with editors and printers. Furthermore, Remington's skill as a businessman was equal to his artistry, unlike many other artists who relied on their spouses or business agents or no <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to run their financial affairs.

2500|$|In May 2006 a record-shattering 517-move endgame was {{announced}} (see first diagram). [...] Marc Bourzutschky found it using a program written by Yakov Konoval. [...] Black's first move is 1... Rd7+ and White wins the rook in 517 moves. This was determined using the easier-to-calculate [...] method, which {{assumes that the}} two sides are aiming respectively to reduce the game to a simpler won ending or to delay that conversion. Such endgames do not necessarily represent strictly optimal play from both sides, as Black may delay checkmate by allowing an earlier conversion or White may accelerate it by delaying a conversion (or not making <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all).</b> In September 2009, {{it was found that the}} distance to mate (not conversion) in a similar position to the Bourzutschky–Konoval position was 545 (see diagram). The same researchers later confirmed that this (along with variations of it) is the longest 7-man pawnless endgame, and that, with pawns, the longest 7-man endgame is the one depicted in the second diagram. White takes 6 moves to promote the pawn to a Knight, after which it takes another 543 moves to win the game.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy {{wondered}} if {{there could be a}} further twist where one of the five named suspects is not the culprit, as the BBC said there would be [...] "at least" [...] five.

And when they're done and done good, they're very, very good. It would actually be the one affair we'd understand Kat's motivation for." [...] Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Max's daughter Lauren Branning, said that the cast were so [...] "desperate" [...] to know who Kat's lover was that she tricked them into believing it was Peter Andre, saying, [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> knows who Kat's having the affair with, we're all talking about it on set. Some people have started winding other people up saying they've been told but they won't say who it is. I started a rumour around the set {{that it would be a}} celebrity guest appearance. I said it would be Peter Andre and some of the new cast believed it as well!" [...] Tony Discipline, who plays Michael's half-brother Tyler Moon, {{wondered if}} Kat's lover could actually be a woman. However, Digital Spy reported that episodes in September 2012 would make it [...] "pretty much certain" [...] that Kat's lover is one of the named suspects.

2500|$|Williamson {{was told}} early on by his agent, Rob Paris, that the {{saturation}} {{of violence and}} gore in his script would make it [...] "impossible" [...] to sell and following its purchase by Miramax he was required to remove much of the gorier scenes. However, once Craven was confirmed to direct, {{he was able to}} bring much of the excised content back. Williamson intended to remove a scene in the film that took place inside the fictional school's bathroom, feeling it was awkward but Craven salvaged it believing it had potential. Williamson later confirmed that he was glad Craven did so. The death of the character Principal Himbry was added at the request of producer Bob Weinstein who noted that there was thirty pages (thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder occurring. This later aided Williamson who was struggling to find motivation for characters to leave a party in the film's finale, now able to use the discovered corpse of the Himbry character. When writing the finale, Williamson was unsure what to cite as a motivation for the killers or whether to give them <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Opinions were split between staff on the picture, some who felt that a motive was necessary for the audience to be given resolution while others felt it was scarier without one. Ultimately Williamson decided to do both, giving the character Billy Loomis the motive of maternal abandonment while not giving the character of Stu Macher one, instead having the character jokingly suggest [...] "peer pressure".|$|E
