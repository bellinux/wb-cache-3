5|$|Early on May 18, an {{earthquake}} measuring 5.1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale</b> struck the region, creating a massive landslide—- of rock that released {{pressure on the}} volcano's crater, causing an ejection of steam. Just seconds later, Mount St. Helens erupted laterally, sending supersonic pyroclastic flows into the forest below.|$|E

5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>Scale</b> occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>Scale</b> and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
5|$|Striking the Autonomous Region of Azores on 1 January, the 1980 Azores Island {{earthquake}} killed 61 {{people and}} injured over 400, causing severe {{damage on the}} islands of Terceira and São Jorge. Measuring 7.2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale,</b> it also shook the islands of Pico and Faial, and resulted from a strike slip fracture, typical of other historical Azorean earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} that struck the Azorean islands was a magnitude 7.2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale.</b> It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% {{of the houses}} on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Heroísmo. In general, public buildings such as churches remained intact, while several buildings caved in on themselves. Public utilities such as electricity and water, were reported cut in several areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen forest with commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red loamy soil is also found. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV Seismic Zone, having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale</b> on February 8, 1900.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale</b> would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the Meiji period, Gifu was officially {{established}} as a city on July 1, 1889, with an original population of 25,750 people and an area of 10km². On October 28, 1891, two years later, the Mino–Owari earthquake occurred, estimated at 8 magnitude <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>Scale.</b> About 37% of the city was lost to fire, resulting in 1,505 casualties (245 dead, 1,260 injured) and 6,336 buildings affected (3,993 of which were completely destroyed). As a result, Gifu erected the first Earthquake Memorial Hall in all of Japan, which holds memorial services for the victims on the 28th of every month.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale,</b> and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.|$|E
50|$|Earthquakes {{occurred}} at the seamount between 1998 and 2004 and shook the island of Brava. The last earthquake measured at 4.3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude <b>scale.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was recorded}} as 5.8 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude <b>scale</b> (5.3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moment magnitude scale) {{and a maximum}} intensity of VII (Very strong) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mercalli intensity scale.|$|R

5|$|The DWS has functioned {{successfully}} {{since its}} initial operation in 2007. The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>Scale</b> with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Xinshi Tainan (台南新市) and six trains were {{stopped on the}} track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was well noted, and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global railway industry.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last {{period of activity}} in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale.</b> A total of 174 shocks of magnitude2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 2005 an {{aftershock}} measuring 6.7 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> <b>scale</b> {{struck the}} west coast of Sumatra two weeks after a larger earthquake struck Nias. This caused crackage to the columns supporting the mosque's roof. Three years later, the Ganting Grand Mosque was one of 608 places of worship severely damaged when another large earthquake struck the area on 30 September 2009. The earthquake collapsed part of the mosque's façade and caused severe structural damage to the interior columns; as a result, the community feared that the mosque would collapse. Before renovations were completed in 2010, prayers had to be held in the yard. In 2011 the Ganting Grand Mosque was listed as one of Indonesia's 100 most beautiful mosques in a book compiled by Andalan Media. The only other mosque from West Sumatra included was Raya Bayur Mosque, Agam Regency.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral {{suffered}} {{further damage}} from the swarm of earthquakes <b>on</b> 23 December, <b>the</b> largest measuring 6.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude <b>scale,</b> during which {{what remained of the}} rose window collapsed.|$|R

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in dry and warm weather conditions. Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 38.474 seconds, ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard. Barrichello set the fourth quickest time and caused the session to be yellow flagged when he lost control of his car and spun at the hairpin between turns ten and eleven and crashed into the perimeter fencing. Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella. Frentzen and Jarno Trulli set the seventh and ninth fastest times respectively for Jordan; they were separated by Jaguar's Eddie Irvine. Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR completed the top ten despite spinning off the circuit which caused grass to penetrate his radiators. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:37.728, six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello had trouble selecting first gear on his final run although he set the third quickest time. Coulthard was fourth fastest, ahead of Button. Frentzen and Trulli continued their good form setting the sixth and seventh fastest times. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta completed the top ten fastest drivers. During the session, an earthquake measuring 7.1 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>richter</b> <b>scale</b> was felt at Suzuka, although no structural damage was reported around the circuit despite mild alarm.|$|E
