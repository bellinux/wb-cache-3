25|$|Turbochargers {{are also}} {{employed}} in certain two-stroke cycle diesel engines, which would normally require a Roots blower for aspiration. In this specific application, mainly Electro-Motive diesel (EMD) 567, 645, and 710 Series engines, the turbocharger is initially {{driven by the}} engine's crankshaft through a gear train and an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch,</b> thereby providing aspiration for combustion. After combustion has been achieved, and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy, the <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> is automatically disengaged, and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases. In the EMD application, the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true turbocharging during medium and high power output settings. This is particularly beneficial at high altitudes, as are often encountered on western U.S. railroads. It is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{problem of}} {{changing}} from first to second gear is that two bands must actuate in synchronism: the planet {{support of the}} second gearset must release {{at the same time}} as the sun band is actuated. As a result, this is a gear change that tends to be rougher than the others, where just one band is released or actuated. This also means more wear in auto box parts. This is solved by the use of one-way <b>overrun</b> <b>clutches</b> which allow one or more components to [...] "free wheel" [...] when the transmission shifts into a higher gear. GM's Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 and 400 transmissions utilized <b>overrun</b> <b>clutches</b> in both the low and intermediate gears, allowing for fully progressive shifting with no [...] "overlap".|$|R
50|$|The THM400 was {{the first}} three-speed, Simpson-geared {{automatic}} to use <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutches</b> for both first and second gear reaction, a feature that eliminated the need to coordinate the simultaneous release of a band and application of a clutch to make the 2-3 gear change. Owing to this feature, {{as well as the}} use of a large, multi-plate clutch to provide second gear reaction, the THM400 is able to withstand very high input torque and an enormous number of shifting cycles, as would be encountered in frequent stop-and-go driving. As a result, it has met with considerable success in commercial vehicle applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{turbocharger}} was the then-new EMD mechanically assisted turbo-compressor. During engine startup, and {{at lower}} power levels, during {{which there is}} not sufficient exhaust heat energy to drive the turbine fast enough for the compressor to supply the air necessary for combustion, the engine drives the compressor through a gear train and an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch.</b> At higher power levels, the <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> is disengaged, and the turbo-compressor operates as a true turbocharger. It is possible for the turbo-compressor to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power. Turbocharging provides higher horsepower and good running characteristics at all altitudes. Turbocharging also improves fuel consumption and reduces emissions.|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} or automotive engineering, a freewheel or <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{a device}} in a transmission that disengages the driveshaft from the driven shaft when the driven shaft rotates {{faster than the}} driveshaft. An overdrive is sometimes mistakenly called a freewheel, but is otherwise unrelated.|$|E
50|$|In {{agricultural}} equipment an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> is typically used on hay balers {{and other equipment}} with a high inertial load, particularly when {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor without a live power take-off (PTO). Without a live PTO, a high inertial load can cause the tractor to continue to move forward even when the foot clutch is depressed, creating an unsafe condition. By disconnecting the load from the PTO under these conditions, the <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> improves safety. Similarly, many unpowered 'push' cylinder lawnmowers use a freewheel to drive the blades: these are geared or chain-driven to rotate at high speed and the freewheel prevents their momentum being transferred in the reverse direction through the drive when the machine is halted.|$|E
50|$|A {{freewheel}} assembly is also {{widely used}} on engine starters {{as a kind}} of protective device. Starter motors usually need to spin at 3,000 RPM to get the engine to turn over. When the key is held in the start position for any amount of time after the engine has started, the starter can not spin fast enough {{to keep up with the}} flywheel. Because of the extreme gear ratio between starter gear and flywheel (about 15 or 20:1) it would spin the starter armature at dangerously high speeds, causing an explosion when the centripetal force acting on the copper coils wound in the armature can no longer resist the outward force acting on them. In starters without the freewheel or <b>overrun</b> <b>clutch</b> this would be a major problem because, with the flywheel spinning at about 1,000 RPM at idle, the starter, if engaged with the flywheel, would be forced to spin between 15,000 and 20,000 RPM. Once the engine has turned over and is running, the <b>overrun</b> <b>clutch</b> will release the starter from the flywheel and prevent the gears from re-meshing (as in an accidental turning of the ignition key) while the engine is running. A freewheel clutch is now used in many motorcycles with an electric starter motor. It is used as a replacement for the Bendix drive used on most auto starters because it reduces the electrical needs of the starting system.|$|R

40|$|Reactive {{power is}} an {{unwanted}} but unavoidable part of alternating current {{electric power delivery}} systems. Governed {{by the laws of}} physics, it occurs due to the inherent nature of the components of these systems. This article develops an understanding of reactive power and the control of it to reduce its adverse effects and to improve the efficiency of an electric power delivery system. The article begins by identifying and representing electric power circuit components, real power, and reactive power. These are then mathematically shown how they interact and affect the power delivery system. Control and mitigation of the effects of reactive power are then developed with emphasis on mechanical solutions using rotating machines. In particular, peaking or retired generators are identified for use as rotating condensers as well as new installations. A description of the gear type synchronous self-synchronizing (SSS) <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutches</b> used to connect and dis-connect a generator from the peaking prime mover or the retired generator from a starting system is included...|$|R
5000|$|A {{sprag clutch}} {{is used in}} most older {{automatic}} transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one clutch with the disengagement of another. Using an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> instead of a hydraulically actuated one makes this synchronization automatic. The sprag clutch simply [...] "lets go" [...] once the reaction force it provides is no longer needed.|$|E
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> disengages.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} a sealed wave power {{generator}} has been proposed, whose driving parts are sealed in a closed outer covering {{to protect them from}} corrosion by sea water. Wave energy is collected using a pendulum. <b>Overrunning</b> roller <b>clutches</b> are used to convert the swing of the pendulum to unidirectional rotation of generators. A design method based on the Principle of Conservation of Energy has been proposed. A guide plate is equipped on the platform where the wave power generator sits on, to ensure the swing plane of the pendulum parallel to the main vibration plane of the wave. Power processing circuit has also been equipped, which can perform automatic current and voltage regulation under the condition of large variation of wave height and cycle. Experiments have demonstrated that the sealed wave power generator is applicable...|$|R
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an <b>overrunning</b> sprag <b>clutch</b> which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
50|$|Overdrive units {{manufactured}} by Laycock de Normanville used a freewheel (also called <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch)</b> {{to facilitate a}} smooth gear change between locked mode (1:1) and overdrive mode without use of the conventional clutch pedal. The freewheel would lock the outgoing axle to the outgoing axle in the brief transition period between the conical clutch for locked mode disengaging and the clutch for overdrive mode engaging.|$|E

This is an impulse turbine impacted by burning gases from a cartridge, usually created by igniting a solid propellant similar to gunpowder. It is geared to rotate the engine and also connected to an automatic disconnect system, or <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch.</b> The cartridge is set alight electrically and used to turn the starter's turbine.|$|E

50|$|The all {{wheel drive}} system enables itself {{automatically}} using a roller-type <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> if the wheel slip is greater than 7-8%. The front axle is same as in the IFA W50 LA, this results in less ground clearance compared to the rear wheel drive ZT 300 tractors. As well as the rear axle, the AWD front axle has a lockable differential. The ZT 305 also has brakes for the front wheels, bigger tyres and rear twin tyres, it was developed for slopes with gradients of up to 45 %.|$|E
50|$|In a torque {{converter}} {{there are at}} least three rotating elements: the impeller, which is mechanically driven by the prime mover; the turbine, which drives the load; and the stator, which is interposed between the impeller and turbine so that it can alter oil flow returning from the turbine to the impeller. The classic {{torque converter}} design dictates that the stator be prevented from rotating under any condition, hence the term stator. In practice, however, the stator is mounted on an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch,</b> which prevents the stator from counter-rotating with respect to the prime mover but allows forward rotation.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Saab {{drivetrain}} was a 'freewheel' (<b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch).</b> This allowed the transmission to run faster than the engine, such as when decelerating, or descending a long hill. Although such freewheels had been provided in other cars before as an economy measure, they were required in the Saab because of the limited lubrication in the two-stroke engine. A petroil-lubricated two-stroke requires lubrication according to its speed, but provides this lubrication according {{to the amount of}} its throttle opening. Where the engine operates at high RPM and low throttle (such as when coasting down a long hill), the lubrication provided may be inadequate. With the freewheel, a coasting engine could reduce its speed to idling, thus requiring only the small lubrication available from the closed, coasting, throttle. In certain higher-performance models and in later two-stroke models, direct injection of oil into the engine from a separate reservoir allowed lubrication to be a function of engine RPM and rendered mixing of oil with gasoline unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|The Trabant 601 was {{a modern}} {{automobile}} when introduced in 1963, with 150 Pre-Production examples. The body was modified {{from the previous}} P50/P60 variants of the Trabant, with a heavy emphasis {{on the front and}} roof area. The back of the car was also modified with different taillights and a higher trunk loading height as compared to previous models. Overall the design was praised, particularly on the then modern double trapezoid design. Originally production was planned to run from 1967 to 1971, but in practice continued until 1990.The original engine was only 17 kW (23 hp), but in 1969 a new version was offered with a 19.1 kW (26 hp) engine. In 1974 a Needle roller bearing was added to the connecting rod, allowing for a 50/1 lubricant to be used. Through the addition of a 2-stage carburetor in 1984, the fuel consumption was brought down by 1/100 l/km. With these additions, the top speed measured was measured to be 107 km/h. Even with these improvements the fuel consumption could still rise rapidly with extended acceleration or when towing a trailer. The P601 also had an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> when running in 4th gear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is one of}} the {{critical}} components that can engage and disengage according to the movement requirement of the power system and the rotor system.

The device comprises a shape memory alloy wire wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum contrasted by a backup beam spring and fitted to the output shaft through an <b>overrunning</b> <b>clutch.</b> Electrical heating produces a contraction of the wire, hence a rotation of the drum which is transferred to the shaft.
