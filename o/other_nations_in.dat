60|$|I {{insist that}} the trade of England is greater and more {{considerable}} than that of any <b>other</b> <b>nation,</b> for these reasons: 1. Because England produces more goods as well for home consumption as for foreign exportation, and those goods all made of its own produce or manufactured by its own inhabitants, than any <b>other</b> <b>nation</b> <b>in</b> the world. 2. Because England consumes within itself more goods of foreign growth, imported from the several countries where they are produced or wrought, than any <b>other</b> <b>nation</b> <b>in</b> the world. And--3. Because for the doing this England employs more shipping and more seamen than any <b>other</b> <b>nation,</b> and, some think, than all the <b>other</b> <b>nations,</b> of Europe.|$|R

5|$|The cyclone was {{considered}} the worst disaster in Oman during the 20th century, and remains the deadliest cyclone as of 2010. Overall, the cyclone caused 105deaths, and over 5,000injuries, and left about 20,000people homeless. The death toll is disputed, as another report indicated 110deaths in Oman. After the storm, neighboring Saudi Arabia sent assistance to Oman, as did <b>other</b> <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> the Persian Gulf. The cyclone struck before the nation created a coordinated disaster network in 1988; as a result, the relief work was spread among various agencies.|$|E

Poland was more active than <b>other</b> <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial. On 25 November 1947, the Auschwitz Trial began in Kraków, when Poland's Supreme National Tribunal brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant Arthur Liebehenschel, women's camp leader Maria Mandel, and camp leader Hans Aumeier. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 life sentences, and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years.

5|$|The {{drive for}} decimalisation of the {{currency}} in Britain dates {{as far back as}} 1682. Although nothing was done regarding early proposals, the adoption of a decimal currency in the United States, France and <b>other</b> <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for its adoption. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir John Bowring calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the striking of coins of one-tenth and one-hundredth of a pound. Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the Russell government promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of a pound (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration in future to be given to the introduction of other decimal coins.|$|E
5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the <b>other</b> <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about the mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch Anise, who is planting the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E
5|$|For Germany, {{the final}} result meant that, for the fourth {{straight}} time, they were positioned among the tournament's top 3 teams; moreover, the victory allowed the Germans {{to become the first}} side to reach eight World Cup finals. The match was a record 12th time a German team played in a semi-final. Germany became the first team to score 7 goals in a World Cup semi-final. The last time a team scored six goals was West Germany in 1954 versus Austria, same as in both semi-finals in 1930. It was Germany's highest half-time lead in a World Cup match, with their previous best being 4–0 against Saudi Arabia in 2002, the match finished 8–0 which is Germany's biggest World Cup victory. Only two teams have previously trailed by at least five goals at half-time: Zaire (versus Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (versus Poland in 1974). The seven goals scored by Germany reflected a better goal-scoring record in the World Cup Finals than that of 28 <b>other</b> <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> their respective history of the World Cup.|$|E
