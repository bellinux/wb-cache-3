Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

40|$|Employee {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> general corporate {{systems have}} thus far not received enough attention in the organizational justice literature. To fill this gap, we examined perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the compensation systems of international joint ventures in China. It is argued that perceptions <b>of</b> compensation system <b>fairness</b> are positively related to the three distributive justice dimensions, i. e., performance-based distributive justice, comparative distributive justice relative to foreign expatriates, and comparative distributive justice relative to local colleagues. Perceptions <b>of</b> compensation system <b>fairness</b> are also hypothesized to mediate {{the relationships between the}} three distributive justice dimensions and organizational commitment and turnover intention. A survey of 161 Chinese employees in Sino-foreign joint ventures found a positive relationship between perceptions of distributive justice and perceptions <b>of</b> compensation system <b>fairness.</b> In particular, compensation system fairness was more strongly associated with performance-based distributive justice than with the other two distributive justice dimensions based on social comparison. The mediating role <b>of</b> compensation system <b>fairness</b> was strongly supported. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

40|$|As firms seek ways {{to manage}} {{customer}} relationships {{over the long}} term, understanding {{the dynamics of the}} service provider–customer relationship becomes a key priority. In this article, the authors develop and test a dynamic model of customer usage of services, identifying causal links between customer’s prior usage levels, satisfaction evaluations, and subsequent service usage. The authors quantify the (heretofore anecdotal) relationship between customer satisfaction and subsequent service usage and provide new theoretical insights into the antecedents of customer satisfaction by introducing the concept of perceived payment equity. The primary contribution of the article is an understanding of how service usage changes over time, and particularly, how the consumer’s view <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> or “equity ” of the exchange over time affects the consumer’s usage of services. Specifically, payment equity represents the customer’s changing evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the level of economic benefits derived from usage in relation to the level of economic costs, that is, the customer’s evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the exchange. By examining the antecedents of payment equity, it can be determined how customers use price and usage over time to update their evaluations <b>of</b> the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the exchange. This evaluation affects overall satisfaction, which in turn affects future usage. The results suggest that customers’ usage levels can be managed through pricing strategies, communications, and more generally dynamic customer satisfaction management...|$|R
