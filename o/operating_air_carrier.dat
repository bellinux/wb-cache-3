50|$|Intrastate {{airlines}} in the U.S. {{are defined as}} <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>operating</b> inside of one individual state and thus not flying across state lines.

Between 1998 and 2000 EuroLOT also operated two 18-seat BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft. The primary task of EuroLOT was to reconstruct the network of domestic and regional flights while reducing operational costs and to create new value in the field of domestic air transport.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985 Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) {{initiated}} Bellingham's first passenger jet {{service with}} McDonnell Douglas MD-80s direct to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco with all PSA flights including {{a stop at}} Seattle/Tacoma. PSA was acquired by USAir which continued to serve Bellingham with Boeing 737-300s. Alaska Airlines introduced MD-80 jets in the late 1980s, competing with USAir with both airlines operating nonstop jet service to Seattle/Tacoma and direct one stop service to other destinations. USAir then {{changed its name to}} US Airways and eventually merged with American Airlines in 2015; however, by the early 1990s, USAir had ceased serving Bellingham.

About half of these flights operated by the competition were First Class only ($22.05); the rest carried coach passengers for $13.50 (all fares <b>operated</b> by interstate <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> were subject to 10% federal tax.)

5000|$|Upon {{becoming}} WestAir in 1979, the WestAir Group {{also bought}} Redding, California-based Golden Eagle Airlines, thereafter WestAir began to <b>operate</b> that former <b>air</b> <b>carrier's</b> Cessna 402 twin prop aircraft. WestAir used three different call signs over the years, first was [...] "Wescom". This lasted until {{the operation was}} briefly expanded to the eastern US, where Air Wisconsin used the call sign [...] "Wisconsin" [...] and was frequently confused with [...] "Wescom". This forced a call sign change to [...] "Shasta", but that only lasted {{a short period of}} time because it was frequently confused with [...] "Cessna". Finally, [...] "Sundance" [...] became the call sign until WestAir went out of business. The airline did however change the IATA code from VB to OE during the latter part of the 1980s. The SDU ICAO code was retained throughout their history. WestAir had hoped to acquire several regional jets, although no particular model had been specifically selected until 1987, when it placed an order for several British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jets to be delivered starting in 1988. WestAir became part of the Mesa Air Group in May 1992. Shortly afterwards, WestAir's handful of British Aerospace BAe 146 jet aircraft were disposed of in an attempt to dig the airline out of an economic hole. However, United Airlines then canceled its United Express contract with the carrier, and in 1998 SkyWest Airlines replaced Westair as United's west coast regional United Express <b>air</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|R

5000|$|This high {{elevation}} {{airport in}} the Sierra Nevada Mountains just south of Lake Tahoe opened in 1959 with a 5900-ft runway. Starting in 1963 it had few airline flights: the first were Paradise Airlines Lockheed L-049 Constellations. Paradise ceased operations after a fatal accident in the mountains near Lake Tahoe and Pacific Air Lines arrived in 1964 with Fairchild F-27 turboprops. That summer, Lake Tahoe was on a [...] "milk run" [...] route flown with the F-27 by the airline: Pacific flight 771 operated a routing of Reno-Lake Tahoe-Sacramento-San Francisco-San Jose-Fresno-Bakersfield-Los Angeles-San Diego. In 1966 Pacific started operating the first jet service into Lake Tahoe with Boeing 727-100s flying a Los Angeles (LAX)-San Jose-Lake Tahoe round trip schedule. A 1966 Pacific Air Lines route map also depicted nonstop 727 service to San Francisco (SFO) and Reno from the airport. [...] This 727 service lasted less than a year, and Tahoe did not see scheduled jet flights again until 1983. Following cessation of the Pacific 727 service, a ban on scheduled passenger airline jet operations at the airport was initiated. Pacific Air Lines resumed Fairchild F-27 service and successors Air West and Hughes Airwest also operated Fairchild F-27 turboprop flights until the early 1970s. For a number of years, <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> initiating new flights had to use turboprop powered aircraft for their respective services into Lake Tahoe due to the jet ban with the Lockheed L-188 Electra propjet initially being flown by several airlines into the airport followed by other turboprop aircraft types <b>operated</b> by other <b>air</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R

N372AC sustained severe damage, including structural, engine, propeller (losing several blades), aerodynamic, and complete hydraulic failure (affecting flaps, landing gear, nose wheel steering, and primary brakes). The crew managed to make an emergency landing at Dodge County Airport in Juneau, WI (KUNU), but overran the runway due to the damage to the aircraft.
