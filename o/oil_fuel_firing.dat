40|$|The {{interest}} in large-scale solar heating has increased all around Europe from 140 MW in 2007 to 750 MW in end 2015. It {{can play an}} important role in the heating sector as it can increase the share of renewables and together with district heating system can increase the overall efficiency. The major advantage of solar heat is the non-limitation and availability all over. Sweden was one of the first countries to develop large-scale solar heat, but due to a very positive development for biomass fuel and changed rules for energy performance for building in Europe the development of large-scale solar heating decreased in Sweden. The positive development in biomass has led to a transition from fossil fuel used in heating plants to solid wood fuel which today creates opportunities to complement with solar heat. This since many heating plants often consists of a wood <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> boiler that runs all year around and an <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> boiler running during peak demand. During the summer month when the heat demand is low, the wood <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> boiler will be running on low power with low efficiency. Solar district heating systems connected to existing wood fired boilers with a central water tank as heat storage will make it possible to run the wood boiler on higher efficiency which will decrease emissions and operation costs. However, there is a major lack of awareness and knowledge about the potential with district heating and large-scale solar heat. This together with the low price for wood fuels has led to poor incentives to invest in solar system. The region Västra Götaland consists of 49 municipalities. The region is associated with the EC project SDHp 2 m about solar district heating that has a focus on technologies for large-scale solar district heating plants and their implementation into the district heating network. The aim of the study is to identify and select feasible heating plants within the region that have the opportunities of complementing solar heat to existing district heating systems. At least four existing boilers have been identified. The aim for further work is that at least one of these plants will move on to be used as a demonstration plant during 2017 - 2018 for other interested actors in the future. The thought is that through a demonstration plant, the gap between the actual status of existing technologies and knowledge about these technologies can hopefully be reduced and thereby increase the incentives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{consumption}} of <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> in Java shows {{that more than}} 70 % of <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> is consumed in metropolitan cities, 14. 2 % is consumed in big cities, and 15. 67 % is consumed in medium cities. The variables of urban transport system powerfully influencing on <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption are motor vehicles and roads. The influence of city typology (the number of population and) on <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption {{is greater than the}} influence of urban transport system on <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption, while the influence of population density on <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption is small. The greater the number of city population, the more <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> is consumed. This is contradictory to the theory believed so far (Newman, P. W.

This analysis and model of Partial Least Square (PLS) can be developed to measure and design <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption, by considering urban transport system, and {{can be used as a}} consideration in making decision on planning and designing urban transport system and <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption. and has an impact toward the environment.

Palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash was incorporated in concretes substituting 0, 5, 10, and 15 of normal portland cement by weight. The freshly mixed concretes were tested for filling ability, passing ability, and segregation resistance. The hardened concretes were tested for compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption, and permeable porosity. The effects of water/binder ratio and palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash content on the properties of concrete were observed. The correlations of compressive strength with ultrasonic pulse velocity and permeable porosity were also indentified. According to test results, the compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity decreased while the water absorption and permeable porosity increased with higher water/binder ratio.

This paper presents the effects of nano size palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash on the long term characteristics of mortar. The study covers basic properties of mortar including the morphology, porosity, compressive strength and microstructural with regards to the variations in the mix design of the mortar. The palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash used has gone through heat treatment and was ground to a nano size with the percentage replacement of cement used was 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. The different types of mortar samples were cast in a 70 x 70 x 70 mm cube for compressive strength test. All casting and testing of the samples were conducted in the laboratory at ambient temperature. The results show that the use of 80 % nano size palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash has produced higher compressive strength at the age of 28 days by 32 % compared to the control mortar. Grinding the palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash to a nano size particle has improved the reactivity of the ash and because of it is a {{waste material}} it reduces the cost of the mortar.

This lightweight concrete exhibits improvement in the compressive strength with the incorporation of 30 % palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash. However, the long term experimental result of the strength and durability performance of this modified concrete is unavailable. This paper reports the one year result on strength performance of aerated concrete containing palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash when subjected to different curing method and behavior of this material upon exposure to long term sulphate attack. Comparisons are made between behavior of plain aerated concrete mix as control specimen and another mix, aerated concrete with 30 % palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash as partial sand replacement. Compressive strength performance of the specimens were observed by placing it in two types of curing regime, water curing and air curing. Durability of the mixes were assessed by exposing the specimens in Sodium sulphate environment. Findings indicate that water curing promotes better pozzolanic reaction in aerated concrete containing palm <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> ash, that leads to formation of larger amount of C-S-H gel resulting it to be stronger than control specimen.
