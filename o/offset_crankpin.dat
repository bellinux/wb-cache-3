50|$|A 90° V-twin will, with {{a correct}} counterweight, yield perfect primary balance, {{although}} its firing intervals are uneven. A V-twin with an angle {{of less than}} 90° is more compact and has more even firing intervals, but has significantly poorer mechanical balance. <b>Offset</b> <b>crankpins</b> are sometimes used to reduce the resulting vibration.|$|R
50|$|Honda briefed their {{engineers}} {{to produce a}} compact, inline V twin engine with any angle narrower than 90 degrees, but leaving enough space between the cylinders to locate conventional carburetors with the airbox located under the fuel tank, to maintain a slim-profile without side-facing carburetors associated with some marques. The optimal design {{was found to be}} with the cylinder angle set at 52 degrees, but additionally having <b>offset</b> <b>crankpins</b> to achieve acceptable levels of vibration reduction without the need for additional balancing shafts which would have added weight and reduced power. The narrow-V engine was compact and at the time was one of the lightest and narrowest, enabling a frame design offering good manoeuvrability.|$|R
5000|$|In a V-twin engine the {{cylinders}} form a [...] "V" [...] around the crankshaft. A Vee-angle of 90°, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect {{primary and secondary}} balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42° (Indian), 45° (Harley-Davidson), 52° Honda, and 60° (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods (so that {{the cylinders}} are slightly offset), but a variation {{is to have a}} single crankpin with [...] "fork & blade" [...] con-rods, to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90° V-twins may have <b>offset</b> <b>crankpins</b> to try to reduce vibration.|$|R
50|$|In {{automobiles}} V8 {{engines are}} used {{in a wide variety}} of cars and trucks, mostly in more powerful segments and types of vehicles such as American muscle cars, sports cars, luxury cars, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles. Many car manufacturers offer a V8 as an option in vehicles which have a V6 or straight-6 as standard engine, often casting it as a symbol of exclusivity and prestige. In some cases, V6 engines are derived from V8 designs by removing two cylinders while maintaining the same V-angle so they can be built on the same assembly lines as the V8s and installed in the same engine compartments with few modifications. Some of these employ <b>offset</b> <b>crankpins</b> driving connecting rod pairs, enabling a regular firing sequence.|$|R
5000|$|A simple 90° V6 cannot {{achieve the}} same {{smoothness}} with only crankshaft counterweights, and if the 90° V6 uses shared crankpins like the V8, the engine will have uneven firing intervals, {{such as in the}} original [...] "odd-fire" [...] Buick V6 engine. This uneven firing interval results in roughness at idle and low RPM, and varying harmonics at higher engine speeds, making the [...] "odd-fire" [...] configuration unpopular with buyers, so most manufacturers now use split crankpins to make the firing intervals an even 120°. Therefore, designing a smooth V6 engine is a much more complicated problem than the straight-6, flat-6, and V8 layouts. Although the use of <b>offset</b> <b>crankpins,</b> counterweights, and flying arms has reduced the problem to a minor second-order vibration in modern designs, all V6s can benefit from the addition of auxiliary balance shafts to make them completely smooth.|$|R
50|$|The 72° Mercedes-Benz Bluetec Diesel V6 {{utilizes}} a counter-rotating {{balance shaft}} and <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> by 48° to eliminate vibration problems {{and make the}} engine even-firing.|$|R
50|$|More modern 90° V6 engines {{avoid this}} problem by using split crankpins, with {{adjacent}} <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> by 15° in opposite directions to achieve an even 120° ignition pattern. Such a 'split' crankpin is weaker than a straight one, but modern metallurgical techniques can produce a crankshaft that is adequately strong.|$|R
50|$|Inline twins with a 360° <b>crankpin</b> <b>offset</b> or flat-twins can {{be easily}} {{converted}} into twingles by firing both of the cylinders {{at the same time}} and installing a camshaft or camshafts that operate both cylinders' valves in parallel. Because many such engines already employ the wasted spark principle, only the camshaft modification is necessary. The Vintage Dirt Track Racing Association (VDTRA) 2010 Rules have banned vintage motorcycles from being set up as a twingle.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda NSR500 {{began and}} ended its {{life as a}} 'screamer', where the pistons were phased {{similarly}} to a four-stroke V-four with a 180° crank. However, in 1990 Honda set the crankpin phases of each pair of pistons within each bank {{to be the same}} (like a four-stroke 'droner': 360° crank), but with each bank's <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> by 180° to each other (effectively [...] "splitting" [...] the pins and changing the V-angle, in terms of ignition timing). This was called a 'big bang' engine.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} V angle for a V8 is 90°. This configuration features a wide, low engine with optimal firing and vibration characteristics. Many V6 and V10 engine configurations {{are derived from}} production V8 designs, so they often use the 90° angle; however, balance shafts are incorporated to reduce vibration and/or more complex cranks to even the firing cycle.V8s can use different angles. One notable example is the Ford/Yamaha V8 used in the Ford Taurus SHO. It was based on Ford's Duratec V6 and shares that engine's 60° V angle. A similar Yamaha-built engine was used by Volvo Cars between 2005 and 2010. These engines were designed for transverse front-wheel-drive installation and are narrower than usual for efficient use of space. Because they are not at the ideal 90° angle for a V8, they require a counter-rotating balance shaft and <b>offset</b> split <b>crankpins</b> for complete smoothness. 72° V8 engines {{have been used in}} modern racing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Pilcher, he {{switched}} to building the Wilson-Pilcher motor car, which was launched in 1900. This car was quite remarkable {{in that it was}} available with either flat-four or flat-six engines, which were very well balanced, and with a low centre of gravity making good stability. Each water cooled cylinder was separate and identical for either engine, having 3.75inch (95.25mm) bore and stroke, giving capacities of 2715cc for the four cylinder and 4072cc for the six cylinder. Cylinders were slightly <b>offset</b> with separate <b>crankpins,</b> and the crankshaft had intermediate bearings between each pair of cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{utilized}} a 90 degree V-angle to the crankshaft in {{preference to}} the taller but more common 60 degree design, with a compression ratio of 9.0:1. The crankshaft had <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> 30 degrees {{to provide a}} low profile engine that fires smoothly and evenly. The block and cross flow pent roof cylinder heads with 24 valves are die-cast from aluminum alloy and the cylinder bores are lined with cast iron. The exhaust system uses equal length exhaust pipes connected to the Exhaust manifold to minimize scavenging resistance and maximum total exhaust efficiency. An external high capacity water cooled oil cooler and filter maintain an efficient oil temperature.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary chaincase and the gearbox. Mounted {{on the end of}} the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{crankshaft}} {{contains two}} or more centrally-located coaxial cylindrical ("main") journals and one or more <b>offset</b> cylindrical <b>crankpin</b> ("rod") journals. The design of the Crankshaft considers the dynamic loading and the optimization an lead to a shaft diameter satisfying the requirements of Automobile’s specifications with cost and size effectiveness. Microsoft visual studio package {{was used in the}} development of this software, which is capable of designing the shaft with reference to its easy interface, being an open system and its ease of file formats acceptability. It was used during the entire cycle of this software development (analysis phase, design phase and implementation phase). The developed Software was able to design the crankshaft taken into consideration the dimensions and the materials used; it will automatically generate the shape after the input of the expected configuration. The Software was able to select the materials {{to be used in the}} Crankshaft design with its properties and loading conditions incorporated. Consequently, the problems encountered in manually shaft design which is majorly design error, repetitive drawing and, or iteration when changes are to be made, can be overcome if the various advantages, utilities and flexibilities which modern high – speed micro – computers offer are put into good use in the design of shafts...|$|R
50|$|More modern 90° V6 engine designs {{avoid these}} {{vibration}} problems by using more sophisticated crankshafts with split <b>crankpins</b> <b>offset</b> by 30° between piston pairs {{to make the}} firing intervals an even 120°. They often add balancing shafts to eliminate the other vibration problems inherent in the layout. Examples include the later versions of the Buick V6, Chevrolet Vortec 4300, and earlier versions of the Mercedes-Benz V6. The 90° Mercedes V6, although {{it was designed to}} be built on the same assembly lines as the V8, used split crankpins, a counter-rotating balancing shaft, and careful acoustic design to make it almost as smooth as the inline-6 it replaced. However, in later versions Mercedes changed the cylinder banks to a 60° angle to make the engine more compact and eliminate the balancing shaft. Despite the difference in V angles, Mercedes modified its production lines so it could build 60° V6s on the same assembly lines as 90° V8s.|$|R
