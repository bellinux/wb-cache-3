40|$|A cloud manager {{deals with}} a dynamic multi {{objective}} opti- mization problem. Indeed, this problem {{lies in the fact}} that there is always a tradeoff between energy and performance in a virtualized data center. Therefore, a cloud manager must be equipped with a strategy to consolidate virtual ma- chines and configure them dynamically in a way that opti- mizes energy-performance tradeoff in an online manner. Dis- tributed dynamic VM consolidation strategy can be an effec- tive one to tackle this problem. The procedure of this strat- egy can be decomposed into four decision-making tasks. 1) Host overloading detection; 2) VM selection; 3) Host un- derloading detection; and 4) VM placement. The dynamic optimization is achieved when each of aforementioned de- cisions are made optimally in an online manner. In this paper with concentration on host <b>overloading</b> <b>detection</b> and VM selection task, we propose the Fuzzy Q-Learning (FQL) as an intelligent and online machine learning approach in order to make optimal decisions towards dynamic energy- performance tradeoff optimization...|$|R

We used # 1, # 2, and # 3 to represent iqrmc 1.5, lrrmmt 1.2 and lrrmc 1.2 respectively. For example PABFD# 1 means we used PABFD as our VM placement algorithm and iqrmc 1.5 as our VM selection and <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> policy, i.e., iqr as <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> with threshold 1.5, mc as maximum correlation VM selection policy.|$|E
30|$|The first sub-problem is host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> and {{involves}} deciding when a specific host PM {{is considered to}} be overloaded. Host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> requires migrating one or more VMs from the overloaded host to a non-overloaded one. They developed three main solutions for solving the host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> problem. These solutions are using a static CPU utilization threshold, an adaptive threshold using median absolute deviation (MAD) and interquartile range (IQR), and local regression-based using local regression (LR) and robust local regression (LRR). They found that the LRR algorithm was the best for solving the host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> problem. The second sub-problem was host under-load detection, which involves identifying when to decide that a host PM is under-loaded. They migrate all VMs from an under-loaded host to other hosts, if possible, and then switch that machine into power saving mode. The third sub-problem was VM selection and it involves identifying which VMs should be selected from an overloaded host for migration. They proposed 3 VM selection policies, namely minimum migration time (MMT), random selection (RS) and maximum correlation (MC). They found that MMT was the best for VM selection. The final sub-problem was the VM placement problem, and it involves identifying which hosts should be used for placing the migrated VMs. They deployed a power aware best fit decreasing (PABFD) algorithm, which is {{a modified version of the}} best fit decreasing (BFD) that considers CPU utilization during the allocation.|$|E

Besides, we have introduced a new <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm based on mean, median and standard deviation of utilization of VMs. In this research, we study the performance of our proposed VM selection algorithm coupled with the newly designed <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic {{consolidation}} of virtual machines (VMs) {{is an effective}} way to improve the utilization of resources and energy efficiency in cloud data centers. Determining when it is best to reallocate VMs from an overloaded host is an aspect of dynamic VM consolidation that directly influences the resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. The influence on the QoS is {{explained by the fact that}} server overloads cause resource shortages and performance degradation of applications. Current solutions to the problem of host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> are generally heuristic based, or rely on statistical analysis of historical data. The limitations of these approaches are that they lead to suboptimal results and do not allow explicit specification of a QoS goal. We propose a novel approach that for any known stationary workload and a given state configuration optimally solves the problem of host <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> by maximizing the mean intermigration time under the specified QoS goal based on a Markov chain model. We heuristically adapt the algorithm to handle unknown nonstationary workloads using the Multisize Sliding Window workload estimation technique. Through simulations with workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs, we show that our approach outperforms the best benchmark algorithm and provides approximately 88 percent of the performance of the optimal offline algorithm.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{data centers}} are growing rapidly in both number and capacity {{to meet the}} increasing demands for highly-responsive computing and massive storage. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. The reason for this extremely high energy consumption {{is not just the}} quantity of computing resources and the power inefficiency of hardware, but rather lies in the inefficient usage of these resources. VM consolidation involves live migration of VMs hence the capability of transferring a VM between physical servers with a close to zero down time. It is an effective way to improve the utilization of resources and increase energy efficiency in cloud data centers. VM consolidation consists of host overload/underload detection, VM selection and VM placement. Most of the current VM consolidation approaches apply either heuristic-based techniques, such as static utilization thresholds, decision-making based on statistical analysis of historical data; or simply periodic adaptation of the VM allocation. Most of those algorithms rely on CPU utilization only for host <b>overload</b> <b>detection.</b> In this paper we propose using hybrid factors to enhance VM consolidation. Specifically we developed a multiple regression algorithm that uses CPU utilization, memory utilization and bandwidth utilization for host <b>overload</b> <b>detection.</b> The proposed algorithm, Multiple Regression Host <b>Overload</b> <b>Detection</b> (MRHOD), significantly reduces energy consumption while ensuring a high level of adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLA) since it gives a real indication of host utilization based on three parameters (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth) utilizations instead of one parameter only (CPU utilization). Through simulations we show that our approach reduces power consumption by 6 times compared to single factor algorithms using random workload. Also using PlanetLab workload traces we show that MRHOD improves the ESV metric by about 24 % better than other single factor regression algorithms (LR and LRR).

In {{the face of}} increasing evidence of plagiarism in higher education the maintenance of educational integrity relies on the capacity of universities to strengthen their systems for consistent detection of and penalties for deliberate plagiarism, cheating and other fraudulent practices. However, {{there is a danger}} that the resolve to do so may be weakened if these systems become <b>overloaded</b> by the <b>detection</b> of a high incidence of unintentional plagiarism. The focus of this paper is on international students for whom English is an additional language (EAL) and whose plagiarism is most easily recognised, as many set out on their degree courses with no experience in a Western academic environment, an unsteady command of English grammar and a relatively limited range of vocabulary. The advice to 'use their own words' in order to avoid accidental plagiarism may be more confusing than helpful for them. This paper proposes that far from trapping students in their existing repertoire of words, the teaching, assessment and feedback advice provided within university courses should explicitly support their students' development of the formal language that is valued in academic writing. It is suggested that the basis for doing so is an understanding of the essential differences between informal, spoken language and the more formal style required in written assignments.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is a new}} computing paradigm that oﬀers scalable {{storage and}} compute resources to users on demand through Internet. Public cloud providers operate large-scale data centers {{around the world to}} handle a large number of users request. However, data centers consume an immense amount of electrical energy that can lead to high operating costs and carbon emissions. One of the most common and eﬀective method in order to reduce energy consumption is Dynamic Virtual Machines Consolidation (DVMC) enabled by the virtualization technology. DVMC dynamically consolidates Virtual Machines (VMs) into the minimum number of active servers and then switches the idle servers into a power-saving mode to save energy. However, maintaining the desired level of Quality-of-Service (QoS) between data centers and their users is critical for satisfying users’ expectations concerning performance. Therefore, the main challenge is to minimize the data center energy consumption while maintaining the required QoS. This thesis address this challenge by presenting novel DVMC approaches to reduce the energy consumption of data centers and improve resource utilization under workload independent quality of service constraints. These approaches can be divided into three main categories: heuristic, meta-heuristic and machine learning. Our ﬁrst contribution is a heuristic algorithm for solving the DVMC problem. The algorithm uses a linear regression-based prediction model to detect over-loaded servers based on the historical utilization data. Then it migrates some VMs from the over-loaded servers to avoid further performance degradations. Moreover, our algorithm consolidates VMs on fewer number of server for energy saving. The second and third contributions are two novel DVMC algorithms based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. RL is interesting for highly adaptive and autonomous management in dynamic environments. For this reason, we use RL to solve two main sub-problems in VM consolidation. The ﬁrst sub-problem is the server power mode detection (sleep or active). The second sub-problem is to ﬁnd an eﬀective solution for server status <b>detection</b> (<b>overloaded</b> or non-overloaded). The fourth contribution of this thesis is an online optimization meta-heuristic algorithm called Ant Colony System-based Placement Optimization (ACS-PO). ACS is a suitable approach for VM consolidation due to the ease of parallelization, that it is close to the optimal solution, and its polynomial worst-case time complexity. The simulation results show that ACS-PO provides substantial improvement over other heuristic algorithms in reducing energy consumption, the number of VM migrations, and performance degradations. Our ﬁfth contribution is a Hierarchical VM management (HiVM) architecture based on a three-tier data center topology which is very common use in data centers. HiVM has the ability to scale across many thousands of servers with energy eﬃciency. Our sixth contribution is a Utilization Prediction-aware Best Fit Decreasing (UP-BFD) algorithm. UP-BFD can avoid SLA violations and needless migrations by taking into consideration the current and predicted future resource requirements for allocation, consolidation, and placement of VMs. Finally, the seventh and the last contribution is a novel Self-Adaptive Resource Management System (SARMS) in data centers. To achieve scalability, SARMS uses a hierarchical architecture that is partially inspired from HiVM. Moreover, SARMS provides self-adaptive ability for resource management by dynamically adjusting the utilization thresholds for each server in data centers...|$|R

30|$|To {{decide whether}} a host is {{overloaded}} or not, {{there are several}} algorithms proposed [1, 2, 4] (e.g., Inter Quartile Range (IQR): which decides the threshold of a host to be marked as overloaded using interquartile range, Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) uses median absolute deviation and THR provides threshold for a host to be marked as overloaded. Local Regression (LR) and Local Robust Regression (LRR) provide prediction of host utilization,). These statistical measures provide a threshold (IQR, MAD and THR) and prediction (LR and LRR) for a host {{to be identified as}} overloaded. In parallel, these algorithms rely on mean and standard deviation of resource utilization that gives an indication of future load of a VM which also can be an approach independently for <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> [15]. However, mean and standard deviation is very much influenced by terminal values. Terminal values indicate the outlier values or the values that are too large or too small and do not represent the normal values. As VM’s resource utilization can be very dynamic in real world, instead of mean we can use median and we can modify the formula for standard deviation using median instead of mean. An <b>overload</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm can be designed from this.|$|E
