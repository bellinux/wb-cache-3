5|$|The {{argument}} that a person's income is not taxed {{when the person}} rejects or renounces United States citizenship because the person {{claims to be a}} citizen exclusively of a state, and variations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument,</b> have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{indications}} that the other detainees being held at facilities throughout the world (e.g., Bagram Air Base and black sites), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the Geneva Conventions afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about the strength <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument,</b> some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument,</b> {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2006, Anthelion commenced creating their first album Bloodshed Rebefallen. This time the members {{decided to go to}} Europe and record at Studio Fredman [...] in Sweden. Due to the album being an independent, self-financed production, funding and scheduling issues with the studio postponed the album recording process several times. This was a very difficult time for Anthelion; they tried to collect and raise money using a variety of methods, including taking out a mortgage to increase funds. On top <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>arguments</b> surrounding the composition of the new album’s material emerged and didn't cease.|$|R

50|$|Since G is finitely presentable and {{therefore}} accessible, the process <b>of</b> iterating <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> eventually terminates with finite groups, and produces a decomposition of G as the fundamental group of a finite graph-of-groups with finite vertex and edge groups.

25|$|The {{argument}} {{hinges on}} the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> is given by Sir Roger Penrose.|$|E

25|$|The result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> is that finite and infinite—and, by extension, {{particular}} and universal, nature and freedom—don't face {{one another as}} two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former. Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and {{particular and}} universal, and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.|$|E
25|$|Relativity of {{simultaneity}} maybe imply eternalism (and hence a B-theory of time), {{where the}} present for different observers {{is a time}} slice of the four dimensional universe. However this suggestion can be countered in the A-Theorist perspective by simply suggesting the perceived lack of simultaneity is simply an illusion caused by varying perspective occurring at different observers.This is demonstrated in the Rietdijk–Putnam argument and additionally in an advanced form <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>argument</b> called the Andromeda paradox, created by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose.|$|E
5000|$|Here the {{judgmental}} {{words are}} [...] "our very own sons" [...] and [...] "mercenaries", which imply not only professional soldiers but rather soldiers <b>of</b> fortune. <b>This</b> <b>argument</b> {{is also a}} false dilemma: nothing implies that coercion and fear of punishment produces better soldiers than voluntarity, and that a professional army could not be assembled from the nation's own citizens.|$|R
