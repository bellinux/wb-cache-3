5|$|Other {{creative}} {{artists have}} celebrated Britten. In 1970 Walton composed Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> from Britten's Piano Concerto. Works commemorating Britten include Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten an orchestral piece written in 1977 by Arvo Pärt, and Sally Beamish's Variations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> of Benjamin Britten, {{based on the}} second Sea Interlude from Peter Grimes; she composed the work to mark Britten's centenary. Alan Bennett depicts Britten in a 2009 play The Habit of Art, set while Britten is composing Death in Venice and centred on a fictional meeting between Britten and Auden. Britten was played in the premiere production by Alex Jennings.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read passages from the Bible during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Before its release, many journalists {{expected}} Pirates of the Caribbean to be a flop. The pirate genre had {{not been}} successful for years, with Cutthroat Island (1995) being a notable flop. The film was also based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> park ride, and Depp, known mostly for starring in cult films at the time, had little track record as a box office leading man.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E

5|$|During 1937 Britten {{composed}} a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, {{he had become}} an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.|$|E
25|$|Edward Elgar {{composed}} his Variations <b>on</b> <b>an</b> Original <b>Theme,</b> Op. 36, {{popularly known}} as the Enigma Variations, between October 1898 and February 1899. It is an orchestral work comprising fourteen variations <b>on</b> <b>an</b> original <b>theme.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1958 Sargent {{recorded}} Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, {{one of his}} specialities, {{which was}} reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004. Sargent recorded Walton's Façade Suites in 1961. With the LSO, Sargent recorded Walton's Orb and Sceptre March. He also made a stereo recording of Walton's First Symphony {{in the presence of}} the composer, but Walton privately preferred André Previn's recording, issued in January 1967, the same month as Sargent's. Of Vaughan Williams's shorter pieces, Sargent recorded, with the BBC in 1960, the Fantasia <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> by Thomas Tallis (which he also recorded with the Philharmonia), and with the LSO, Serenade to Music (1957; choral version) and Toward the Unknown Region. He also recorded Vaughan Williams's overture The Wasps with the LSO.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{the fiftieth}} anniversary of Kappa Kappa Psi, {{there were enough}} {{performers}} to create two bands. The National Intercollegiate Symphonic Band, the top ensemble, was conducted by Norman Dello Joio and premiered his new work, Songs of Abelard. The Symphonic Band also performed several other Dello Joio works, including Scenes from the Louvre, Variants on a Mediaeval Tune, and Fantasies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> by Haydn.

5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British critics to the exhibition, and their focus <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> of nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E
5|$|The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) {{is a form}} {{of poetry}} common in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain {{at the end of the}} second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an {{identical}} meter. The ghazal often reflects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> of unattainable love or divinity.|$|E
5|$|When Harding {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1920 he was considered a long shot until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General Leonard Wood, could not gain the needed majority, and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a front porch campaign, remaining {{for the most part}} in Marion and allowing the people to come to him. He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs, running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme,</b> she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Walton's orchestral {{works of}} the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Theme</b> by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were {{composed}} for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin. A concert suite of Walton's score was published and recorded after Walton's death. After his experience over Battle of Britain, Walton declared that he would write no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of Chekhov's Three Sisters in 1969.|$|E
