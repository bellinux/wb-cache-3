40|$|In the {{coordinate}} systems defined in Fig. 2, XOY is an inertialthe vehicle must carry heavy loads. Platform designs {{have been proposed}} to achieve near omni-directional mobility using conventional wheels. Such designs are inherently simpler than special wheel designs. They can have high load capacity and high tolerance to floor irregularities such as bumps, cracks, dirt, and debris. The most common approach is to use actively steered wheels @ 6 #. Vehicles based on this design {{have at least two}} active wheels, each of which has both driving and steering actuators that allow the wheels to move in any direction from any configuration, but not instantaneously. However, these vehicles are not truly omni-directional because they need to stop and re-orient their wheels when following a trajectory without C 1 continuity. A truly omni-directional vehicle can be formed using coordinate frame and XwCY w is a moving coordinate frame at-tached to the wheel module at the <b>offset</b> <b>link</b> joint ~point C).

40|$|Rapid climatic {{switches}} during marine isotope stage 3 (29 - 59 ka BP) {{are often}} attributed to ocean circulation changes caused by freshwater {{input into the}} North Atlantic through the melting of large amounts of icebergs and sea ice. However, recent studies have questioned this direct coupling between factors influencing the ocean-climate system. By combining multiple proxies from two mid depth northern North Atlantic sediment cores we assess temporal <b>offsets</b> and <b>links</b> between freshwater input and response of the near bottom flow {{as well as between}} near bottom flow and sea surface temperatures changes. Grain size, mineralogical and magnetic proxies for ice rafting and near-bottom flow speed, interpreted as indicators of freshwater input and deep circulation strength, consistently indicate a delay in the recovery of the deep circulation after freshwater perturbations. Sea surface temperature variability is inferred from foraminiferal assemblages and Mg/Ca and delta O- 18 of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma s. The records show rapid switches towards higher temperatures following the ice-rafting events. Interestingly, near sea surface temperatures increased and decreased again during periods of accelerating bottom flow speed, likely reflecting the sudden release of heat from deeper in the water column, rather than circulation changes. Our data thus confirm the impact of freshwater forcing on the Atlantic deep circulation, but suggest that temperature variability at the surface was not directly linked to these circulation changes...|$|R

Green times of each signal and common cycle length are given and only relative offsets are variables. Total delay {{is made up of}} delay at each link on main street. Findings are as follows : If only one direction is congested, preferential offset for uncongested direction is optimal. If both directions are congested, it is optimal to give preferential <b>offset</b> to each <b>link</b> of either direction. If traffic demands from cross streets through turning movements enter the main street and make it congested, it is difficult to optimize the offset from a viewpoin of total delay on main street.

40|$|Authorities {{operating}} {{in the field of}} coastal management require reliable area-wide height information for their responsibilities regarding to the safety of the coastal area. In this context the lidar technique replaces more and more traditional methods, such as terrestrial surveying, and is now the most important source for the generation of digital terrain models (DTM) in this zone. However, coastal vegetation interferes with the laser beam, resulting in a height offset for the lidar points depending on different vegetation types occurring in this region and their phenology. Various filter algorithms were developed for lidar data in vegetated areas, which are able to minimize this offset. But in very dense vegetation and hilly terrain these algorithms often fail resulting in certain residuals. In a previous approach the height offset was estimated based on grid data. In this algorithm the <b>offset</b> was <b>linked</b> to suitable features in the remote sensing data. A segment based supervised classification was performed using these features to partition the lidar data into different accuracy intervals. A major problem of this method arises {{from the fact that the}} accuracy intervals do not correspond to distinct and easily separable clusters in the feature space. Considering a single vegetation type the height offset exhibits a rather continuous characteristic. In a new approach this issue is tackled by modelling the offset with respect to the features using continuous functions. Additionally, feature extraction and classification are performed on raw data, in order to maintain the significance of the features by avoiding transformation artefacts and to increase the accuracy of the classification. On the basis of test data a comparison between the two methods is conducted to emphasize the problems and their solutions. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparative}} analysis of atmospheric parameters obtained {{with the so-called}} photometric and spectroscopic techniques. Photometric and spectroscopic data for 1360 DA white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are used, as well as spectroscopic data from the Villanova White Dwarf Catalog. We first test the calibration of the ugriz photometric system by using model atmosphere fits to observed data. Our photometric analysis indicates that the ugriz photometry appears well calibrated when the SDSS to AB_ 95 zeropoint corrections are applied. The spectroscopic analysis of the same data set reveals that the so-called high-log g problem can be solved by applying published correction functions that take into account 3 D hydrodynamical effects. However, a comparison between the SDSS and the White Dwarf Catalog spectra also suggests that the SDSS spectra still suffer from a small calibration problem.

Based on a hand-collected dataset of 958 firm-year observations of Chinese listed firms for the 2006 - 2012 period, we find that firms paying higher executive cash compensation are associated with lower tax aggressiveness. This relationship also holds for the excess cash compensation measures which control for executive shareholding, firm profitability, size, growth opportunity, and board independence. We further document that mutual funds ownership pressure firms paying higher compensation to reduce their tax aggressiveness, suggesting adverse selection by mutual funds on firms exhibiting risky tax avoidance activities. High leverage <b>offsets</b> the negative <b>link</b> between cash compensation and tax aggressiveness, indicating a complementary effect between debt and tax avoidance, and, hence, suggesting that creditor monitoring is weak.
