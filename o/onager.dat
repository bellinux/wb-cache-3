5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the <b>onager,</b> Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the <b>Onager</b> as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{was also}} an {{important}} economic activity for the pre-Akkadian kingdom of Nagar, which had Ebla and Kish as major partners. The kingdom produced glass, wool, and was famous for breeding and trading in the Kunga, a hybrid of a donkey and a female <b>onager.</b> Tell Brak remained an important commercial center during the Akkadian period, {{and was one of}} Mitanni's main trade cities. Many objects were manufactured in Mitannian Tell Brak, including furniture made of ivory, wood and bronze, in addition to glass. The city provided evidence for the international commercial contacts of Mitanni, including Egyptian, Hittite and Mycenaean objects, some of which were produced in the region to satisfy the local taste.|$|E
50|$|<b>Onagers</b> {{are larger}} than donkeys at about 200 kg to 290 kg in size and 2.1 m to 2.5 m in head-body length. Male <b>onagers</b> are usually larger than females.|$|R
50|$|The Turkmenian kulan {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>onagers.</b> It is 200-250 cm long, 100-140 cm tall at the shoulder, and it weighs 200-240 kg. Male <b>onagers</b> are larger than the females.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, Persian <b>onagers</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} in Saudi Arabia, where the Syrian wild ass once lived. Introduced Persian <b>onagers</b> live in deserts foraging on grasses and branches or woodier plant material in dry seasons.|$|R
25|$|There {{are five}} {{subspecies}} of Asiatic wild ass or <b>onager,</b> Equus hemionus, and three subspecies of the kiang, Equus kiang, of the Himalayan upland.|$|E
25|$|A {{catapult}} is a siege engine {{which used}} an arm to hurl a projectile. The Roman version was called an <b>onager.</b> Projectiles included both arrows and (later) stones.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the late}} Roman writer Vegetius' De Re Militari, each century had a ballista and each cohort had an <b>onager,</b> giving the legion a {{formidable}} siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers, each manned by 10 libritors (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these {{would be used to}} help defend Roman forts and fortified camps (castra) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as field artillery during battles or in support of river crossings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Onagers</b> {{used to be}} {{numerous}} {{from the}} Middle East to China. However, until the 19th century, their population has been reduced from several thousand to a few thousand. Currently, more than 600 Persian <b>onagers</b> {{are living in the}} wild.|$|R
50|$|<b>Onagers</b> are {{the most}} horse-like of wild asses. <b>Onagers</b> are short-legged {{compared}} to horses, and their coloring varies depending on the season. They are generally reddish-brown in color during the summer, becoming yellowish-brown or grayish-brown in the winter. They have a black stripe bordered in white that extends {{down the middle of}} the back. The belly, the buttocks and the muzzle are white in most <b>onagers,</b> except for the Mongolian wild ass that has a broad black dorsal stripe bordered with white.|$|R
50|$|The species's {{population}} {{had recently been}} in decline in the country while it slowly increases in reintroduction sites. The Turkmenian kulan has been reintroduced to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine, where the <b>onagers</b> formerly existed, also in Israel, where the subspecies are making hybrids with Persian <b>onagers</b> in the wild.|$|R
25|$|The {{traction}} trebuchet was a siege engine {{which uses}} {{the power of}} men pulling on ropes or the energy stored in a raised weight to rotate what was, again, a staff sling. It was designed so that, when the throwing arm of the trebuchet had swung forward sufficiently, {{one end of the}} sling would automatically become detached and release the projectile. Some trebuchets were small and operated by a very small crew; however, unlike the <b>onager,</b> it was possible to build the trebuchet on a gigantic scale: such giants could hurl enormous rocks at huge ranges. Trebuchets are, in essence, mechanised slings.|$|E
25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the {{mountain}} zebra show a distinct dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most {{have a black}} dorsal stripe, though {{it can be difficult}} to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the <b>onager</b> and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} includes, firs, oaks, conifers, platanus, willow, olive trees, poplar, hawthorn, oriental plane, cherry plum, rose hips, {{pistachio}} trees, rosaceae, pear, mountain ash poplar. The desert in the south is mostly steppe and would feature xeric plants such as palm trees, tamarix, date palm, fraxinus, poa, white wormwood and chenopodiaceae. Animals found {{in the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, <b>onager,</b> mangar and the Euphrates softshell turtle. Bird species include, the see-see partridge, Menetries's warbler, western jackdaw, hooded crow, European nightjar, rufous-tailed scrub robin, masked shrike and the pale rockfinch.|$|E
50|$|Other than deserts, {{it lives}} in grasslands, plains, steppes, and savannahs. Like many other large grazing animals, the <b>onager's</b> range has {{contracted}} greatly under {{the pressures of}} poaching and habitat loss. Previously listed as Endangered, <b>onagers</b> have been classified as Near Threatened by IUCN in 2015. Of the five subspecies, one is extinct, two are endangered, and two are near threatened (their status in China is not well known). Persian <b>onagers</b> are currently being reintroduced in the Middle East as replacement for the extinct Syrian wild ass in the Arabian Peninsula, Israel and Jordan.|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{the biggest}} {{predator}} for <b>onagers</b> are gray wolves. Investigations {{revealed that a}} 23% of prey proportion of gray wolves were attributed to the Asian wild ass. However, like most equids, they {{are known to have}} anti-predator protection. Groups of stallions cooperate and try to chase off predators. If threatened, <b>onagers</b> defend themselves and violently kick at the incoming predator.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{depiction of}} {{vehicles in the}} context of warfare is on the Standard of Ur in southern Mesopotamia, c. 2500 BCE. These are more properly called wagons or carts and were double-axled and pulled by oxen or a hybrid of a donkey and a female <b>onager,</b> named Kunga in the city of Nagar which was famous for breeding them. The hybrids were used by the Eblaite, early Sumerian, Akkadian and Ur III armies. Although sometimes carrying a spearman with the charioteer (driver), such heavy wagons, borne on solid wooden wheels and covered with skins, may {{have been part of the}} baggage train (e.g., during royal funeral processions) rather than vehicles of battle in themselves.|$|E
25|$|Molecular phylogenies {{indicate}} {{the most recent}} common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) {{within the range of}} 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the kulan, <b>onager,</b> and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Bahram V {{has many}} well known stories of valor, beauty, {{victories}} over the Romans, Turkic peoples, Indians and Africans, hunting and love; he is called Bahram-e Gur, Gur meaning <b>onager,</b> {{on account of}} his love for hunting and, in particular, hunting onagers. He symbolized a king at the height of a golden age, embodying royal prosperity. He had won his crown by competing with his brother and spent time fighting foreign enemies, but mostly kept himself amused by hunting, court parties and a famous band of ladies and courtiers. During his time, the best pieces of Sassanid literature were written, notable pieces of Sassanid music were composed, and sports such as polo became royal pastimes, a tradition that continues to this day in many kingdoms.|$|E
50|$|During the winter, <b>onagers</b> also eat snow as a {{substitute}} for water. When natural water sources are unavailable, the Asiatic wild ass digs holes in dry riverbeds to access subsurface water. The water holes dug by the wild asses are often subsequently visited by domestic livestock, as well as other wild animals. Water is also found in the plants on which the <b>onagers</b> feed.|$|R

25|$|The Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs {{from the}} 1st {{millennium}} BCE depict lion and bull hunts in fertile landscapes. Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on {{an abundance of}} animals living in the area, {{many of which have}} become rare or even extinct. Species like gazelle, <b>onager</b> and the now-extinct Arabian ostrich lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley, while the valley itself was home to the wild boar. Carnivorous species include the gray wolf, the golden jackal, the red fox, the leopard and the lion. The Syrian brown bear {{can be found in the}} mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of European beaver has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of Abu Hureyra in Syria, but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.|$|E
2500|$|Horses {{may have}} been driven even earlier. [...] The Standard of Ur, in ancient Sumer, c. 2500 BC, shows horses or some type of <b>onager</b> or donkey hitched to wheeled carts with a yoke around their necks, {{in a manner similar}} to that of oxen.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{earliest}} form, Greek fire was hurled onto enemy forces by firing a burning cloth-wrapped ball, perhaps containing a flask, using {{a form of}} light catapult, most probably a seaborne variant of the Roman light catapult or <b>onager.</b> [...] These were capable of hurling light loads—around —a distance of [...]|$|E
50|$|In 1968, 11 Persian and Turkmenian <b>onagers</b> {{were flown}} from their {{countries}} to Israel {{in exchange for}} Israeli gazelles. These were bred in captivity at the Hai Bar Yotvata wildlife sanctuary. Together, they bred a few Persian/Turkmenian hybrids in Israel. Offspring were introduced into the wild in the Negev Mountains area, intended to replace the local subspecies gone extinct. The introduced <b>onagers</b> have since established a stable population around 200 individuals.|$|R
25|$|The Sumerian {{military}} used carts harnessed to <b>onagers.</b> These early chariots functioned less {{effectively in}} combat than did later designs, {{and some have}} suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four <b>onagers.</b> The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.|$|R

2500|$|Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve, {{established}} in the 1960s to conserve [...] endangered species, including Biblical animals, from this and similar regions. The reserve has a Visitors Center, care and treatment enclosures, and large open area where desert animals are acclimated before re-introduction into the wild. Hai-Bar efforts have successfully re-introduced the Asian Wild Ass, or <b>Onager,</b> into the Negev. The Hai-Bar Nature Reserve and animal re-introduction program were described in Bill Clark's book [...] "High Hills and Wild Goats: Life Among the Animals of the Hai-Bar Wildlife Refuge". The book also describes life in Eilat and the surrounding area.|$|E
2500|$|Most [...] "wild" [...] horses today, {{such as the}} American mustang or the Australian brumby, are {{actually}} feral horses descended from domesticated animals that escaped and adapted {{to life in the}} wild. In contrast, the Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated and remains the only true wild horse in the world today. Przewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of Equus ferus, the others being the domesticated horse Equus ferus caballus, and the extinct tarpan Equus ferus ferus. There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the African wild ass, <b>onager</b> (including the Mongolian wild ass), and kiang.|$|E
50|$|The Syrian {{wild ass}} (Equus hemionus hemippus), less {{commonly}} known as an achdari or hemippe, or Mesopotamian <b>onager</b> or Syrian <b>onager</b> is an extinct subspecies of <b>onager</b> native to the Arabian peninsula. It ranged across present-day Syria, the Palestinian territories, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>onagers,</b> the Turkmenian kulan is {{threatened}} by poaching, hunting for their meat and their coat, habitat loss and relationships with apex predators such as the Persian leopards, striped hyenas and mostly Asian gray wolves. The now-extinct Central Asian predators, the Caspian tigers and Asiatic cheetahs also preyed on the kulans. However, like other <b>onagers,</b> they have anti-predatory protections. Group of stallions can cooperate and chase off the predators. The Asiatic wild ass of Central Asia is mostly threatened by illegal hunting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Onagers</b> are {{notoriously}} untamable. Equids {{were used in}} ancient Sumer to pull wagons circa 2600 BC, and then chariots on the Standard of Ur, circa 2550 BC. Clutton-Brock (1992) suggests that these were donkeys rather than <b>onagers</b> {{on the basis of}} a [...] "shoulder stripe". However, close examination of the animals (equids, sheep and cattle) on both sides of the piece indicate that what appears to be a stripe may well be a harness, a trapping, or a joint in the inlay.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the species}} kept here are, American bison, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, white-naped crane, maned wolves, cheetahs, a mariana crow, black-footed ferrets, persian <b>onagers,</b> Hartmann's {{mountain}} zebras and scimitar-horned oryxs.|$|R
