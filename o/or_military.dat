5|$|Although not {{required}} by law <b>or</b> <b>military</b> regulation, members of the uniformed services are encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor {{as a matter of}} respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status, {{whether or not they are}} in uniform. This is one of the few instances where a living member of the military will receive salutes from members of a higher rank.|$|E
5|$|B-52s are {{periodically}} refurbished at USAF maintenance depots such as Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Even {{while the}} air force works on a new bomber, it intends to keep the B-52H in service until 2045, nearly 90 years after the B-52 first entered service, an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft, civilian <b>or</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} <b>or</b> <b>military</b> leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis means {{making the}} animal <b>or</b> <b>military</b> {{equipment}} {{hard to see}} (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent). Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways, such as by living underground or by being active only at night, {{as well as by}} a variety of methods of camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier <b>or</b> <b>military</b> vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E

LARPs can also be set in historical eras or have semi-historical settings with mythological or fantastical aspects incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Martello {{defended the}} growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s, criticizing what he {{deemed to be}} the continual {{repression}} of women within the Pagan movement. He also espoused the view that any Pagan {{who was involved in}} the U.S. government <b>or</b> <b>military</b> was a hypocrite. He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist.|$|E
5|$|She took {{a lively}} {{interest}} in affairs of state, {{and was a}} patroness of theatre, poetry and music. She subsidised George Frideric Handel with £200 a year.

She knighted Newton when she visited Cambridge in 1705.|$|E

Sixty-five percent (65%) of the families are <b>military</b> <b>or</b> are <b>military</b> related.|$|R

5|$|The Senate still {{controlled}} North Africa, {{an important}} regional producer of grain, {{as well as}} Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions. However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions {{under the control of}} Augustus, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political <b>or</b> <b>military</b> challenge to Octavian.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were {{overwhelmed by the}} tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; {{the last of the}} barricades (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional shots at police <b>or</b> <b>military</b> patrols—would continue for days afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} history, religion, and social movements. The {{historical}} narrative is guided more by social history than political <b>or</b> <b>military</b> history. Critics found {{the book to}} be rich in detail, realistic, and thoughtful. The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few years}} of {{unsteady}} peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, <b>or</b> <b>military</b> aid sent to the Scots.|$|E
5|$|After usurping {{the throne}} of the Later Zhou dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) spent sixteen years conquering the rest of China, reuniting much of the {{territory}} that had once belonged to the Han and Tang empires and ending the upheaval of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In Kaifeng, he established a strong central government over the empire. He ensured administrative stability by promoting the civil service examination system of drafting state bureaucrats by skill and merit (instead of aristocratic <b>or</b> <b>military</b> position) and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire. In one such project, cartographers created detailed maps of each province and city that were then collected in a large atlas. Emperor Taizu also promoted groundbreaking scientific and technological innovations by supporting such works as the astronomical clock tower designed and built by the engineer Zhang Sixun.|$|E
