5|$|The Royal Family step <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of {{the palace}} and are applauded by the crowd, a title card {{explains}} that Logue was always present at King George VI's speeches {{during the war and}} that they remained friends {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
25|$|Following Ceaușescu's second {{failed attempt}} to address the crowd, he and Elena fled into a lift headed for the roof. A group of protesters managed to force {{their way into the}} building, {{overpower}} Ceaușescu's bodyguards and make their way through his office before heading <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> They didn't know it, but they were only a few metres from Ceaușescu. The lift's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceaușescu's bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1978 at 6:24p.m. {{local time}} (4:24p.m. UTC), {{the first signs}} of smokewhose color signifies {{the success or failure of}} an electionfrom the chimney of the Sistine Chapel appeared. However, it was unclear which color the smoke was for over an hour; some of the {{cardinals}} had personally deposited their notes and tally sheets in the stove, causing black smoke after white had already appeared. Pericle Felici, as the ranking Cardinal Deacon, then stepped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered the Habemus Papam announcement in Latin, declaring Luciani's election. John Paul I then appeared on the balcony; shortly after his withdrawal, the crowd's applause remained so loud that he was compelled to appear again.|$|E
50|$|Verandahs on timber posts with {{cast iron}} valance extend over <b>the</b> {{footpath}} with <b>balconies</b> above to both street frontages. <b>The</b> <b>balconies</b> have timber posts with cast iron balustrade and brackets. Pairs of frenchlights with fanlights above open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late September, {{the sewage}} pipes leaked, causing fecal matter to leak into room 309, and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> of most floors. As a result, 309 was unusable, and the carpet was {{stripped}} {{and the room}} unhabited {{for the rest of}} 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} was built with south facing “butterfly” wings {{that caught the}} sun {{for the benefit of}} the tuberculosis patients. Even during the winter months patients were wheeled out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> Fresh air, bed rest and good food were part of their treatment and a lot of the food for the patients was grown on the hospital farm.|$|R
25|$|RolePlay was {{the play}} written as the afterthought, but {{turned out to}} be the most {{successful}} play of the three. The play centres on a dinner party held by Justin Lazenby and Julie-Ann Jobson, where they intend to announce their engagement. Before the dinner begins, there are already signs of tension: Julie-Ann gets overly frantic about making the meal perfect for her parents (her father, it later turns out, is a right-wing bigot), and Justin's alcoholic mother is clearly going to arrive paralytic. However, the biggest complication turns out to be when Paige Petite climbs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> on the run from her violent boyfriend. Trapped in the flat by her minder, Justin and Julie-Ann are forced to keep up appearances during the dinner whilst the stand-off is played out.|$|E
25|$|Tina McIntyre {{embarked}} on an affair with Peter Barlow after they shared a passionate kiss during Peter and Carla Connor's wedding reception. Peter lies to Tina, telling {{her that he had}} leave Carla and move away with her to Portsmouth when he was actually committing to Carla after they discovered she was pregnant. The affair causes Peter to relapse and start drinking again. Carla's brother Rob Donovan discovers the affair and threatens them both that he will tell Carla if they do not. Tina books a taxi for her and Peter but cannot find Peter so she heads to the Rovers Return to find him and Carla celebrating Carla's pregnancy. Feeling crushed, Tina heads back to her flat and is pursued by Peter. They argue and Tina threatens Peter that she's going to reveal all about their affair to Carla, causing Peter to leave her flat and tell a heartbroken Carla about the affair before she does. Peter accidentally leaves Tina's flat door open whilst leaving and Rob notices and enters Tina's flat to confront her about her affair. Rob and Tina argue about her telling Carla about the affair, forcing them both onto her balcony outside. But when Tina threatens Rob about reporting his dodgy dealing at his pawn shop to the police, Rob pushes Tina from the balcony and she plummets to the ground. Rob frantically destroys Tina's flat in an attempt {{to make it look like}} a burglary and wipes his fingerprints off of everything he has touched. He heads outside to see a motionless Tina lying on the cobbles, he starts to call for an ambulance when Tina manages to get back to her feet. Rob tries backtracking his actions and tells Tina that she slipped but Tina goads Rob by saying she will report him for attempted murder as well as him selling illegal goods. Rob takes desperate measures to shut Tina up so he grabs a lead pipe from a van outside the builder's yard and bludgeons Tina to death. After Peter's confession, a furious Carla heads on the war path and goes in search of Tina. She notices Tina's door to her flat is open and heads inside to have it out with her. She enters the ransacked flat but does not find Tina anywhere, she heads out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and looks over to discover Tina's body on the floor below. Tina dies a week later from her injuries.|$|E
500|$|Six days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people {{gathered}} {{in front of}} the Casa Rosada, Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Perón's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Perón stepped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was very dramatic and recalled many important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Perón enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained [...] "mystic overtones" [...] of a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] nature.|$|E
50|$|This Victorian era hotel {{located near}} the {{intersection}} of George and Roma Streets features filigree cast iron lacework that has recently been reinstated <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> original cast iron verandah posts. It is of rendered brick construction with three storeys on the George Street facade and a fourth level basement. The basement walls are Brisbane Tuff stonework. The George Street facade has a post supported curved corrugated iron awning over <b>the</b> footpath, and <b>balconies</b> on <b>the</b> upper two levels. Eight pairs of French-lights open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> on each level. The first floor is emphasised by having a greater <b>balcony</b> height than <b>the</b> top floor. <b>The</b> topmost <b>balcony</b> has a curved corrugated iron roof hipped at the ends.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} range along Wickham Street {{is rendered}} to resemble ashlar. It has <b>balconies</b> to <b>the</b> two upper floors with cast iron twin posts, and balustrades and friezes of differing designs to each floor. <b>The</b> upper <b>balcony</b> has a curved galvanised iron roof below a corbelled and bracketed string course, a rendered parapet with two triangular pediments, and concrete balusters and urns. French doors with fanlights, between pilasters, open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> Changes to <b>the</b> street elevation have {{been confined to}} the ground floor shopfronts and {{the replacement of the}} original curved, post-supported awning with a flat cantilevered awning.|$|R
50|$|Barberina {{goes out}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> mansion's <b>balcony,</b> {{where she is}} seen by the King from <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of his own palace next door.

Then Tartagliona, following the advice of Brighella, fills Barberina with the desire for the ultimate in unattainable possessions: the legendary singing apple and dancing waters.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, Nazi {{aggression}} continued, and {{the government}} prepared for war. After the Munich Agreement of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was invited <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of Buckingham Palace with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler {{was the subject of}} some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as [...] "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century". However, historians argue that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in May 2002, Jackson {{allowed a}} {{documentary}} film crew, led by British TV personality Martin Bashir, {{to follow him}} around nearly everywhere he went. On November 20 of that year, Jackson brought his infant son Prince <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of his room at the Hotel Adlon in Berlin as fans stood below, holding him in his right arm with a cloth loosely draped over Prince's face. Prince was briefly extended over a railing, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it [...] "a terrible mistake". Bashir's crew was with Jackson during this incident; the program was broadcast in March 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson. In a particularly controversial scene, Jackson was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a young boy.|$|E
500|$|On 2 October, {{the king}} {{rejected}} the Declaration. Three days later, a Parisian crowd, led mostly by women fishmongers, marched to Versailles {{in response to}} the scarcity of bread. Members of the National Guard followed the march, with Lafayette reluctantly leading them. At Versailles, the king accepted the Assembly's votes on the Declaration, but refused requests to go to Paris. At dawn, the crowd broke into the palace. Lafayette took the royal family onto the palace balcony and attempted to restore order. The crowd insisted that the king and his family move to Paris and the Tuileries Palace. The king came <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> and the crowd started chanting [...] "Vive le Roi!" [...] When the unpopular queen, Marie Antoinette, appeared there with her children, she was told to send the children back in. [...] When she returned alone, people shouted to shoot her, but when she stood her ground, no one opened fire. Lafayette kissed her hand, leading to cheers from the crowd.|$|E
5000|$|The Queen Street facade has {{triangular}} Classical pediments at parapet level above {{each end}} window bay. These end bays {{are separated by}} flanking brick pilasters and have cantilevered balconies on both levels with wrought iron railings consisting of vertical balustrading. The openings contain timber framed multi-paned windows and french doors which open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> Ornate floral mouldings are situated on the pilasters {{to either side of}} the upper level openings. A deep bracketed cornice runs between the base of the pediments separating the parapet from the remainder of the facade. The parapet has raised sections at each end and in the centre where there is the name [...] "BRISBANE ARCADE" [...] in raised lettering.|$|R
50|$|The Ballroom, {{is similar}} in style to one at the Palace of Versailles, with gilt embellished columns and a highly {{decorated}} ceiling. The fine parquet sprung floor is made from oak, walnut and ebonised pearwood. French windows lead out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> famous <b>balcony</b> overlooking <b>the</b> Old Market Square.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the timber}} trusses {{have been left}} exposed on the upper level and the French doors with lead lights which opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> first floor <b>balcony</b> remain.|$|R
500|$|Crowds of {{citizens}} had gathered outside {{the steps and}} gates of ʻIolani Palace expecting the announcement of a new constitution. Among them were White and members of Hui Kālaiʻāina who had presented a sealed package containing the constitution. After the ministers' refusal to sign the new constitution, the queen stepped out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and asked the assembled people to return home, declaring [...] "their wishes for a new constitution could not be granted just then, but will be some future day". Representative White also gave a speech to this crowd on the palace steps although {{the exact nature of}} what he said is disputed. Opponents of the monarchy, especially the conservatives in the Reform Party, later claimed he gave an inflammatory and violent speech inciting the crowd to storm the palace and [...] "go in and kill and bury" [...] either the queen or her cabinet ministers. The speech may have been in Hawaiian and was only paraphrased in the English press. On January16, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, an English newspaper in Honolulu, sympathetic to the Reform Party, reported: ...|$|E
500|$|Following the announcement, {{the senior}} Cardinal Deacon retreats, and papal aides unfurl a large, maroon banner {{that out of}} {{practicality}} often bears the late pope's arms in the centre, draping it onto the railing of the Basilica's loggia. During Pope Francis' announcement, there was no image of his predecessor's arms (indicating that the previous pope was still alive), and during Pope Pius XI's first appearance following his election at the 1922 conclave, the banner showed the arms of Pope Pius IX instead of {{the arms of his}} immediate predecessor Pope Benedict XV. [...] The new pope then emerges <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to the adulation of the crowd, while a brass band in the forecourt below plays the Pontifical Anthem. He then imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing. The Pope may on this occasion choose to give the shorter episcopal blessing as his first Apostolic Blessing instead of the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing, this happened most recently with Pope Paul VI after his election at the 1963 conclave [...] Beginning with Pope John Paul II, the last three popes elected including Pope Francis, have chosen to address the crowds first before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing. [...] Also, at Pope Francis' first appearance, he led the faithful first in prayers for his predecessor and asked them for prayers for himself before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing.|$|E
2500|$|King {{had gone}} out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and was {{standing}} near his room when he was struck at 6:01p.m. by a single [...]30-06 bullet fired from a Remington Model 760 rifle. The bullet entered through King's right cheek, breaking his jaw and several vertebrae as it traveled down his spinal cord, severing his jugular vein and major arteries in the process, before lodging in his shoulder. The force of the shot ripped off King's necktie. King fell violently backward <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Outside, a {{large crowd}} of Native Hawaiians had gathered, expecting the Queen to {{proclaim}} a new constitution. However, after her meeting with her cabinet, Liliuokalani instead went outside <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> palace <b>balcony</b> and told <b>the</b> crowd that a new constitution {{would have to wait}} and that they should peacefully return to their homes.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} housed the {{sleeping}} quarters. Opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>balcony</b> was a guest's lounge. In all, twelve bedrooms were {{made available to}} guests on this floor, with a bathroom and linen room provided {{at each end of}} the building. A separate bathroom was to be provided at the rear for servants.|$|R
50|$|Omar spends {{several nights}} {{watching}} Monk's home with Butchie's friend Donnie, while both {{are unaware of}} the ambush. Omar breaks into the apartment with Donnie when he believes Monk is alone. Donnie is shot and killed and Omar shoots O-Dog in the leg. Omar is trapped by a hail of fire from Partlow, Snoop and Michael. Omar breaks through a nearby window <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> apartment <b>balcony</b> and disappears, having apparently jumped from <b>the</b> third-floor <b>balcony.</b> When Chris, Snoop and Michael look down from <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> Omar is gone.|$|R
2500|$|Czechoslovakia did {{not concern}} most people {{until the middle}} of September 1938, when they began to object to a small {{democratic}} state being bullied. Nevertheless, the initial response of the British public to the Munich agreement was generally favorable. As Chamberlain left for Munich in 1938, the whole House of Commons cheered him noisily. On 30 September, on his return to Britain, Chamberlain delivered his famous [...] "peace for our time" [...] speech to delighted crowds. He was invited by the Royal family <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> at Buckingham Palace before he had reported to Parliament. The agreement was supported by most of the press, only Reynold's News and the Daily Worker dissenting. In parliament the Labour Party opposed the agreement. Some Conservatives abstained in the vote. However, the only MP to advocate war was the Conservative Duff Cooper, who had resigned from the government in protest against the agreement.|$|E
2500|$|Believing that Milea {{had been}} murdered, rank-and-file {{soldiers}} switched {{sides to the}} revolution almost en masse. [...] The commanders wrote off Ceaușescu as a lost cause and {{made no effort to}} keep their men loyal to the government. Ceaușescu made a last desperate attempt to address the crowd gathered in front of the Central Committee building, but the people in the square began throwing stones and other projectiles at him, forcing him to take refuge in the building once more. [...] One group of protesters forced open the doors of the building, by now left unprotected. [...] They managed to overpower Ceaușescu's bodyguards and rushed through his office and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> [...] Although they did not know it, they were only a few meters from Ceaușescu, who was trapped in an elevator. [...] He, Elena and four others managed to get to the roof and escaped by helicopter, only seconds ahead of a group of demonstrators who had followed them there. [...] The PCR disappeared soon afterward; unlike its kindred parties in the former Soviet bloc, it has never been revived.|$|E
2500|$|On November 25, 1970, Mishima {{and four}} members of the Tatenokai, under pretext, visited the commandant of the Ichigaya Camp, the Tokyo {{headquarters}} of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair. With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was mocked and jeered. He finished his planned speech after a few minutes, returned to the commandant's office and committed seppuku. The assisting kaishakunin duty {{at the end of this}} ritual (to decapitate Mishima) had been assigned to Tatenokai member Masakatsu Morita, who was unable to properly perform the task. After several failed attempts at severing Mishima's head, he allowed another Tatenokai member, Hiroyasu Koga, to behead Mishima. Morita then knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga again performed the kaishakunin duty. This coup is called [...] in Japan.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} rooms have {{remained}} relatively unchanged, with twelve apartments, a store room, linen room and two bathrooms. The most notable {{additions to the}} apartments are plumbing and electrical, {{in the form of}} ensuites in all rooms, and kitchenettes in some. The two front bay bedrooms are reserved for the proprietors and the hallway that led <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>balcony</b> has been closed off.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} walls are red face brickwork {{with the main}} facade and the Gregory Terrace elevation designed {{with some of the}} characteristics of the stripped classical style. The main eastern facade and entrance to the building is from within the Showgrounds. This is a two-storey section which has food shops at ground level and offices and meeting rooms on the first floor level. The two principal entrances to the building are openings large enough to accommodate trucks and other vehicles. The entrances are emphasised by stylised columns, capitals and entablatures with balconies above. Sets of three French doors open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> <b>The</b> food shops have metal security doors that open upwards. The first floor level is delineated on the facade by a rendered stringcourse. All the windows on the upper level have round headed windows containing steel framed eight pane casements. The panels below the windows contain a decorative pattern of brickwork. The building has been extended to the northwest and this extension is distinguished on the facade by mottled patterned brickwork, simplified detailing, large multi-paned window and corrugated metal sun shading.|$|R
50|$|The library on {{the first}} floor has been altered and is now a meeting room with {{adjacent}} offices and catering area. This area opens <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>balcony,</b> which affords sweeping views across Victoria Park, Victoria Park Golf Course, Queensland University of Technology Kelvin Grove Campus and over towards Gregory Terrace and beyond to Mt Coot-tha. Shelving and display cupboards from the ground floor have been relocated to the former library. The doors to <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> have a shallow external awning supported by decorative consoles and are flanked by bronze torch globe lamps. <b>The</b> <b>balcony</b> is defined by the giant order columns separated by decorative wrought iron balustrading. Both sets of doors to the former library have decorative leadlight glazing panels and fanlights.|$|R
2500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the polls closed at 4:00pm on April 9, 2000, major news {{networks}} rushed to announce that Toledo had garnered more votes than Fujimori. These announcements were based on projections from Peru's top polling firms, which base their numbers on exit polls. The prominent pollsters quickly modified projections based on samples of actual vote counts from selected polling places, {{better known as the}} [...] "quick count". Shortly after receiving news of Toledo's encouraging performance in the initial stage of the vote count, supporters gathered in the streets around Toledo's hotel room. An enthusiastic Toledo walked out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of his room wearing a red headband, reminiscent of ancient Inca warriors. He optimistically speculated that a first round victory might be within his grasp but still urged his supporters to wait for the results of the quick count. The second wave of quick count results reversed earlier projections, projecting a round one Fujimori plurality and possible majority. Fujimori had a projected lead of 48.73% to 41.03% later that evening. Fujimori was closing in on the 50% mark which would give him a victory in the first round, with no runoff necessary.|$|E
60|$|A half moon {{hung over}} the flat roofs {{and the air was}} very still. Walthew and Grahame sat on a balcony {{surrounding}} the patio of Don Martin Sarmiento's house. The lattice windows that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> had old but artistic hinges of bronze, and the crumbling hardwood rails showed traces of skilful carving. Below, a small fountain splashed in a marble basin surrounded by palmettos, and a creeper covered a trellis with trails of dusky purple. A faint smell of decay mingled with the more pungent odors of garlic and olive oil from the kitchen in the courtyard, where a clatter was going on, but no sound from outside broke the silence. Rio Frio was very quiet now.|$|E
