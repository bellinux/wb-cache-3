Furthermore, we conclude that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s findings of aggravating circumstances. We note that <b>our</b> <b>review</b> of the defendant’s sentence is not yet complete. Only after additional briefing and oral argument on comparative proportionality under RSA 630:5, XI(c) will we conclude <b>our</b> <b>review</b> of the defendant’s sentence of death, at which time we will issue a further opinion.” As to the open question, the relevant statute reads, [...] "XI. With regard to the sentence the supreme court shall determine: ...(c) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant." ...|$|E

It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.|$|E

We have become {{somewhat}} notorious in Landcare circles for these reviews. Because we did have such a strong view of the 1994 conference, we {{looked forward to the}} 1997 conference to see what it would reflect of Landcare, and to see whether the organisers would address any of our criticisms.

[...] Comey conceded, [...] "Based on <b>our</b> <b>review,</b> we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July." [...] While the e-mail matter is resolved, legal questions on Comey's actions remain. [...] Comey and the FBI have been broadly criticized on the editorial pages from both the right and the left, with headlines reading: [...] "James Comey should be fired" [...] (Chicago Tribune); [...] "FBI chief James Comey should resign" [...] (The Washington Times); [...] and [...] "FBI Director James Comey is Unfit for Public Service" [...] (Newsweek). On November 12, 2016, unsuccessful presidential candidate Hillary Clinton directly attributed her election loss to FBI Director James Comey.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{as with most}} meat products, {{producers}} of bacon have received heavy criticism for how their pigs are treated. Many petitions and protests have been made trying to raise awareness and change how producers treat their pigs. Many of these protests have turned out successful: for example, following NBC News's report of an undercover investigation of an abusive pig farm, Tyson Foods terminated their contract with the pig farm. Similar to NBC's investigation, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) investigated Seaboard Foods, one of the pig breeding facilities that supply Walmart. According to HSUS, the pigs were treated poorly and abused. Walmart spokesperson Diana Gee said, [...] "As soon as we were {{made aware of the}} allegations, we immediately reached out to Seaboard to begin investigating the issue... Pending <b>our</b> <b>review,</b> we will take any action necessary." [...] Petitions also exist that oppose poor treatment of pigs, many of which state that the current treatment of pigs in factories is cruel and unethical.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{state and}} federal {{government}} agencies mounted investigations into the crisis, {{the most prominent of}} which was the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, created by Jimmy Carter in April 1979. The commission consisted of a panel of twelve people, specifically chosen for their lack of strong pro- or anti-nuclear views, and headed by chairman John G. Kemeny, president of Dartmouth College. It was instructed to produce a final report within six months, and after public hearings, depositions, and document collection, released a completed study on October 31, 1979. The investigation strongly criticized Babcock & Wilcox, Met Ed, GPU, and the NRC for lapses in quality assurance and maintenance, inadequate operator training, lack of communication of important safety information, poor management, and complacency, but avoided drawing conclusions {{about the future of the}} nuclear industry. The heaviest criticism from the Kemeny Commission concluded that [...] "fundamental changes were necessary in the organization, procedures, practices 'and above all – in the attitudes' of the NRC [...] " [...] Kemeny said that the actions taken by the operators were [...] "inappropriate" [...] but that the workers [...] "were operating under procedures that they were required to follow, and <b>our</b> <b>review</b> and study of those indicates that the procedures were inadequate" [...] and that the control room [...] "was greatly inadequate for managing an accident." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with <b>our</b> <b>review</b> [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E
