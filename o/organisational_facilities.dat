Although such a strategy is efficient on an individual basis, {{it has been shown that}} it only has a limited impact on the overall rate of infections in the population. Public health authorities were therefore prompted to additionally recommend a universal vaccination strategy to reduce and ultimately eliminate hepatitis B infections. The option to primarily vaccinate infants, adolescents or both age groups depends on the epidemiological situation of a country, the availability of <b>organisational</b> <b>facilities,</b> financial resources and acceptability. Combining a targeted and a universal vaccination strategy provides the optimal protection against hepatitis B, both at an individual and population level...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} four organisational predictor variables {{and the degree of}} occupational expertise of higher-level employees in three different career stages. The factors in question are: social support from immediate supervisor, social support from near colleagues, <b>organisational</b> <b>facilities</b> and attention from immediate supervisor for a further career development. Hypotheses have been tested with original survey data from 420 higher-level employees and 224 direct supervisors working in large organisations both in the profit and in the non-profit sector. The results indicate that the focus of attention is, in general, restricted to the employee's present contribution and to the familiar job domain. Activities aimed at enlarging the outlook are virtually non-existent. That is to say, management has a preoccupation with instrumental leadership, i. e. aimed at the here-and-now and less future-oriented, instead of appropriate people management. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{health risks}} are {{increasingly}} regarded as complex issues. Complex problems, also labelled ill-defined, wicked or messy, {{are characterized by}} radical uncertainty, a plurality of legitimate perspectives and an unclear sense of all consequences and/or cumulative impact of collective action. Complexity goes parallel with three related shifts: (i) beyond the traditional positivistic epistemology, characterized by rationality, full knowability and disciplinary reductionism, (ii) beyond the traditional sectoral policy arrangements, as complex issues transcend these traditional policy fields, (iii) a shift towards new arrangements in the science policy interface, as science {{is no longer the}} unquestioned source of legitimacy for policy arguments. To summarize, complexity challenges traditional boundaries and stimulates cross- boundary arrangements at three levels: between scientific disciplines, between policy fields and between science and policy. As a consequence, complexity asks for new epistemological and methodological tools and for novel institutions. All these shifts apply in particular to the environmental health domain. Starting from these epistemological and institutional perspectives, this PhD-project analyses Flemish environmental health policy arrangements and their recent developments. Based on document analysis and interviews, it analyses the relationship between science and policy in the environmental health domain over the last three decades, and tries to explain its changes - and continuities -. Moreover, it aims at assessing the effectiveness of these novel <b>organisational</b> <b>facilities</b> and methodological tools, albeit it {{through the eyes of the}} stakeholders, when it comes to deal with complexity and uncertainty. In this respect, the Flemish Environmental Health Network is emblematic: it was established in response to the dioxin crises related to incinerators located in residential areas. The network aimed at the actual participation of diverse stakeholders at different policy levels to improve the cooperation and communication between science, politics and society on the one hand, and between environment and health on the other hand. The case exemplifies how the then predominating Flemish environmental health policy arrangement was challenged by a (dioxin) crisis, and how this crisis in turn induced an epistemological and an organisational renewal. Part of this renewal is the development of new tools and methodologies (e. g. a programme of biomonitoring, an action plan to translate biomonitoring data into policy priorities & measures, a guideline to risk communication) and new organisations and platforms (e. g. the Flemish Environmental Health Network; the Flemish Centre of Expertise for Environment and Health). status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{sustainable}} approach {{recognizes that}} there are potential benefits from holistic thinking, and must engage project funding, design, occupation and <b>organisational</b> and <b>facilities</b> management.

This paper considers {{the starting point for}} a holistic approach to workplace productivity. In particular this is {{from the point of view}} of practitioners at the coal-face, undertaking design and specification of the built environment and how it interfaces with organizations and individuals. Successes and lessons learnt are offered, and strategies to engage the wider design team, cost consultant, client and occupier are offered. The opportunities for enabling creative and productive working environments are explored by case studies. These also demonstrate the benefits of full and active engagement in workplace productivity thinking for the occupying business or organization. Workplace performance can be measured and fed back into building design provided that a holistic approach is adopted. The funding, design and construction of projects can be driven by improved business performance of the occupants and their social needs creating a profitable whole that 2 is truly sustainable, and better design. The Building Environmental Engineer has the opportunity to be a catalyst for this fascinating and now main-stream way of designing. ...|$|R
40|$|New Ways of Working (NewWoW) {{are popular}} for {{increasing}} employee and <b>organisational</b> effectiveness. <b>Facility</b> management (FM) aligns by aiming for {{higher levels of}} employee satisfaction and cost savings with introducing the shared features and facilities of activity based working (ABW). However, lack of proof of desired advantages of NewWoW is feeding a more reserved attitude towards NewWoW. Previous studies on employee satisfaction have used either single case studies or focus on one country. Also, many studies do not distinguish clearly between features and facilities. This study aims to identify differences between traditional and ABW environments in supporting workplace satisfaction. Questionnaires amongst 47, 913 office employees, mainly in Western European organizations, provided answers on 31 workplace features, fifteen facilities and employee satisfaction in the period 2010 - 2014. Respondents were split in two groups: ABW environments versus traditional work environments. Factor analyses identified ten components of the work environment that influence satisfaction. Independent samples t-tests were used to identify significant differences between both groups on their satisfaction with the work environment factors. Besides ‘ICT & equipment’, all factors showed significant differences in satisfaction between both groups. NewWoW employees are more satisfied with seclusion rooms, climate, décor, cleanliness and leisure. The traditional work environments show higher levels of satisfaction with desk/chair, privacy, storage and general facilities. These results provide FM with insight how to increase satisfaction in both types of offices...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} an invited {{contribution}} {{for a special}} edition of the Facilities journal titled ‘Creative facilities’. It reported on research undertaken by Greene to observe different knowledge workers’ mobility patterns as a way of understanding their respective spatial needs. This focus contrasts with previous classifications that have differentiated knowledge workers by generation (Steelcase 2006), activity (Duffy et al. 1998) or technology use (Davenport 2005). Greene developed a novel visual research tool for interview use, which encouraged participants to describe working patterns and habits in ways often difficult to vocalise. This research gave designers and facilities managers insights into different needs of knowledge workers, commonly treated as a homogeneous group. The four knowledge worker ‘character types’ identified in the research – the ‘Anchor’, ‘Connector’, ‘Gatherer’ and ‘Navigator’ – have become active tools for improved design briefing in planning responsive workspaces that are supportive of employees. Knowledge worker productivity is a central topic of research for <b>organisational</b> and <b>facility</b> management (Davenport 2002; Duffy 2005). Many organisations have adopted the open-plan office as a generic design solution, ignoring the creative and autonomous characteristics of a knowledge worker. Greene and Myerson take a people-centred approach to the topic, drawing on their work in the cross-disciplinary research project Welcoming Workplace (AHRC/EPSRC, 2007 – 8), which showed that people’s individual ways of working need to be supported with a variety of workplace settings. The typologies and the graphic tool were developed into a workshop held at the ‘Include’ conference (UK, 2009) and ‘European Business Workshops in Inclusive Design’ (Norway, 2010). Greene also led further {{research in the area of}} workplace design and mobile working through the projects Living Library (funded by Haworth, 2010) and Mobile Working Lives (funded by Samsung Design Europe, 2012).

Puerperal sepsis is an infection contracted during childbirth and one of the commonest causes of maternal mortality in developing countries, despite the discovery of antibiotics over eighty years ago. Infections can be contracted during childbirth either in the community or in health facilities. Some developing countries have recently experienced increased use of health facilities for labour and delivery care and {{there is a possibility that}} this trend could lead to rising rates of puerperal sepsis. Drug and technological developments need to be combined with effective health system interventions to reduce infections, including puerperal sepsis. This article reviews health system infection control measures pertinent to labour and delivery units in developing country health <b>facilities.</b> <b>Organisational</b> improvements, training, surveillance and continuous quality improvement initiatives, used alone or in combination have been shown to decrease infection rates in some clinical settings. There is limited evidence available on effective infection control measures during labour and delivery and from low resource settings. A health systems approach is necessary to reduce maternal mortality and the occurrence of infections resulting from childbirth. Organisational and behavioural change underpins the success of infection control interventions.

There are different examples of landbridges with different characteristics related to transport supply <b>facilities,</b> <b>organisational</b> structure and managerial skills. Certain limitations of existing landbridge studies are discussed. They include {{the failure of a}} comprehensive academic study to account jointly for both demand and supply of landbridge services. Most articles on landbridges discuss the Trans-Siberian Railway or east-west coast landbridges of the United States of America. No comprehensive academic studies of landbridges in general were found. The main features of the research can be summarised as: *A comprehensive review of literature related to landbridges * An investigation and analysis of Iranian transport supply and demand including both domestic and foreign trade. * An investigation and analysis of the demand of the Central Asian and Caucasus countries (Former USSR republics) for transport * The development of a demand and supply model related to an Iranian Sea-landbridge (ISLB) for eight Central Asian and Caucasus countries and Iran. * Evaluation of the impacts of demand on landbridge supply. *A comprehensive review of the scenario approach and its application to the Iranian Sea landbridge study using a regression technique. Three scenarios are developed (optimistic, most probable and pessimistic).

40|$|Background In western Kenya, {{maternal}} mortality {{is a major}} public health problem estimated at 730 / 100, 000 live births, higher than the Kenyan national average of 488 / 100, 000 women. Many women do not attend antenatal care (ANC) in the first trimester, half do not receive 4 ANC visits. A high proportion use traditional birth attendants (TBA) for delivery and 1 in five deliver unassisted. The present study was carried out to ascertain why women do not fully utilise health facility ANC and delivery services. Methods A qualitative study using 8 focus group discussions each consisting of 8 – 10 women, aged 15 – 49 years. Thematic analysis identified the main barriers and facilitators to health facility based ANC and delivery. Results Attending health facility for ANC was viewed positively. Three elements of care were important; testing for disease including HIV, checking {{the position of the}} foetus, and receiving injections and / or medications. Receiving a bed net and obtaining a registration card were also valuable. Four barriers to attending a health facility for ANC were evident; attitudes of clinic staff, long clinic waiting times, HIV testing and cost, although not all women felt the cost was prohibitive being worth it for the health of the child. Most women preferred to deliver in a health facility due to better management of complications. However cost was a barrier, and a reason to visit a TBA because of flexible payment. Other barriers were unpredictable labour and transport, staff attitudes and husbands’ preference. Conclusions Our findings suggest that women in western Kenya are amenable to ANC and would be willing and even prefer to deliver in a healthcare facility, if it were affordable and accessible to them. However for this to happen there needs to be investment in health promotion, and transport, as well as reducing or removing all fees associated with antenatal and delivery care.

40|$|The {{health of}} mothers and {{neonates}} is a concern for many countries, because they form the future of every society. In Ghana efforts {{have been made to}} address quality health care in order to accelerate progress in maternal and child health and reduce maternal and neonatal mortality through the implementation of a number of polices including a fee exemption for pregnant women for antenatal, delivery and postnatal care and a national health insurance scheme among others. However these interventions have not led to an improvement in the quality of health care and concerns have been raised whether health workers are sufficiently motivated to provide health care that is responsive to the needs {{of mothers and}} children. This study set out to study motivation as an individual quality of the worker, however it became obvious in the analytical phase that motivation is an outcome of interactions between the worker and the work environment. So the research resorted to analyse and understand the various ways in which interpersonal interactions and organisational processes contribute to the motivation of health workers and quality of care in a Ghanaian hospital setting. The research tried to answer the following questions: what are the interpersonal processes that influence health worker motivation; what are the organisational and managerial processes that influence health worker motivation; how does the setup of the Ghana health sector and its associated policies influence health worker motivation and how does health worker motivation influence health worker response to client health needs? The research focused on the quality of interpersonal interaction, such as attitudes, motivation, trust and conflict, on a number of organizational characteristics such as power relations, power being defined as the ability to affect organizational outcomes, uncertainty in decision-making and the provision of resources to deliver quality health care and on wider policy-making that affects the ability of health care institutions {{to take care of the}} staff (remuneration, human resource management) and the decision-making space of health facility managers. In order to investigate health worker motivation in a real life setting ethnographic research was conducted for twenty months in two hospitals; a specialist referral hospital and a district hospital that offer basic maternal and child health services in the greater Accra region in  Ghana. Between 2011 and 2013, data was collected in mostly the maternity and new-born units of both hospitals. The researcher interacted  with  hospital  staff  including  nurses, doctors,  anaesthetists,  orderlies, laboratory technicians, accounts officers and managers and collected data on daily activities and interactions in the hospital environment. The hospitals, which had different characteristics, were not selected for comparative purposes, but to enable a better understanding of how the organizational context influences worker motivation. Conversations were useful in helping the researcher to understand social phenomena. Interviews were conducted to explore social phenomena in depth. Participant observation was also a very important tool in helping the researcher to observe at first- hand how health care is provided in a natural hospital environment. An important source of information consisted of the reactions of hospital staff on the research and the researcher and the researcher’s emotional reactions to this, as it helped her to experience motivation, which was very useful in understanding and analysing motivational processes in the hospital environment. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review board (approval number GHS-ERC: 06 / 01 / 12) and the proposal was reviewed by the Wageningen School of Social Sciences board. Written informed consent was obtained from all interview participants. Verbal consent was obtained for conversations and pseudonyms are used for the names of the study hospitals and frontline workers throughout the thesis. Interpersonal processes including limited interaction and communication between collaborating frontline workers and perceived disrespect from colleagues and managers contributed to poor relations between frontline workers. A high number of frontline workers engaged in locum (private practice) in private hospitals. Such workers came to work late, or left early and some even skipped their official work to engage in locum practice. Workers also believed that some of their colleagues sneaked in their clients from their locum site to the hospital and charged them illegal fees, which they did not share with colleagues. Such practices and perceptions contributed to distrust relations among workers and to a poor organisational climate, which resulted in demotivation of staff, poor collaboration in the provision of health care, and eventually to conflicts. Conflicts contributed to delays in the provision of care and those who were willing to work felt disempowered, as they were unable to marshal their resources with collaborating professionals to respond to clients’ needs. They also contributed to angry and bitter workers and negative perceptions of other professional groups. Sometimes cases were postponed and on some occasions clients had to be referred to other <b>facilities.</b> <b>Organisational</b> and managerial processes equally influenced health worker motivation in various ways. Health workers perceived distributive, procedural and interactional injustice in organisational and managerial processes as they perceived that managers were not responding to their personal and organisational needs, which compromised their ability to offer quality health care. Health workers perceived distributive injustice in the fact that they worked hard and deserved to be given incentives to offset the stoppage of bonuses that the government initially paid to workers when the fee exemption for maternal health was introduced. Workers felt their managers were not meeting the hospitals’ needs for essential medical supplies, equipment and were incapable of putting up appropriate infrastructure to accommodate workers and an overwhelming number of clients. They perceived interactional injustice because of the fact that managers did not communicate with them on decisions that affected them and that managers were out of touch with the needs of workers. They complained that they were not respected by their superiors, who shouted at them when they made mistakes, and suggested that managers and superiors did not treat them with dignity in matters of discipline. Workers further argued that managers did not care whether they had adequate workforce to support them to provide quality health care. Some felt overworked and some felt burn out. However, managers felt disempowered at their level as well. The setup of the Ghana health sector and its associated policies remains largely centralised, so managers who are expected to meet the needs of frontline health workers and their hospitals, do not have the power to do so. They could not beef up staff numbers, since recruitment and allocation of staff to health facilities is centralised. In addition, managers received little financial support to run their hospitals. Their main source of funding was from reimbursement of funds from the National Health Insurance Authority, but reimbursement usually delayed for up to six months and they did not receive subvention from the Ghana Health Service or the Ministry of Health (MOH) to run their hospitals, so they were always cash strapped. Also the MOH, which is the body responsible for putting up infrastructure, could not meet the infrastructure needs of the hospitals. Additionally managers had to deal with conflicting policies including procurement policies that made decisions on purchasing essential supplies and drugs bureaucratic and slowed managers’ response to frontline worker and organisational needs. As a result, managers faced uncertainty in securing human and physical resources. To cope with uncertainties managers had to distribute their funds thinly among competing priorities of worker and organisational needs. At times managers had to sacrifice certain needs of workers and their hospitals in order to meet others. Consequently, workers lost trust in managers, which demotivated them in the provision of health care. Also the fee exemption policy made health care accessible to the general populace, but it did not lead to a commensurate increase in  salaries, infrastructure development and increase in staff numbers. For that matter managers and frontline workers were overwhelmed with client numbers and had to turn some away. Both hospital managers and frontline workers perceived that policy makers and their superiors were not interested in how they provided care to clients or even their own safety, which demotivated them. It is important to note that some workers were observed to be intrinsically motivated and responded to the health needs of clients, despite the fact that they faced similar challenges as those who were demotivated. Such workers explained that their sources of motivation included a belief in a supreme being, the desire to maintain work standards and others perceived that clients had a right to quality health care. Also some indicated that they derived inner satisfaction when they were able to provide quality care to clients. Demotivation contributed to absenteeism, workers reporting to work late and some closing early as strategies to avoid collaborating with colleagues that they did not feel comfortable working with, which further worsened the conflict situation. Some workers also picked and chose to work with particular professionals. Workers exercised power negatively in two ways: 1. Some workers exhibited negative attitudes towards their colleagues, which contributed to poor interaction and poor communication. It further created gaps in clinical decision making. 2. Workers transferred their frustrations and disappointments to clients by shouting at clients and insulting them, which compromised with the quality of care that clients received. Another important consequence of demotivation was that workers got angry, some felt frustrated, and some reported experiencing high blood pressure. Consequently it affected the wellbeing of health workers who were supposed to cater for clients. Also demotivation became so deeply seated in some workers that they appeared to be beyond redemption. Some even hated the hospital environment that they worked in and others chose to leave the hospital. For health workers to be able to respond to the health needs of clients who visit the hospital there is the need that their personal needs including demand for better terms and conditions of service, incentives and training needs are catered for. Also their organisational needs including demand for essential supplies, equipment, appropriate infrastructure among others need to be addressed. Additionally managers have to be transparent, communicate and interact more frequently with frontline workers to enable them appreciate managers’ efforts in meeting workers’ personal and organisational needs. Also for managers to be able to meet the needs of frontline workers and their organisations managers must be given the power to make decisions on human and other resources. Also managers should be supported with the necessary funds, so that they can meet the multiple needs of their workers and hospitals. Health worker motivation in the hospital context is determined by an interaction of interpersonal and organisational processes that are shaped by external and internal influencers, who exercise power in their bid to influence organisational outcomes. Thus this study contributes to theory by propounding that motivation is not an individual quality of the worker, but it is an outcome of interactions between the worker and the work environment. Also power and trust relations within and outside the hospital influence worker motivation and for that matter theories on organisational power and trust relations are central to understanding and analysing worker motivation...|$|R
