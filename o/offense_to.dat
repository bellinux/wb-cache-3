Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the Tide was trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his <b>offense</b> <b>to</b> try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Maryland {{was able}} to hold the nation's third-ranked rushing <b>offense</b> <b>to</b> just 114yards on the ground.

5|$|Just as {{the first}} half was {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second was no different with both Alabama and LSU only managing a pair of field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each <b>offense</b> <b>to</b> less than 300 yards of total offense with each having a pair of interceptions.
