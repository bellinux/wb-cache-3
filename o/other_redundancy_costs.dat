This work explores redundancy, which is a well-known fault tolerance technique, for variation tolerance.

40|$|A {{fault-tolerant}} {{approach for}} application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) {{to reduce the}} cost of classical fault-tolerant mechanisms is presented in this paper. The ASIP is synthesized from an object-oriented high-level description by a hardware-software co-design approach and consists of a processor core along with some functional units. In the proposed fault-tolerant methodology, upon detecting a fault in a hardware functional unit, this unit is replaced by an equivalent software version. To evaluate the fault-tolerant approach, a JPEG processor is used. The analytical and experimental results show that the approach can tolerate functional-unit faults with no area/cost overhead. However, by using the functional-unit fault-tolerant approach along with the traditional duplication approach, we can make a tradeoff between area overhead and performance degradation. In addition, the processor core of the ASIP has been made fault-tolerant with lower area overhead than the traditional duplication method by putting a simpler application specific core as a redundant module for the main processor. Keeping only the data paths used by the running application in the redundant core enables us to reduce the <b>redundancy</b> <b>cost</b> with no performance overhead...|$|R

If t is big enough, we say, t[*]=[*]C[*]−[*] 1, the error will pollute nearly all the observations. Even if the error pollute nearly all the observations, this scheme also can correct the error by adding t redundancy packets and send both parity symbols and hash values over secret channel. The size of parity symbols and hash values reach k 2 /j which can be neglected. However, the redundancy (t redundancy packets) is too much which results in a low information rate ultimately. What is nice is that this scheme can correct errors beyond dmin/ 2 though the <b>redundancy</b> <b>cost</b> is expensive. Based on the traditional block code, we cannot correct errors beyond dmin/ 2. However, the fifth method also cannot correct propagated error which is t[*]=[*]C. However, it certainly draws some inspiration and reference to the error correction when t[*]=[*]C.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} multi-site declustering strategies with self repair for databases demanding very high service availability. Existing work on declustering strategies are centered around providing high performance and reliability inside a small geographical area (site). Applications demanding robustness against site failures like fire and power outages, can not use these methods. Such applications will often both replicate information inside one site and then replicate the site on another site and thus resulting in unnecessary high <b>redundancy</b> <b>cost.</b> Multi-site declustering provides robustness against site failures with only two replicas of data without compromising the performance and reliability. Self repair is proposed for reducing the probability of double-failures causing data loss and reducing the need for rapid replacement of failed hardware. A prerequisite for multi-site declustering with self repair is fast, long-distance, communication networks like ATM.

40|$|We generalize the {{integrated}} system model of Smith and Ratcliff (2009) {{to obtain a}} new theory of attentional selection in brief, multielement visual displays. The theory proposes that attentional selection occurs via competitive interactions among detectors that signal the presence of task-relevant features at particular display locations. The outcome of the competition, together with attention, determines which stimuli are selected into visual short-term memory (VSTM). Decisions about the contents of VSTM are made by a diffusion-process decision stage. The selection process is modeled by coupled systems of shunting equations, which perform gated where-on-what pathway VSTM selection. The theory provides a computational account of key findings from attention tasks with near-threshold stimuli.

40|$|Seismic {{data are}} subject to {{different}} kinds of unwanted perturbations. These random or organised noises, which can be acquisition or processing related for instance, may disturb geophysical interpretations and thwart attempts at automated processing methods. Since the relative features (e. g. amplitude, spectrum) of the signals of interest and the noises may vary locally, signal and noise separation is obtained by a local data-driven filtering with two or three-dimensional oversampled complex filter banks. Filter banks in general decompose the noisy data onto frequency bands and directions on restricted subregions (sub-images or sub-volumes), acting like a local FK with improved properties. The transforms studied in this work present sub-regions smooth overlapping, to avoid tiling effects while allowing signal reconstruction from the transformed domain. The proposed methodology uses limited redundancy filtering that both yield enhanced noise robustness (due to oversampling) and tractable 2 D or 3 D processing, since they are optimized to limit the <b>redundancy</b> <b>cost.</b> Coupling those redundant transforms with a processing method designed to detect and compute locally dominant directions, and to remove unwanted directions and random noise, leads to good visual results.

In this context, {{it is critical}} to design a data collection protocol that enables retrieving the data from the vehicles in almost real-time in an efficient way for urban scenarios. We propose Back off-based Per-hop Forwarding (BPF), a broadcast-based receiver-oriented protocol that uses the des-tination location information to select the forwarding order among the nodes receiving the packet. BFP does not require nodes to exchange periodic messages with their neighbors communicating their locations to keep a low management message overhead. It uses geographic information about the final destination node in the header of each data packet to route it in a hop-by-hop basis. It takes advantage of redundant forwarding to increase packet delivery to a destination, what is more critical in an urban scenario than in a highway, where the road topology does not represent a challenge for forwarding. We evaluate the performance of the BPF protocol using ns- 3 and a Manhattan grid topology and compare it with well-known broadcast suppression techniques.
