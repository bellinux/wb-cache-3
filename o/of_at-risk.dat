40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a non-formal education program based on Transformative Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Modification Concept to enhance drug abuse resilience quotient <b>of</b> youth <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> drug relapse. The research procedure is divided into three phases: 1) to study the learner's need about the program to build the resilience quotient for the youth <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> drug relapse, 2) to develop the non-formal education program to build the resilience quotient for the youth <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> drug relapse, and 3) to study the impacts of the program application. The design of this study was the quasi-experimental research approach with two - group pretest and posttest. The experimental group consisted of 30 relapse drug at-risk youth who used the developed program. The controlled group consisted of 30 relapse drug at-risk youth who used the drug addicted treatment. Both groups were in the congested community in Klongtoey district, Bangkok, Thailand. The effects were compared between two groups by using t-test. The results showed that the youth preferred interactive activities such as game, role play to lecture and the experimental group gain more drug abuse resilience quotient than controlled group significantly. In conclusion, a non-formal education program based on transformative learning to enhance drug abuse resilience quotient <b>of</b> youth <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> drug relapse is suitable...|$|R

25|$|As {{discussed}} above, concrete is {{very strong}} in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads.

40|$|The face of America’s {{schools is}} changing. An {{increasingly}} diverse and challenging population of students blends assorted ethnic backgrounds, varied approaches to learning, and different socio-economic backgrounds into one student body. Faced {{with the realities}} of environmental and educational stressors, some students may find the educational milieu difficult. One particular group of students who may fit this category are those placed <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> school failure. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, the latest government reform in education to affect our nation’s schools, created additional pressures on educators and students alike. In this climate of increased testing and accountability, educators must be trained to work with today’s students. Staff development is one method of assisting educators to become knowledgeable about the needs <b>of</b> students placed <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> school failure in the current reform era. Guiding issues for this study were the nature of staff development with regard to students placed <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> school failure in an era of educational reform as viewed through staff development. Guiding questions were how many staff development courses were aimed at meeting the needs <b>of</b> students placed <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> school failure and how much of this training was done relative to content-based staff development.

25|$|Regular active surveillance, {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control sleeping sickness. Systematic screening <b>of</b> <b>at-risk</b> communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of sexual transmission of West African sleeping sickness has been reported.|$|E

50|$|The {{study found}} that in the United States, over 5 million seniors, (11.4% of all seniors), {{experience}} some form of food insecurity, i.e. were marginally food insecure. Of these, about 2.5 million are <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hunger, and about 750,000 suffer from hunger due to financial constraints. Some groups of seniors {{are more likely to}} be <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hunger. Relative to their representation in the overall senior population, those with limited incomes, under age 70, African-Americans, Hispanics, never-married individuals, renters, and persons living in the southern United States are all more likely to be <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hunger. While certain groups of seniors are at greater-risk of hunger, hunger cuts across the income spectrum. For example, over 50% of all seniors who are <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hunger have incomes above the poverty threshold. Likewise, it is present in all demographic groups. For example, over two-thirds <b>of</b> seniors <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hunger are caucasian. There are marked differences in the risk of hunger across family structure, especially for those seniors living alone, or those living with a grandchild. Those living alone are twice as likely to experience hunger compared to married seniors. One in five senior households with a grandchild, but no adult child, present is at risk of hunger, compared to about one in twenty households without a grandchild present. Seniors living in non-metropolitan areas are as likely to experience food insecurity as those living in metropolitan areas, suggesting that food insecurity cuts across the urban-rural continuum.|$|R

500|$|Testing {{before the}} onset of {{symptoms}} is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% <b>of</b> <b>at-risk</b> individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels {{have been found to be}} lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. [...] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.|$|E

40|$|The central purpose {{addressed}} {{for this}} dissertation {{study was to}} examine the effects of an intensive early literacy support program on the phonological processing skills <b>of</b> kindergarten children <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> EBD. Some research suggests that these children do not improve from generally effective early literacy support interventions. As a result, these children have recently been described as treatment resisters—children who fail to acquire phonological processing skills within the normal range after treatment. But the conclusion that children <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> EBD are treatment resisters may be premature due to the methodological and design limitations of previous research. The primary purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of an intensive early literacy support program on the phonological processing skills <b>of</b> kindergarten children <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> EBD using a true experimental design. ^ A total of 36 kindergarten children <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> EBD participated in this study.

Children in the experimental condition received an early literacy support program for 10 to 15 minutes daily over five weeks. Three primary dependent measures were used in this study: the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) (Wagner, Torgesen, 2 ̆ 6 Rashotte, 1999); the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Kaminski 2 ̆ 6 Good, 1996); and treatment fidelity measures. ^ Treatment fidelity according to tutor self-evaluations and independent direct observation was 97...|$|R
40|$|While {{homelessness}} is {{a growing}} problem in Greater Vancouver, immigrants are not yet a visible part of the region's homeless. The over-representation of immigrants among the population considered at-risk suggests that immigrant homelessness remains hidden. Using census-based housing indicators, we examine the geographies <b>of</b> immigrants <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> homelessness to discern where 'hidden' homelessness might be occurring. Findings indicate that: spatial concentrations <b>of</b> recent immigrants <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> homelessness are found in inner suburban locations; in these at-risk areas {{the vast majority of}} immigrants are recent arrivals; and recent immigrants are disproportionately excluded from at-risk estimates because they are significantly over-represented among households that have shelter costs that exceed their incomes (which are excluded by the indicator). These conclusions are reached through analysis at the regional and sub-regional scale, which revealed broad trends and patterns, and a second small-area (neighbourhood) scale analysis, a means of better documenting the highly-localized geography of low-cost rental housing, revealing fine-grained patterns of social difference, that in Greater Vancouver identify areas where 'hidden' homelessness may be present...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{questions}} whether the experiences <b>of</b> women <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) might be genetically exceptional. Using {{a combination of}} retrospective in-depth interviews with women <b>at-risk</b> and observations <b>of</b> consultations carried out at a regional specialist centre, this research questions the genetic exceptionalism thesis and {{the argument that the}} experiences and decisions that women <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> HBOC make, are unique and thus different compared to those of women diagnosed with non-genetic, sporadically developing breast or ovarian cancer. In examining the arguments for and against genetic exceptionalism, this thesis revisits the medical sociological literature on the doctor-patient relationship and discusses the difficulty in establishing who should be recognised to be the patient within the genetic consultation, the decision to undergo genetic testing and the decision to have risk-reducing, prophylactic surgery. The resulting analysis recognises the data to be moral accounts, constructed by research participants so that their utterances would be perceived in a particular manner. For example, while justifying their reported actions, participants were attempting to portray themselves as moral, responsible citizens, mothers, patients and women. In addressing these four aspects of women’s HBOC experiences, this thesis concludes that there is little unfamiliar to medical sociologists about the experiences described and the rationales given by the participants. Such data lends itself to the position where the notion of genetic exceptionalism cannot be supported. Consequently, the thesis concludes that the experiences <b>of</b> women <b>at-risk</b> <b>of</b> HBOC seem to be little different from other, non-genetic health experiences.
