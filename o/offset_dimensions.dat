40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{method is}} applied to update finite element models of welded joints and the boundary condition of a cantilever plate. Careful parameterisation {{is found to be}} critical in updating joints and boundary conditions, and the merits of geometric parameters are given special consideration. The use of nodal <b>offset</b> <b>dimensions</b> results in an updated model of the welded joint with physical interpretation. Similarly the ‘‘rigid’ ’ boundary in a cantilever plate is successfully updated using the effective length of the elements closest to the joint. In all cases an improvement on the analytical natural frequencies is demonstrated. 7 1996 Academic Press Limited 1...|$|E

Your goal is to give foundation and encou- raging voluntary action of the municipalities in the search for conservation and expansion of areas of forest composition, water resources and traditional communities, the expansion of tax revenues, but without compromising {{the quality of life of}} the population and the availability of natural resources. The Ecological ICMS now assumes an <b>offset</b> <b>dimension,</b> both in the environmental and social aspect, but also to encourage the creation, protection and monitoring of protected areas, including in the faxinais.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present the characterization of faxinal by Theory Sachs Sustainability dimensions (1993) and point out the Ecological ICMS as an alternative that can guarantee the continuity and preservation of this traditional way of community organization. The faxinal is approached and presented according to the five dimensions proposed by the author, who understands the social, economic, ecological, space and cultural, in a composition that allows address the different elements that characterize the faxinalense community...|$|R
40|$|Hull form {{optimization}} from a hydrodynamic performance {{point of}} view is an important aspect of ship design. This paper presents a computational method to estimate the ship resistance (viscous and wave) in calm-water. In the optimization process the evolution strategy (ES) technique is linked to the computational method to obtain an optimum hull form by taking into account the displacement as design constraint. For allowing the large variation of hull form during optimization process the hull surface is represented by NURBS. New hull forms are obtained from the well-known S 60 hull and the classical Wigley hull taken as initial hulls in the optimization process at Fn= 0. 316. The optimization variables are a combination of ship hull <b>offsets</b> and main <b>dimensions.</b> The benchmark results for two test cases indicate that the total resistance of optimized hulls is reduced significantly. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} to use the spectral-domain {{technique}} to perform characteristic analysis of coupled microstrip patch resonators on ferrimagnetic substrates. Our formulation has been validated by comparing our result with the published data and showing an excellent agreement between them. Numerical computations have been performed to obtain dependence of resonant frequency on patch <b>dimensions,</b> <b>offset</b> and separation between the two patches, thicknesses of ferrimagnetic film and substrate. It has been seen that as the length of the patch increases the resonant frequency decreases. The larger the offset between the two patches the lower the resonant frequency. The separation between the two patches strongly affects the resonant frequency. It is also found that the resonant frequency increases as the width of the patch decreases. For the fixed <b>dimensions,</b> separation and <b>offset,</b> a thinner substrate results in a higher resonant frequency, and in contrast, a thinner ferrimagnetic film results in a lower resonant frequency.

40|$|Offsets between {{overlapping}} {{strips of}} laser altimetry data {{serve as the}} input for strip adjustment procedures that estimate and eliminate systematic errors in laser altimetry datasets. For a three-dimensional strip adjustment offsets are to be measured in three <b>dimensions.</b> Height <b>offsets</b> can be determined straightforward by comparing the heights of horizontal planes. Planimetric offsets {{are more difficult to}} determine. This paper shows that the usage of standard least squares matching algorithms on height data as well as on reflectance data may lead to significant biases in the estimation of planimetric offsets. For height data, a model based estimation of linear features is proposed since the number of locations in strip overlaps that are suitable for the estimation of <b>offsets</b> in three <b>dimensions</b> may not be sufficient to estimate all error parameters of a strip adjustment. To improve both the offset estimation and the offset variance estimation using reflectance data an edge response function is introduced. This function takes into account the difference in size of a laser beam's footprint and the distance between successive laser points. 1...|$|R

The chamber is made with the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch free bore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI [...]223 Remington cartridge. Rifles with a [...]223 Wylde chamber will typically accept both [...]223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. Note that while the [...]223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO chambers have slightly different dimension, the cartridges themselves are identical in dimension. [...] The chamber dimension differences are often confused with the cartridge dimensions {{and so it is}} often erroneously thought that the cartridges have different dimensions. The cartridges are loaded to different pressure levels (with the 5.56 being greater), however. [...] (The NATO <b>dimensions</b> <b>offset</b> the higher pressure with a longer throat - often confusing some to think the cartridge itself is longer). This chamber allows the use of both pressure levels safely while also increasing accuracy potential across the range of potential pressures.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{represents}} {{violation of}} someone's subjective right or their legal interests. Damage towards the employer {{can be caused}} by one or many workers. In cases in which the damage is caused by one worker, we have exclusive responsibility {{on the part of the}} worker. In the second case, damage caused by many workers, every worker is responsible for their personal part in causing the damage. To match the caused damage of the employer, the legislature anticipates the damage and assigns the degree of guilt. If the employee during work or related to work, intentionally or by his negligence causes damage to a third person, employer is charged to repay the same the damage and the employee will be charged to repay the employer for the damage he caused. According to the General collective agreement for the private sector in the field of economy, it is regulated that in the employer’s level, harmful activities of the employee are classified and the compensation is defined by the level of the damage that is caused, so as the way and conditions of reduction or forgiveness of the compensation can be determined. There are complex relationships that occur between the employer and employee, in the situations where the employee is harmed or damaged during his work or related to work. First level refers to the employee who suffers the damage at work or related to work. It is employer’s duty to offset the damage according to the general rights of responsible damage <b>offset.</b> Second <b>dimension</b> or second level of the employer’s responsibility to the damage caused to the employee refers to all the actions that the employee can suffer as a result of violating the rights of the work terms. Example, terminated work-relation. If it is proved in the procedure that termination of the work-relation has occurred without the legal cause, the employer’s responsibility is undeniable. Key words: guilt, increased danger, culprit, damaged, damage or harmful activities. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{frequency}} ratio RatioXH associated with two carrier frequencies in ppm is introduced for achieving auto-offsetting and -referencing (AOR) in biomolecular NMR. Once {{the center of}} 1 H is referenced, all the <b>offsets</b> in other <b>dimensions</b> are automatically determined and the centers of the spectral widths provide accurate indirect references. Since the scale in ppm is independent of the magnetic field strength, the AOR does not require manually updating carrier frequencies from time to time, making the multidimensional NMR experiments greatly simplified and reliable. It is extremely valuable when molecules need to be run {{a large number of}} experiments at different times and the data (chemical shifts, for example) need to be compared with each other. In AOR, the error arising from improper referencing of 1 H is handed down in the same amount to the other nuclei being referenced. This error-inheritance provides a measure of accuracy in indirect referencing. The temperature dependence of the {{frequency ratio}} of DSS is derived with the first-order approximation and it can be used for temperature dependent AOR. For nuclei other than 13 C, certain frequency ratios regarding TMS need to be derived (rather than measured) based on the recommended frequency ratios of DSS, thus avoiding conflicts and unifying the two standards...|$|R

Através da especificação de três diferentes Barreiras de Imcumprimento (DB), foi possivel obter diferentes resultados, sublinhando a importância da DB para output do modelo. Durante a crise, o risco de liquidez foi atenuado pelas políticas de cedência de liquidez levadas a cabo pelo BCE. As definições usadas para db 1 e db 2, diferem na forma como são tratados os emprestimos do BCE, permitindo implementar um procedimento assente no cálculo da DD para quantificar a redução no risco dos bancos induzida por estas medidas. Os nossos resultados demonstram que as políticas do BCE reduziram o risco de incumprimento dos bancos que constituem a amostra.

40|$|In {{the burgeoning}} field of Glissant {{scholarship}} {{there has not}} been to date an extended and critical study of two crucial aspects of this multi-faceted author 2 ̆ 7 s output: the philosophical dimension of Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s own work, and his engagement with the work of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. This project focuses on Glissant not only as a writer of fiction, but also as a participant in and commentator upon the discourse of French twentieth century philosophy in the context of his position as a Martinican writer of literature and critical theory. Focusing on the moments in Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s work where he has undertaken a rethinking of the relationship of literature to political change, I explore how Glissant has appropriated, supplemented, and at times departed from Deleuze 2 ̆ 7 s thinking. Chapters focus on Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s points of intersection with some of the lingering problems of French twentieth century philosophy: the figure of difference and the ethical implications of engaging with otherness that are presented in Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s work, Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s conception of literature 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to life, his approach to totality and globalization (the Tout-monde), and his use of the topos of desire in a post-psychoanalytic context. I explain why it is that Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s departures from the trajectories of Deleuze and Guattari 2 ̆ 7 s thinking, and his turn to concepts, problems and topics that are more properly his own, prove to be necessary, given the long-term preoccupations of his literary and theoretical output. Throughout, I ask whether Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s ideas, and particularly those that revolve around the political dimension and the world-changing potential of writing, meet the lofty goals they set for themselves. In this analysis, Glissant proves to be a thinker who intentionally privileges and utilizes tension, ambiguity, and lasting contradiction. Finally, in order to <b>offset</b> the critical <b>dimension</b> of the dissertation, I suggest that Glissant 2 ̆ 7 s work may be read as a source of, or spur to, creation of new perspectives and new ways of thinking with regard to a set of problems haunting the contemporary literary-critical scene. ...|$|R
