5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern {{use of the}} character of Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter either as a tragedy in itself or as an epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2007–08 season, Senators' {{management}} promised change, {{and in the}} off-season fulfilled that promise with changes both in coaching and on-ice personnel. On June 13, 2008, the Senators named Craig Hartsburg, who had been {{head coach of the}} OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, as the new head coach, signing him to a three-year contract. The Senators also named Curtis Hunt, formerly of the Regina Pats, as assistant coach. On the player side, the first change was the buy-out <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> goaltender Ray Emery's contract following a difficult season. Long-time Senator Wade Redden left via free-agency, and 2007–08 trade acquisitions Mike Commodore, Cory Stillman and Martin Lapointe were not re-signed. Brian McGrattan and Andrej Meszaros were traded, Meszaros following a contract dispute. From the free agent market, the Senators signed goaltender Alex Auld, defenceman Jason Smith, and agitating forward Jarkko Ruutu. In exchange for Meszaros, defencemen Filip Kuba, Alexandre Picard and a 2009 first-round draft pick (later dealt for defenceman Chris Campoli) were acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{were three}} {{purpose of this}} study;(1) {{exploring}} successful factors <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting diagnoses in single-chip microprocessor; (2) analyzing the thinking processes of sampling group possessing successful achievement;(3) designing the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits. 16 students of Electrical Engineering were sampled to participate the experiments in three types of diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits. Recording their experimental procedures, thinking aloud procedure and using protocol analysis were three main research methods in this study. The conclusion after data analyzing was as following: The successful factors of the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits consists of professional knowledge, comprehension for circuits, fully taking advantage of strategies, wisely making use of electric meters, judging defining qualities of components, and using sensory assessment. The procedures for diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits are judging symptoms <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting, searching <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting points in circuit, firmly determining trouble shooting points, executing repair activities, accomplishing repairing process. The rank <b>of</b> indicated <b>trouble</b> shooting behaviors were that visual behavior was the most judging activity among all and sensory assessment was the most strategy among all while using electric meter...|$|R

5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

25|$|In {{exchange}} for US $43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto {{was forced to}} sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a bank run that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take-over management <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence. According to American economist Steve Hanke, invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan currency board system, President Bill Clinton and IMF managing director Michel Camdessus deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.|$|E

The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> assets and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. The salary of the CEO was set at $1 per year and the highest salary of employees was restricted to $500,000. Any compensation amount above $500,000 had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold by the employee until the emergency government aid was repaid in full. The U.S. government also gained control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there were poor performance. By December 2009, the U.S. government stake was reduced from a 36% stake to a 27% stake, after Citigroup sold $21 billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in U.S. history, surpassing Bank of America's $19 billion share sale 1 month prior. By December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the U.S. government had made a $12 billion profit on its investment in the company.
