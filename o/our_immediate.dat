There were also displays of astronomical globes, an orrery and pictures of the planets, many taken by contemporary space probes. The Astrocentre also featured the world's first commercial Stellarium, a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> stellar neighbourhood.|$|E
25|$|Stimuli {{that are}} {{directly}} attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central {{point of the}} retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of {{the left and right}} eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.|$|E
500|$|The {{editors of}} the Anti-Jacobin Review took credit for the [...] "dissolution" [...] of the Analytical Review {{in the preface to}} their bound 1798 volume, writing: [...] "The other object of <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> attacks, the Analytical Review, has {{received}} its death-blow, and we have more reason to congratulate ourselves upon the share which we have had in producing its dissolution, than it would be expedient here to unfold." [...] They also published a cartoon by Thomas Rowlandson entitled [...] "A Charm for a Democracy, Reviewed, Analysed, & Destroyed". However, scholars attribute the end of Johnson and Christie's journal to Johnson's trial for seditious libel and the ensuing negative publicity, in addition to the deaths of Christie and Wollstonecraft in 1796 and 1797 respectively.|$|E

"I {{had just}} said to Dick McMullen, 'Be sure not to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> rear I know not, and from what {{direction}} they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance.

2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining {{the fact that our}} perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E

The increased emphasis on <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> neighbourhood was long overdue. Most importantly, I think the one message that has gone out to our own people is that Indian lives, wherever they may be, are of paramount importance. I also like to believe our missions and embassies across the globe are far more accessible to our own people than they were before. We live in a changing world where the challenges are endless. MEA {{is the face of}} this new India {{for the rest of the}} world. We have excellent people fully committed to looking after our interests in every corner of the world. The message to all Indians should be loud and clear – we are always there to look after their interests. The foreign policy has been tweaked to further the interests of India." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Tikkun {{magazine}} Jordi Pigem opined, In {{the last}} ten years, landmark works...have been reflecting and kindling a growing awareness that nature {{is not merely a}} sum of molecules obeying physical and chemical laws, but a living, sensuous, and ensouled matrix in which we fully participate and belong. Tarnas' Cosmos and Psyche extends this rising awareness beyond the bounds of the biosphere. Our psyche is not only deeply connected with <b>our</b> <b>immediate</b> natural environment, but with the whole of the cosmos encompassing us, with the rhythms of the planets we can see above us on clear nights. Searching beneath the depths of the psyche, Tarnas has found the heights of the cosmos. Cosmos and Psyche may radically transform the way we see cultural and political history, individual life journeys, and our sense of participation in the universe. Daniel Pinchbeck, writing in Reality Sandwich, opined that Cosmos was [...] "scrupulously researched and carefully argued", and that it advances [...] "a radical thesis...which seeks to revive astrology as a serious intellectual discipline and provide a cosmological missing link between the human world and the greater universe in which we are embedded." [...] Pinchbeck writes that Cosmos may offer [...] "a transformative matrix for reconceiving our relationship to the cosmos." ...|$|E
