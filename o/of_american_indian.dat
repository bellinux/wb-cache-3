5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E
5|$|Goodman and Edson were {{strongly}} influenced by the use <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> culture by Ernest Thompson Seton in his Woodcraft Indians program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner befitting a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, {{in the eyes of}} their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, Shakur's {{attorneys}} filed papers asking Judge Appleby {{to subpoena}} FBI Director Clarence Kelley, Senator Frank Church {{and other federal}} and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations. Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also {{asked the court to}} require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 89.5 {{percent of}} {{residents}} {{over the age}} of five spoke English at home, according to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey. It was then estimated that 889 people, comprising 18.5 percent of local inhabitants have German ancestrythe largest ethnicity in Omakand 15.3 percent have Irish ancestry. The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 Mexican immigrants, with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents. Conversely, the city has a small Asian population, making up {{less than one percent of}} Omakians. The 2010 census showed that approximately 35 percent of residents lived alone, most of whom were female. Those {{over the age of}} 65 comprised about 16 percent of the population. There have been several efforts to provide service to the homeless people of Omak, although official population figures have not been released.|$|E

5|$|United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff'd, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), {{commonly}} known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, George Hugo Boldt), was a 1974 case heard in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It reaffirmed the reserved right <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional locations that were off the designated reservations.|$|E
25|$|Winters v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{clarifying}} {{water rights}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> reservations.

The case was first argued on October 24, 1907 and a decision was reached January 6, 1908. This case set the standards for the United States government to acknowledge the vitality <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> water rights, and how rights to the water relate to the continuing survival and self-sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> people.|$|E
