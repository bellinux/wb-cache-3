Drought persisted {{in the agricultural}} heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and more than 5,000 banks had failed. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> found themselves homeless, and began congregating in shanty towns – dubbed [...] "Hoovervilles" [...] – that began to appear across the country. In response, President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, to spur new home construction, and reduce foreclosures. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration {{to stimulate the economy}} was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (ERA) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued. Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal.|$|E
