40|$|Aim of this contribution, {{inspired}} by {{the celebration of the}} “ European Day of Languages”, is to reflect on multilingualism, plurilingualism and language education. The main question is why preservation and promotion of cultural diversity are key-aspects for EU policies and why individual plurilingualism has a significant influence on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>European</b> citizenship. Taking into account that the sense of belonging to Europe and the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>European</b> identity is dependent on the ability to interact and communicate with other Europeans using the full range of one’s linguistic repertoire, but also the language of the interlocutor, the contribution explore also the relationship between migration and language education...|$|R

Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
