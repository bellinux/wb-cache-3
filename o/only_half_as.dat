5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

25|$|In a {{two-stroke}} engine {{that uses a}} camshaft, each valve is opened once for every rotation of the crankshaft; in these engines, the camshaft rotates {{at the same speed}} as the crankshaft. In a four-stroke engine, the valves are opened <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> often; thus, two full rotations of the crankshaft occur for each rotation of the camshaft.|$|E
25|$|The Mickleden {{flanks of}} Rossett Pike rise above {{an array of}} green moraines to a tier of crags running below the ridgeline. In {{addition}} to Black Crag there is Rossett Crag, set just beneath the summit. The northern face is less steep, falling <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> far to the upper gathering grounds of the Langstrath.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{age of the}} {{landscape}} has meant that the soils are remarkably infertile and frequently laterised. Even soils derived from granitic bedrock contain {{an order of magnitude}} less available phosphorus and <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much nitrogen as soils in comparable climates in other continents. Soils derived from extensive sandplains or ironstone are even less fertile, nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in zinc, copper, molybdenum and sometimes potassium and calcium.|$|E
25|$|This {{may seem}} counter-intuitive since, at a glance, it is {{apparent}} that the former <b>only</b> makes <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many calls to its logarithmic-time sifting function as the latter; i.e., they seem to differ only by a constant factor, which never affects asymptotic analysis.|$|R

25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0°C is <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> efficient as at 20°C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|E
25|$|The Public Roads Administration {{landed in}} 1992 at a bridge {{alternative}} as their preferred solution, backed among others by the Norwegian Haulier’s Association and Hurum Municipality. The former stated that a bridge {{would result in}} trucks consuming <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much fuel on the segment, while the latter was also enacted {{by the prospect of}} the bridge becoming a tourist attraction. On the other hand, the bridge was met with protests from environmental organizations and residents of Drøbak and the ministry thus decided to go for a tunnel. A full-scale construction was debated, with two tubes and a new highway all the way to Lier.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 1956, Wärtsilä and Sudoimport, the Soviet {{foreign trade}} {{organization}} with a monopoly {{for the foreign}} trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract {{for the construction of}} two polar icebreakers. While <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> powerful as the 44,000hp Lenin, the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time. The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised Wärtsilä to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, Wärtsilä could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, Wärtsilä received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design.|$|E

25|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} {{of an image}} intensifier {{is a measure of}} the output amplitude of dark and light lines on the display for a given level of input from lines presented to the photocathode at different resolutions. It is usually given as a percentage at a given frequency (spacing) of light and dark lines. For example, if you look at white and black lines with a MTF of 99% @ 2 lp/mm then the output of the dark and light lines is going to be 99% as dark or light as looking at a black image or a white image. This value decreases for a given increase in resolution also. On the same tube if the MTF at 16 and 32 lp/mm was 50% and 3% then at 16 lp/mm the signal would be <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> bright/dark as the lines were for 2 lp/mm and at 32 lp/mm the image of the lines would be only three percent as bright/dark as the lines were at 2 lp/mm.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial radiation, for {{the purpose}} of the table above, only {{includes}} sources that remain external to the body. The major radionuclides of concern are potassium, uranium and thorium and their decay products, some of which, like radium and radon are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to radioactive decay since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from uranium-238 is <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much as it originally was because of its 4.5 billion year half-life, and potassium-40 (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is, however, minimal. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half-life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.|$|E
50|$|Revenge from Mars, {{the first}} of the two {{released}} games, sold a promising 6,878 units. However, Star Wars Episode I suffered from a rushed and top-secret production cycle and sold <b>only</b> about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many units (3,525), leading to Williams' decision to close down its historic pinball division.|$|R

In the spring of 2009 an {{automatic}} snorkel system was installed, so the submarine could sail submerged on diesel power, and in August 2009 the submarine sailed out from the Port of Køge submerged.|$|R
500|$|The {{reliability}} of {{the results can be}} improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much [...] to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.|$|E
500|$|North of the Columbia River, {{matters are}} more complicated. First, in southwestern Washington there is <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much {{rotation}} {{as seen in}} rocks of similar age in Oregon. This {{is the basis for}} believing the Crescent terrane has broken from the Siletz terrane (perhaps because they formed on different oceanic plates), and undergone a different rotational history. [...] Second, in Washington there is more variation in the amount of rotation and more faulting, which has led to a speculation that the Crescent terrane has broken up into eight or nine crustal blocks.|$|E
500|$|In {{some respects}} the Hebrides lack {{biodiversity}} {{in comparison to}} mainland Britain; for example, there are <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many mammalian species. However, these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough [...] concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
50|$|McAuliffe's {{changes were}} to {{introduce}} a cork core, with a 2 piece white-tanned leather covering as the standard materials. These changes led to a harder wearing ball, which had better visibility (the white-tanned pigskin was impervious to grass stains and water resistant). The construction materials also meant that the ball was <b>only</b> about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> heavy as Treston's version.|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} the Taurus II did not {{appreciate}} as significantly {{as that of the}} Taurus I; in 2000, Mark Vail noted that the Taurus II was worth <b>only</b> about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> much as its predecessor. In general, the Taurus II is considered to be inferior to the original model because of its different synthesis engine.|$|R
50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear.

500|$|Taking a {{temporary}} divergence, Final FantasyXI used the PlayStation 2's online capabilities as an MMORPG. Initially released for the PlayStation 2 with a PC port arriving six months later, Final FantasyXI was also released on the Xbox 360 {{nearly four years}} after its original release in Japan. This was the first Final Fantasy game to use a free rotating camera. Final FantasyXII was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and uses <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many polygons as Final FantasyX, in exchange for more advanced textures and lighting. It also retains the freely rotating camera from Final FantasyXI. Final FantasyXIII and Final FantasyXIV both make use of Crystal Tools, a middleware engine developed by Square Enix.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{later said}} that without Williams's score the film {{would have been}} <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> successful, and {{according}} to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, {{and went on to}} collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, [...] and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.|$|E
500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected {{around the time of}} delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child. In contrast, the risk falls to 3% if the [...] infection is recurrent, and is 1–3% if the woman is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and is less than 1% if no lesions are visible. Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are <b>only</b> <b>half</b> <b>as</b> likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers. To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.|$|E
50|$|The 68008, {{introduced}} in 1982, {{was designed to}} work with low-cost 8-bit memory systems.
