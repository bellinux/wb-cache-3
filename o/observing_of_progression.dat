40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether long-term protection from light exposure affects the rate <b>of</b> disease <b>progression</b> {{in patients with}} autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD 1), measured using fundus autofluorescence imaging. DESIGN: Longitudinal, retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: Five patients with Stargardt disease protected 1 eye from light exposure by applying a black contact lens during waking hours for >/= 12 months. Disease progression was followed by performing autofluorescence imaging at semi-regular intervals. Longitudinal changes in autofluorescence were studied by evaluating areas of decreased autofluorescence and areas of increased autofluorescence {{as a measure of}} retinal pigment epithelium damage and lipofuscin accumulation, respectively. RESULTS: We <b>observed</b> less <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> decreased autofluorescence in 4 out of 5 light-protected eyes relative to their respective nonprotected eyes.

CONCLUSIONS: Areas of decreased autofluorescence may serve as a useful biomarker for measuring the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> Stargardt disease.

Patients and Methods: We report on 2 patients suffering from metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Both had received previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease, including hepatic artery infusion {[} 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) /folinic acid (FA) and oxaliplatin] and a combination therapy consisting of 5 -FU/FA and gemcitabine. Since a <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> the disease was diagnosed, both patients were started on oral capecitabine at a daily dose of 2, 500 mg/m(2) in 2 divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest.

40|$|Purpose The {{course of}} Dupuytren disease (DD) {{is thought to}} be progressive; however, the course differs for each patient. The {{purpose of this study was}} to study the rate and pattern <b>of</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> DD. Methods We prospectively {{analyzed}} the course of DD at intervals of 3 to 6 months in 247 Dutch participants with primary DD by measuring the surface area of nodules and cords and the total passive extension deficit. The association between surface area and Tubiana stage was tested with generalized estimating equations. Latent class models were used to study different clusters in changes regarding the course of the disease. Results The variance in disease course between participants was large. Regarding the change in surface area (in all fingers) and total passive extension deficit (in the ring and little finger), different clusters were <b>observed.</b> <b>Progression</b> <b>of</b> disease was seen but there were also signs of stability and even regression. Patients with a smaller surface area at baseline were more likely to exhibit regression. Conclusions This study showed that DD is not always progressive and that up to 75 % of patients have a different short-term disease course, such as stability or even regression of disease. This should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of treatment for early-phase DD and in the design of future studies. Furthermore, this information may be useful when counseling patients. (Copyright (C) 2016 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

Several traffic operational problems are routinely being experienced at {{one of the most critical}} elements in the highway system, i. e., grade-separated interchanges. A concern among many practicing engineers is arterial weaving, particularly between the interchange ramp terminal and a closely spaced downstream signalized intersection. High turning volumes and the close spacing between ramp terminals generally associated with interchanges in urbanized areas can create severe operational problems on the cross street. One of the more important factors in determining the level of service of a signalized intersection is the quality <b>of</b> <b>progression</b> along the arterial. The quality <b>of</b> <b>progression</b> is expressed by a progression factor (PF). Simulations were conducted using TRAF-NETSIM to <b>observe</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>progression</b> on the ramp capacity which showed that the ramp capacity was affected by the quality <b>of</b> <b>progression.</b> The study section consisted of an arterial having an off-ramp on the upstream and a downstream intersection at a distance of 600 feet. There was no signal at the downstream intersection. The ramp traffic, having yield control, made a right turn on to the arterial and then made a left turn at the downstream intersection. All the arterial through traffic was made to go through the downstream intersection without making any turns. Both the default TRAF-NETSIM and Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) recommended decile gap distributions were analyzed. The effect of random flow along the arterial on ramp capacity was studied and a negative exponential regression model was developed to compute ramp capacity for one, two and three lane arterials. Though the trends were found to be similar, due to lower (better) gap acceptance criteria of the HCM recommended decile gap distribution, the ramp capacity while using this distribution was better. The effect of progressed flow on ramp capacity was then studied. It was observed that the variation in ramp capacity for different PF increased with an increase in volume to capacity ratios. Adjustment factors were developed to determine the ramp capacity for different PF given the ramp capacity for random flow...|$|R

40|$|We {{recognize}} that increased systolic pressure {{is the most}} challenging form of hypertension today and that pulse pressure as an independent cardiovascular risk factor has focused attention on arterial stiffness and wave reflections {{as the most important}} factors determining these pressures. In recent years, many studies emphasized the role of arterial rigidity in the development of cardiovascular diseases, and it was shown that stiffening of arteries is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Moreover, arterial stiffening is linked to decreased glomerular filtration rate, and is predictive <b>of</b> kidney disease <b>progression</b> and the patient's cardiovascular outcome. Premature vascular aging and arterial stiffening are <b>observed</b> with <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This accelerated aging is associated with outward remodeling of large vessels, characterized by increased arterial radius not totally compensated for by artery wall hypertrophy. Arterial stiffening in CKD and ESRD patients is of multifactorial origin with extensive arterial calcifications representing a major covariate. With aging, the rigidity is more pronounced in the aorta than in peripheral conduit arteries, leading to the disappearance or inversion of the arterial stiffness gradient and less protection of the microcirculation from high-pressure transmission.
