5|$|The {{court was}} unwilling to extend the {{traditional}} defence of qualified privilege as it was {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> candidate for the election is not.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|After the {{planning}} approval was granted, local residents hired barristers to consider an appeal against the decision. The activation of {{the planning}} permission allowed solicitors <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group called Residents United Residents Association (RURA) to launch its Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, which challenged the council's decision making process. One of the original areas for appeal revolved around historic covenants on parts of the land, but the Charities Commission ruled that the fields are not charitable land.|$|E

5|$|As King of the Isles, Lǫgmaðr faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} factions supporting his younger brothers, Haraldr and Óláfr. At some point, the Islesmen {{are reported to}} have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster to select a temporary ruler in the region. This act may have been initiated <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> faction supporting Óláfr. Whatever the case, Ua Briain responded by placing an Uí Briain relative upon the throne. The Uí Briain interlopers, however, {{do not appear to}} have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Negron is the {{defendant}} {{in a court}} proceeding, facing {{a life sentence for}} his killing of Rodolfo. He is successfully defended by a powerful executive attorney acting <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unknown wealthy man. Hector is brought to the Bahamas and is reunited with the Head of the Primavera, accompanied by its new owner who takes out a rosary and reveals himself as an adult Angelo. They both hold Hector's rosary and happily burst into tears.|$|E

He served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762. By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,201 Africans to slavery in the Americas.|$|E

They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement it incurred <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former employee injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1822, St George's Chapel served Taunton's growing Catholic {{community}} for over 35 years, before {{they moved to}} a larger church which was completed in 1860. After being rented out for a time, when it was known as St George's Hall, the building was then sold in 1878 to a company acting <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of Freemasons, who purchased it to provide {{a home for the}} Unanimity & Sincerity Lodge.

5|$|Toxicology testing, {{also known}} as safety testing, is {{conducted}} by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{and eight}} others were tried at York Assizes on 16 March 1820, charged with sedition. After a two-week trial, five {{defendants}} were found guilty. Hunt {{was sentenced to}} 30months in Ilchester Gaol; Bamford, Johnson, and Healey were given one year each, and Knight was jailed for two years on a subsequent charge. A civil case <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weaver wounded at Peterloo was brought against {{four members of the}} Manchester Yeomanry, Captain Birley, Captain Withington, Trumpeter Meagher, and Private Oliver, at Lancaster Assizes, on 4 April 1822. All were acquitted, as the court ruled their actions had been justified to disperse an illegal gathering.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{along with}} his brother, William, and a mutual friend from law school, he became a {{founding}} partner of the Cincinnati law firm Keating, Muething & Keating. Beginning in the late 1950s they took on Carl Lindner, Jr. as a client. Lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores, supermarkets, real estate, and savings and loans, and soon essentially became Keating's sole client. In 1956, he filed requests for Q clearances <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small company of former Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists with an office in Newtown, Ohio; unknown to Keating, the FBI suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him, but no charges were made. Keating {{was admitted to the}} U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1958.|$|E

Proselytizing <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual for any religion other than Islam can result in <b>a</b> sentence <b>of</b> up to 5 years.

5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
