5|$|Slovenia– September 2011– Following {{the failure}} of June referendums <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> to combat the {{economic}} crisis and the departure of coalition partners, the Borut Pahor government lost a motion of confidence and December 2011 early elections were set, following which Janez Janša became PM. After a year of rigorous saving measures, and also due to continuous opening of ideological question, the centre-right government of Janez Janša was ousted on 27 February 2013 by nomination of Alenka Bratušek as the PM-designated of a new centre-left coalition government.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> {{to prevent future}} abuse of {{psychiatry}} was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} {{issued a}} threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On the following day, the Senate of the Republic of Poland {{called for the}} establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius. Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> to avoid such incidents in the future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E

However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function.

40|$|Inconsistency and incoherency are two {{sorts of}} {{erroneous}} {{information in a}} DL ontology which have been widely discussed in ontology-based applications. For example, they {{have been used to}} detect modeling errors during ontology construction. To provide more informative metrics which can tell the differences between inconsistent ontologies and between incoherent terminologies, there has been some work <b>on</b> <b>measuring</b> inconsistency of an ontology and <b>on</b> <b>measuring</b> incoherency of a terminology. However, most of them merely focus either <b>on</b> <b>measuring</b> inconsistency or <b>on</b> <b>measuring</b> incoherency and no clear ideas of how to extend them to allow for the other. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measure DL ontologies, named distance-based measures. It has the merits that both inconsistency and incoherency can be measured in a unified framework. Moreover, only classical DL interpretations are used such that there is no restriction on the DL languages used...|$|R

25|$|An {{understanding}} of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their {{role in shaping the}} individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> of executive functioning.|$|E

Children of untreated alcoholics score lower <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> of family cohesion, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, and independence. They {{have higher levels of}} conflict within the family, and many experience other family members as distant and non-communicative. In families with untreated alcoholics, the cumulative effect of the family dysfunction may affect the children's ability to grow in developmentally healthy ways.|$|E
