50|$|Much {{discussion}} has involved {{whether or not}} ivy climbing trees will harm them. In Europe, the harm is generally minor although there can be competition for soil nutrients, light, and water, and senescent trees supporting heavy ivy growth can be liable to windthrow damage. Harm and problems are more significant in North America, where ivy is without the natural pests and diseases that control its vigour in its native continents; the photosynthesis or structural strength of a tree can be overwhelmed by aggressive ivy growth leading to death directly or by <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> and insect attacks caused by weakness from the duress.|$|E
5000|$|When {{grown on}} medium {{containing}} hydrolysed tomato residue, this fungus utilizes glucose to synthesize triacylglycerols (TAG) rich in GLA. This fungus {{has been investigated}} {{for use in the}} production of single cell oils (SCO) and storage lipids (like GLA). C. echinulata is also able to selectively take up and sequester metal contaminants from polluted waters, suggesting a potential use in bioremediation of polluted water. However, its role as an agent of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> may limit its use in environmental remediation.Cunninghamella echinulata is able to grow on orange rind and assimilate carbohydrates into necessary biomolecules, where the fermented peel does not exhibit appreciable discolouration or odour. Growth of this fungus on organic nitrogen leads yields lipids rich in Î³-linolenic acid (GLA). The presence of an active monooxygenase system allows this species to perform oxidative demethylation and hydroxylation. The fungus possesses a p450 cytochrome system similar to that in humans, making it a potentially useful model for the study liver-mediated drug metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Although {{frequently}} encountered as a contaminant {{in clinical}} specimens, P. variotii is an uncommon causative agent {{of human and}} animal infections, but {{is considered to be}} an emerging agent of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease,</b> particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It has been suggested that the extremotolerant nature of the fungus contributes to the its pathogenic potential. Pneumonia due to P. variotii has been reported, albeit rarely, in the medical literature. Most cases are known from diabetics or individuals subject to long-term corticosteroid treatment for other diseases. Paecilomyces variotii has also been reported as a causative agent of sinusitis, endophthalmitis, wound infection following tissue transplant, cutaneous hyalohyphomycosis, onychomycosis, osteomyelitis, otitis media and dialysis-related peritonitis. It has also been reported from mastitis in a goat, and as an agent of mycotic infections of dogs and horses. Besides clinical samples, the fungus is a common contaminant of moisture-damaged materials in the indoor environment including carpet, plaster and wood. It is commonly found in indoor air samples and may contribute to indoor allergy. This species produces the mycotoxin, viriditoxin.|$|E

40|$|The intense {{degradation}} of defense cells {{caused by the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an organism and {{the speed at which}} the viral genome mutates to escape the initial immune response are the prime difficulties in combating <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases</b> and in creating an efficient vaccine for this virus. The common <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases</b> observed for HIV positive patients include tuberculosis, candidiasis and toxoplasmosis. One of the risk factors is the decrease in CD 4 + T-lymphocyte count and the high plasmatic viral load, rendering the organism susceptible to these pathogens. Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, this does not provide total elimination of the virus, only eliminating the virus present in the plasma. On treatment withdrawal, the infected latent CD 4 + T-cells can re-establish the infection, conferring a large barrier to definitive HIV cure. Current studies have evaluated the inhibition of class I histone diacetylase (HDAC) enzymes as a strategy to induce the viral gene expression and, consequently, the gradual emptying of latent reservoirs of the virus, improving the action of antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the monitoring of immune activation and counting of CD 4 + T-lymphocytes are of fundamental importance to the prognosis of HIV patients, along with early diagnoses of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases,</b> in order to avoid complications from these diseases...|$|R
5000|$|Opportunistic {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} an infectious disease {{in a host}} with depressed resistance (immunodeficiency) or if they have unusual access {{to the inside of}} the body (for example, via trauma). Opportunistic infection may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host, such as pathogenic bacteria or fungi in the gastrointestinal or the upper respiratory tract, and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in Clostridium difficile colitis) or from the environment as a result of traumatic introduction (as in surgical wound infections or compound fractures). An <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of genetic defects (such as Chronic granulomatous disease), exposure to antimicrobial drugs or immunosuppressive chemicals (as might occur following poisoning or cancer chemotherapy), exposure to ionizing radiation, or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with measles, malaria or HIV disease). Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host.|$|E
5000|$|Although P. obovatum is {{primarily}} {{thought to be}} saprotrophic, it can cause infections in human hosts under certain circumstances, and more rarely, of other animals notably dogs. The capacity of Phialemonium obovatum to grow at and above human body temperature is a key pathogenicity factor of this species that distinguishes it from many other dematiaceous molds. This species has been reported as a causative agent of endocarditis, keratitis, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, subcutaneous infections, and infections arising secondary to burns. In case studies involving infections following severe burns, the hyphae of P. obovatum {{have the ability to}} invade into blood vessels and tissues. Infections caused by this species are largely opportunistic and restricted to immunocompromised individuals with few cases reported from individuals with normally functional immune systems. It has a proclivity to invade central nervous system tissues. Given the rising population burden of immunocompromised people due to improved management of immunological diseases or mediate by therapeutic side effects, this and other agents of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> are sometimes considered to be [...] "emerging" [...] agents of disease. Accordingly, P. obovatum and other dematiaceous fungi have been increasingly reported in allogenic transplant recipients possibly as a consequence of chemotherapeutic immune suppression primarily intended to reduce tissue rejection.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) {{guidelines}} {{are intended for}} all clinicians involved {{in the care of}} HIV-positive persons, and are available in print, online, and as a free App for download for iPhone and Android. GUIDELINE HIGHLIGHTS The 2015 version of the EACS guidelines contains major revisions in all sections; antiretroviral treatment (ART), comorbidities, coinfections and <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Among the key revisions is the recommendation of ART for all HIV-positive persons, irrespectively of CD 4 count, based on the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study results. The recommendations for the preferred and the alternative ART options have also been revised, and a new section on the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been added. A number of new antiretroviral drugs/drug combinations {{have been added to the}} updated tables on drug-drug interactions, adverse drug effects, dose adjustment for renal/liver insufficiency and for ART administration in persons with swallowing difficulties. The revisions of the coinfection section reflect the major advances in anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with direct-acting antivirals with earlier start of treatment in individuals at increased risk of liver disease progression, and a phasing out of interferon-containing treatment regimens. The section on <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases</b> has been restructured according to individual pathogens/diseases and a new overview table has been added on CD 4 count thresholds for different primary prophylaxes. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis and management of HIV infection and related coinfections, <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases</b> and comorbidities continue to require a multidisciplinary effort for which the 2015 version of the EACS guidelines provides an easily accessable and updated overview...|$|R

INTERVENTION: Episodic or continuous antiretroviral therapy initially, followed by continuous therapy in participants previously assigned to episodic treatment. MEASUREMENTS: <b>Opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> or death was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Eighteen months after the recommendation to reinitiate continuous therapy, mean CD 4 + cell counts were 0. 152 x 10 (9) cells/L (95 % CI, 0. 136 to 0. 167 x 10 (9) cells/L) less in participants previously assigned to episodic treatment (P < 0. 001). The proportion of follow-up time spent with CD 4 + cell counts of 0. 500 x 10 (9) cells/L or more and HIV RNA levels of 400 copies/mL or less was 29 % for participants initially assigned to episodic therapy and 66 % for those assigned to continuous therapy. Participants who reinitiated continuous therapy experienced rapid suppression of HIV RNA levels (89. 7 % with HIV RNA levels < or = 400 copies/mL after 6 months), but CD 4 + cell counts after 6 months remained 0. 140 x 10 (9) cells/L below baseline. The hazard ratio (episodic versus continuous treatment) for <b>opportunistic</b> <b>disease</b> or death decreased after the recommendation to reinitiate continuous therapy (from 2. 5 [CI, 1. 8 to 3. 5] to 1. 4 [CI, 1. 0 to 2. 0]; P = 0. 033 for difference). The residual excess risk was attributable to failure to reinitiate therapy by some participants and slow recovery of CD 4 + cell counts for those who reinitiated therapy.

40|$|Parasite infections often {{induce a}} {{reduction}} in host immune response either because of a direct manipulation {{of the immune system}} by the parasite or because of energy depletion. Although infection-induced immunodepression can favour the establishment of the parasite within the host, a too severe immunodepression may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens, stopping the period over which the parasite can be transmitted to other hosts. Here, we explore how the risk of contracting <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases</b> affects the survival of the amphipod Gammarus pulex infected by the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis. Previous work with this system has shown that upon infection, G. pulex has a substantially reduced immune response. Non-infected and P. laevis-infected hosts were maintained either in control or in micro-organism-enriched water, so as to vary the risk of encountering opportunistic pathogens. As predicted, we found that host mortality was exacerbated when infected gammarids were maintained in micro-organism-enriched water compared with clean, control water; whereas for non-infected gammarids, living in micro-organism-enriched water only moderately increased the risk of mortality. These results show that the virulence of parasites that reduce the host immune response is an environmentally sensitive trait that depends on the concomitant risk for the host of contracting <b>opportunistic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This extra source of host mortality probably represents a cost for P. laevis, and we tentatively predict that the optimal level of parasite exploitation should depend on environmental conditions...|$|R
