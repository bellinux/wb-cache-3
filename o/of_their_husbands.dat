5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom. Although women could not lead military forces, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked on the land as part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of World War I, Macmillan spoke for the peace-seeking women of the United Kingdom at the International Congress of Women, a peace {{congress}} convened at The Hague. Afterward, she met with world leaders such as President Woodrow Wilson, whose countries were still neutral, to present the proposals formulated at The Hague. Wilson subsequently used these proposals as some of his Fourteen Points, his justification for making war to forge a lasting peace. At war's end, Macmillan served as a delegate at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, and helped encourage the founding of the League of Nations. Macmillan tried but did not succeed in getting the League to establish nationality for women independent of the nationality <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b>|$|E
5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E

Thematic analysis revealed that wives of men who have sex with men were at risk for HIV from their husbands’ sexual practices, which are often hidden to avoid the potential consequences of stigmatisation, as well as from gender-based inequities that make husbands the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use, even when wives are aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband’s</b> same-sex behaviour. Innovative interventions are needed to address HIV-related risk in couples where wives remain unaware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband’s</b> same-sex behaviour, and for wives who are aware but remain within these marriages...|$|R

The laws regarding a divorce were the same {{for both men and}} women.

25|$|Teej is a {{significant}} festival for Hindu women, particularly in northern and western states of India. Parvati is the primary deity of the festival, and it ritually celebrates married life and family ties. It also celebrates the monsoon. The festival is marked with swings hung from trees, girls playing on these swings typically in green dress (seasonal color of crop planting season), while singing regional songs. Historically, unmarried maidens prayed to Parvati for a good mate, while married women prayed for the well-being <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> and visited their relatives.

Finally, in 1922, the United States Congress passed the Married Women's Act, granting married women their own nationality in the United States.
