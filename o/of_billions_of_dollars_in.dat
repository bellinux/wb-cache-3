5|$|In December 1978, Metro {{announced}} that the new completion date of the Green Line past the Anacostia Station to Rosecroft Raceway would be 1987 (a year later than anticipated). Metro also {{announced that}} cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at all unbuilt Green Line stations. By July 1979, despite the release <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed back {{the construction of the}} Anacostia Station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue Line to late 1986. But construction schedules continued to slip: despite reaffirming its construction schedules in December 1979, Metro announced in January 1980 that completion of the Green Line terminus in Prince George's County would be pushed back six more months to 1987.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just {{before the end of}} World War II. In the war's aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading {{to the creation of the}} United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> loans to rebuild Europe. Look magazine named him the second most fascinating person in the country behind Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E

50|$|Martin J. Sullivan became CEO of {{the company}} in 2005. He began his career at AIG as a clerk in its London office in 1970. AIG then took on tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> risk {{associated}} with mortgages. It insured tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> derivatives against default, but did not purchase reinsurance to hedge that risk. Secondly, it used collateral on deposit to buy mortgage-backed securities. When losses hit the mortgage market in 2007-2008, AIG had to pay out insurance claims and also replace the losses in its collateral accounts.|$|R
25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, {{which could not}} be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> assets.|$|E
25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on {{liquified natural gas}} and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing. The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand. Converting to a nuclear-free gas and oil energy economy would cost tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> annual fees. One estimate is that even including the disaster, more lives would have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.|$|E

He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars)</b> <b>in</b> a country that sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E

25|$|The NDP {{voted against}} the {{government}} in all four confidence votes in the 39th parliament, the only party to do so. These were votes on the United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute, extending the mission to Afghanistan, the 2006 Canadian federal budget and 2007 federal budget. However, it worked with the Conservatives on other issues. After forcing the Conservatives to agree to certain revisions, the NDP helped pass the Accountability Act. After the NDP fiercely criticized the initial Conservative attempt at a Clean Air Act, the Conservatives agreed {{to work with the}} NDP and other parties to revise the legislation. The NDP also supported the government in introducing regulations on income trusts, fearing that trends toward mass trust conversions by large corporations to avoid Canadian income taxes would cause the loss <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> budget revenue to support health care, pensions and other federal programs. At the same time, the NDP was also wary of the threat of investor losses from income trusts' exaggerated performance expectations.|$|E
25|$|If global {{oil prices}} remain high, {{it is likely}} that Canada will become one of the largest oil {{producers}} in the world in the next few decades. If so, there will be environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products. The oil sands deposits are roughly the size of Florida and the operations would drastically alter the landscape, which until recently was largely wilderness. In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use {{a large portion of the}} flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels. However, given the hundreds <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> revenue expected to be generated by the oil sands in the next few decades, {{it is likely that}} future projects will be approved regardless of the problems.|$|E
25|$|In December 1978, Metro {{announced}} that cost considerations had forced it {{to abandon the}} high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at the Anacostia station. In late 1978 and 1979, a controversy erupted over parking at the planned station. In 1978, Metro proposed building a 2,000-space parking lot {{on the west side}} of the Anacostia Freeway. Angry residents, protesting the amount of traffic which would come into their residential neighborhood, forced Metro to reduce the size of the parking lot to 1,300 spaces. In January 1979, Metro proposed building a 500-space parking garage at the proposed Anacostia station, and adding another 800 temporary spaces by paving over a part of Anacostia Park (to be removed once additional parking was built at the terminus of the Green Line at Rosecroft). But residents resisted this plan as well on the grounds that too much traffic would clog local streets. (These concerns were resolved in March 1980.) By July 1979, despite the release <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed the construction of the Anacostia station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue Line to late 1986. But construction deadlines continued to slip. Despite reaffirming its Branch Avenue Line construction deadlines in December 1979, in January 1980 Metro {{announced that}} completion of the Green Line terminus would be pushed back six more months to 1987. In January 1981, Metro admitted that the station would not open until 1990 because of funding constraints.|$|E

2500|$|The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) {{spoke out}} in {{opposition}} to the possibility of permanent residence for FDHs, citing its potential high costs.

Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions legislator Pan Pey-chyou also expressed concern that increasing the labour supply by giving FDHs the freedom to pursue other employment could put other workers at a disadvantage. Lee's fellow DAB legislator Chan Kam-lam stated that the party had collected 91,500 signatures in 18 electoral districts, of whom all but 210 were {{in opposition to}} granting FDHs the right of abode. In response, Law Yuk-kai of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor expressed doubts about the DAB's expenditures figures, deriding them as [...] "scare tactics" [...] and comparing them to the DAB's earlier opposition to residence rights for mainland children in Ng Ka Ling v.
