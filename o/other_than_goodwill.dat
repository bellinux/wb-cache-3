40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of Australian {{equivalents}} to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the accounts and accounting quality of 1, 065 listed firms, relying on retrospective reconciliations between Australian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP) and IFRS. We find that IFRS increases total liabilities, decreases equity and more firms have earnings decreases than increases. IFRS earnings and equity are not more value relevant than AGAAP earnings and equity and while adjustments for changes in accounting for provisions and intangibles <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>goodwill</b> are value relevant, they weaken associations with market value. Goodwill adjustments improve associations with market value. We also find that the reconciliation note for the earnings adjustments contained no new information.

40|$|The {{purchase}} price allocation process introduced by IFRS 3 provides {{a unique and}} new setting to study the reliability and value relevance of acquired intangible assets and goodwill. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the {{purchase price}} allocation and to analyze whether the separate recognition of acquired net assets adds the quality of financial reporting. This study focuses on the value relevance of acquired intangible assets and on the possible bias, stemming from managerial discretion, in their valuation. This study is conducted with European data. The sample consists of business combinations which were completed between 1. 1. 2005 and 31. 12. 2007 and were reported under IFRS 3. The data concerning purchase price allocation is hand collected from the financial statements of the sample companies. Additionally, supplementary financial data is extracted from other sources. Multiple regression models are used as the primary research method in this study. According to the results, reporting of purchase price allocation adds the quality of financial information. The study provides evidence that intangible assets (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>goodwill)</b> measured in fair values are value relevant. The results regarding the value relevance of goodwill are mixed. However, more support is found that goodwill contains no value relevant information to investors. Evidence is also found that there could be significant differences in the extent of bias in intangible asset (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>goodwill)</b> valuation of firms with different level of incentives to allocate the purchase price strategically. Regarding goodwill some tentative results indicate that the allocation of goodwill to operating segments for impairment testing purposes might be done strategically because more profitable operating segments seem to receive more goodwill allocation. Markets seem, however, to take the risk of strategic purchase price allocation into account and based on the results the acquired intangible assets and goodwill are valued at discount for riskier firms...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} and obtains {{empirical}} evidence about value relevance of intangible assets, the correlations between value relevance and value reliability of intangible assets, {{and the influence of}} IFRS-based application of PSAK by using Ohlson price model. The dependent variable in this research is value relevance (Ht). The independent variable of this research are intangible assets (ATB), goodwill (GW), identifiable intangible assets <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>goodwill</b> (ATBSG), and value reliability (TAB-TL). The control variables used are earnings per share (EPS) and book value of equity (BVS). This research using an eight-year long range of time, with 2007 - 2009 as the period pre-IFRS-based application of PSAK, 2010 and 2011 as the cut-off period, and 2012 - 2014 as the period of post-IFRS-based application of PSAK. This research uses purposive sampling as the sampling method. 38 companies which are listed on Indonesian Stock Exchange were chosen because they meet the criteria. Hypothesis testing using multiple regression analysis, chow test, and independent samples t-test. The result of this research shows that intangible assets and its components have value relevance, but value relevance does not increase after implementation of PSAK-based IFRS. The next results shows that more reliable companies in the reporting of intangible assets and its components, the value relevance will increase, the results are still consistent after the adoption of PSAK-based IFRS...|$|E

40|$|With little current public {{information}} on intangible asset capitalisation in the New Zealand environment, this study uses companies {{listed on the}} New Zealand Stock Exchange to determine current practice. The {{purpose of the study}} is to provide a springboard for further research into the intangible area as well as providing an understanding of how New Zealand companies contend with intangible assets, {{in the light of the}} controversy that has surrounded the introduction of the exposure draft, ED- 87 Accounting for Intangible Assets. The study finds that, apart from goodwill, there are a variety of other intangible assets capitalised by New Zealand listed companies and that the majority of these assets are valued at cost. Capitalisation extends across most industry sectors and company size, although a higher proportion of larger than smaller companies capitalise intangible assets. The contribution to asset value made by capitalisation is quite high for some companies, with intangible assets <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>goodwill</b> contributing a greater proportion to asset value than goodwill. Although capitalising intangibles reduces the discrepancy between market and book values of equity, capitalising companies still have higher market-to-book ratios than non-capitalising companies, indicating that the market recognises further uncapitalised intangible value. Whilst companies with higher debt levels have a greater tendency to be capitalising companies, there is no evidence to suggest that companies are capitalising simply because of leverage factors. However, with amortisation periods tending to longer rather than shorter time spans (with many companies not amortising at all), companies may well be using amortisation practices to maintain higher asset levels on the balance sheet. The research supports overseas evidence for the value relevance of capitalised intangible assets and also finds that corporate ownership diversity and size can be influential in that value relevance...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{research}} problem: The area of accounting choice has been frequently studied on listed firms, however {{little attention has}} been directed towards unlisted firms. Hence, it is unclear how the results from previous studies apply to unlisted firms. In addition, the transition to the new K 3 framework implies effects on the goodwill asset in Swedish unlisted firms since the longest allowed amortization period is being reduced from 20 to 10 years. Purpose: The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to address the determinants behind the accounting choice regarding goodwill in unlisted Swedish firms prior to the transition to the K 3 framework. In order to enhance the understanding and the interpretation of the primary purpose, a complementary purpose is included, which consists of studying how banks view the goodwill accounting regulation in RR 1 : 00 compared to K 3 in their credit assessment. Method: A quantitative study is carried out, using data from consolidated financial statements of Swedish unlisted firms for the fiscal year of 2013. The quantitative approach is complemented with a qualitative approach, consisting of three interviews with respondents from three Swedish banks. Empirical findings: The results from this study indicate that accounting choice in unlisted firms is affected by specific determinants and that these determinants differ between listed and unlisted firms. Financial leverage does not have a statistically significant impact on the amortization period for goodwill among Swedish unlisted firms. However, firm size is shown to have a significant impact on the amortization period for goodwill. Moreover, the study finds significant results of firms in high-tech industries applying shorter amortization periods for goodwill, which is the opposite of what was expected. The findings from the quantitative approach are further supported and interpreted by insights gained from the qualitative approach. Suggestions for further research: Since accounting choice in unlisted firms is a fairly unexplored research area, one suggestion for further research is to study the accounting choice of unlisted firms within <b>other</b> areas <b>than</b> <b>goodwill</b> accounting. Another suggestion is to further study the impact of industries on accounting choice. At last, it would be interesting to study if the transition to K 3 will lead to an increased voluntary adoption of IFRS and if so, what the incentives for this might be...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of intangible assets as important value drlvers and critrcal success factors {{has increased in}} the customer centric world of today. Despite the {{importance of}} the intangible assets, intangible assets <b>other</b> <b>than</b> purchased <b>goodwill</b> are generally not recognised in the financial statements. Thls has resulted in declining relevance and declsion usefulness of corporate annual reports to the users of annual reports There have been suggestions for disclosure of intangrbie assets m the annual reports These suggestions have argued for expermentation wlth development of measurement technology for measuring and reporting intanglble assets in the annual reports. Thls research identifies customer satisfaction as a signal of the intangible assets to explore the possibility of disclosure of lntanglble assets like customer satlsfaction in the annual reports. Ths thesis is a behavioural exploratory study that adopts a user orientation approach to answer two research queshons of why and how customer satisfaction should be disclosed in the annual reports The theoretical framework developed to explore the main research questions argues that in vrew of the relevance of disclosure of customer sabsfaction to the users of the annual reports, positive and negative, 2 ̆ 7 internally 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 externally generated 2 ̆ 7 measures of customer satisfaction may be disclosed qualitatively or quantitatively in the Operating and Financial Revlew of the annual reports. Research hypotheses are suggested for assessmg the relevance of the customer satisfaction dlsclosure to the users of annual reports and for assessing the reaction of the users of annual reports to different types of customer satrsfactron disclosures Using a triangulation research approach, the research uses qualitative and quantitative research methods in explonng the research hypotheses. A number of economic financial reporhng and psychological theories for example Fuzzy Trace Theory, Attribute Framing Effects and Affective Reaction Model are used to explain the findings of the research study The research concludes that even though there are existing rneasure nentt echnologies {{that can be used to}} report customer satisfaction in the annual reports but the reluctance of the preparers of annual reports to report anything negative or qualitative in the annual reports is the main obstacle in reporting relevant information about customer satisfaction in the annual reports The research suggests policy recommendations for reporting customer satisfaction in the annual reports and outlines future areas of research...|$|R
