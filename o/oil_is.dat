5|$|Tucumã {{butter is}} {{extracted}} {{from both the}} pulp and seed of the fruit of Astrocaryum vulgare, a South American oil palm. The pulp <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> used as a skin conditioner. The seed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> sold {{for use as a}} cooking oil and for making soap due to its high lauric acid content.|$|E
30|$|The {{maturity}} data in Table  1 {{show that the}} Nembe Creek <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> slightly more mature relative to the Kolo Creek oils; ratios indicate that the source kitchen had just gone beyond the oil window {{at the time of}} generation, while the Kolo Creek <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> generated when the source kitchen was just about to enter the oil window. It invariably implies that the Kolo Creek <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> generated and expelled before the Nembe Creek <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> generated.|$|R
50|$|To {{allergic}} {{or otherwise}} sensitive people, synthetic fragrance <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> often less desirable than plant-derived essential oils as components of perfume. However, synthetic {{versions of the}} same compound as a natural essential <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> usually very comparable. Furthermore, natural <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> in many cases significantly more expensive than their synthetic equivalents.|$|R
5|$|Drying <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> {{vegetable}} <b>oils</b> that dry to a hard {{finish at}} normal room temperature. Such <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> {{used as the}} basis of oil paints, and in other paint and wood finishing applications. In addition to the oils listed here, walnut, sunflower and safflower <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> also considered to <b>be</b> drying <b>oils.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because this {{blend of}} crude <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> heavy and highly acidic, it fetches lower prices than {{benchmark}} crudes such as Brent or Minas.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrant seed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> an {{ingredient}} in cosmetics preparations, often {{in combination with}} vitamin E. The leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrant seed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> rich in vitamin E and {{unsaturated}} fatty acids, including {{alpha-linolenic acid}} and gamma-linolenic acid.|$|E
50|$|Edible <b>oil</b> can <b>be</b> {{extracted}} from the mesocarp and kernel of A. maripa. Oleic acid is the predominant fatty acid in oil {{extracted from}} the mesocarp, while lauric acid predominates in the kernel. About half of the fatty acids in the mesocarp <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> saturated and half unsaturated. The tocopherol content of the mesocarp <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> average (in comparison to other edible oils) while the kernel <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> low in tocopherols.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> used for biofuel (biodiesel and Straight Vegetable Oil) in {{addition}} to having other uses. Other <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> used only as biofuel.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deal with}} methods that provide quality of grape seed oil. The grape seed <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> placed at {{different}} temperatures for the specified period of time. The quality of grape seed <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> compared with cold-pressed sunflower oil and cold-pressed olive oil. The quality {{and stability of}} <b>oils</b> <b>was</b> assessed by using sensory analysis, spectrophoto-metric color measurement, acid value and determination of fatty acids by gas chromato-graphy. The {{results indicate that the}} stability of vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>was</b> influenced by storage at 22 °C and light. The acid number and the content of fatty acids did not greatly chan-ge during storage. The results of sensory evaluation and spectrophotometric color mea-surement detected some changes during storage. Grape seed <b>oil</b> 2014 <b>was</b> the least sta-ble and sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the most stable...|$|R

5|$|Croton oil (tiglium <b>oil)</b> <b>is</b> pressed {{from the}} seeds of Croton tiglium. Highly toxic, it was {{formerly}} used as a drastic purgative.|$|E
5|$|Honesty oil, {{from the}} seeds of Lunaria annua, which contain 30–40% oil. The <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} rich in long chain fatty acids, including erucic and nervonic acid, making it suitable for certain industrial purposes.|$|E
50|$|Most {{citrus peel}} <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed}} mechanically or cold-pressed (similar to olive oil extraction). Due {{to the relatively}} large quantities of oil in citrus peel and low cost to grow and harvest the raw materials, citrus-fruit <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> obtained as byproducts of the citrus industry.|$|R
50|$|However, {{out of ten}} planned plants {{only four}} became operational. The {{technology}} was primitive carbonization and <b>oil</b> yield <b>was</b> low. Mined <b>oil</b> shale <b>was</b> heaped into mounds which were ignited after covering by peat. Distilled shale oil and <b>oil</b> shale gas <b>were</b> collected through 300 mm perforated pipes. <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> separated from gas by electric filters. Until {{the end of the}} war, only 1,500 tonnes of shale <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> produced.|$|R
40|$|The direct {{toxicity}} of some essential, mineral and plant oils to {{the eggs and}} females of the predacious mite Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) was tested in the laboratory. Sweet basil <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the most toxic essential oil to females N. cucumeris, while sweet marjoram <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the least toxic one (LC 50 = 2. 315 and 7. 021 %, respectively). In contrast, rosemary <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> toxic to eggs of N. cucumeris, while sweet basil <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the least effective oil against predator eggs (LC 50 = 2. 695 and 11. 950 %, respectively). The mineral <b>oil</b> capl-l 1 <b>was</b> the most toxic one to adult females (LC 50 = 0. 849 %) while natur'l <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the least (LC 50 = 4. 691 %), respectively. In contrast, natur'l <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> proved to be highly toxic to predator eggs while bio-dux <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the least effective oil against the egg stage. Females of N. cucumeris suffered a depression in reproduction when females treated and fed on prey formerly kept on treated plant leaves with LC 50 concentration of each oil used in our studies. Rosemary and sweet marjoram as well as bio-dux <b>oils</b> seem to <b>be</b> slightly harmful to N. cucumeris at (LC 50) concentration of each oil...|$|R
5|$|Linseed oil's {{properties}} as a polymer make it highly {{suitable for}} wood finishing, {{for use in}} oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty and in making linoleum. When used in food or medicinally, linseed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> called flaxseed oil.|$|E
5|$|North Sea Brent Crude <b>Oil</b> <b>is</b> {{the leading}} {{benchmark}} for Atlantic basin crude oils, {{and is used}} to price approximately two-thirds of the world's traded crude oil. Other well-known benchmarks are West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Dubai Crude, Oman Crude, and Urals oil.|$|E
5|$|Rice bran <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{a highly}} stable cooking and salad oil, {{suitable}} for high-temperature cooking. It also has {{potential as a}} biofuel.|$|E
50|$|Essential <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> not <b>oils</b> but {{volatile}} aromatic {{compounds that}} are used in flavors, fragrances, and in aroma therapy for health purposes. Essential <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> usually extracted by distillation.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of lubricants made from mineral <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Types and compositions of base stocks are reviewed {{and the product}} demands and compositions of typical products are outlined. Processes for commercial production of mineral <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> examined. Tables of data are included to show examples of product types and requirements. A chemical analysis of three types of mineral <b>oils</b> <b>is</b> reported...|$|R
50|$|Peanut oil and {{safflower}} <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> {{the primary}} cooking oils, although sunflower oil and cottonseed <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> also used. Clarified butter (called ghee) {{is often used}} for its distinct flavor.|$|R
5|$|Tigernut oil (or nut-sedge <b>oil)</b> <b>is</b> pressed {{from the}} tuber of Cyperus esculentus. It has {{properties}} similar to soybean, sunflower and rapeseed oils. It {{is used in}} cooking and making soap and has potential as a biodiesel fuel.|$|E
5|$|Tomato seed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> a {{potentially}} valuable by-product, as a cooking oil, from the waste seeds generated from processing tomatoes.|$|E
5|$|Vernonia <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} from {{the seeds of}} the Vernonia galamensis. It is composed of 73–80% vernolic acid, which {{can be used to make}} epoxies for manufacturing adhesives, varnishes and paints, and industrial coatings.|$|E
5000|$|On March 18, 2006, {{approximately}} [...] {{of crude}} <b>oil</b> <b>were</b> released when a pump failed at Enbridge's Willmar terminal in Saskatchewan. According to Enbridge, {{roughly half the}} <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> recovered.|$|R
30|$|Pure {{vegetable}} <b>oil,</b> from rapeseed, <b>was</b> {{obtained from}} a local supermarket. Waste frying <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> provided by a food establishment, which deep-fries chips and chicken. Heated <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> obtained by heating pure vegetable oil in an open container at 180 °C for 1 week. 180 °C is a common frying temperature (Costa et al. 2001). All <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> sterilised separately in a steam autoclave and added directly to fermentations. Since the <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> either refined or subjected to prolonged heating, only few spores {{were present in the}} oils. Speadplating of 1 ml of oil on TSA showed no colonies after incubation at 30 °C for 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} at Norphlet in 1922. The formation {{in which the}} <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> discovered led to 'Norphlet' becoming a geological term - a Norphlet Formation is a Jurassic Sandstone Formation.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|Mafura oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of Trichilia emetica. Used as an edible oil in Ethiopia. Mafura butter, extracted {{as part of the}} same process when extracting the <b>oil,</b> <b>is</b> not edible, and is used in soap and candle making, as a body ointment, as fuel, and medicinally.|$|E
5|$|Many {{trees have}} flowers rich in nectar which are {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas {{of the developing world}} where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied. Sassafras <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
40|$|Deep-frying oil {{properties}} of diacylglycerol-rich cooking <b>oil</b> (DG <b>oil)</b> <b>were</b> examined {{so as to}} assess the extent of thermal oxidative stability. The results obtained were {{compared with those of}} triacylglycerol-rich cooking oil (TG oil). Dehydration and oil absorption of food materials using DG <b>oil</b> <b>were</b> lower than those of TG oil. Color difference (⊿E value) of both oils increased with the number of uses, but ⊿E value of DG <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> higher than that of TG oil. Moisture content of "koromo" using DG <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> higher than that of TG oil. Carbonyl, p-anisidin and acid values of both oils increased with the number of uses. The immediate evaluation of fried foods after frying using both <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> better than those of 120 minutes' later ones. The present findings indicate that the thermal oxidation of DG <b>oil</b> during deep-frying <b>is</b> basically {{the same as that of}} TG oil. DG <b>oil</b> can <b>be</b> used for deep-frying oil in the same way as TG oil...|$|R
40|$|Lavender, anise, chamomile, fennel, geranium, oregano, parsley, {{and sage}} {{essential}} <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> tested for their effectiveness against mushroom pathogens: Verticillium fungicola var. fungicola, Mycogone perniciosa, and Cladobotryum sp. Isolates {{were exposed to}} the volatile phase of the oils and then ventilated in order to determine if the effect of the <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> lethal to the pathogen. Oregano and geranium <b>oils</b> <b>were</b> the most toxic, having a fungicidal effect at 0. 02 - 0. 08 μl/ml of air, depending on the pathogen. Oregano <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> characterized by high content of carvacrol and thymol, while citranelol and geraniol were the main components of geranium oil...|$|R
