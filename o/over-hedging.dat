40|$|In this article, we show, in {{the context}} of partial hedging, that some {{important}} relationships about comonotonicity and convex order cannot be translated to countermonotonicity in general because of the possibility of <b>over-hedging.</b> We propose a new notion, called proper hedge, that can effectively avoid <b>over-hedging.</b> Different characterizations of a proper hedge are given, and we show that this notion is useful in translating relationships between comonotonicity and convex order to the case of counter-monotonicity. As an application in the insurance context, we apply our results to identify desirable structural properties of insurance indemnities that make an insurance contract appealing to both the policyholder and the insurer...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{corporations}} should choose their optimal mix of linear and non-linear derivatives. We present {{a model in}} which a firm facing both business (output) and market (price) risk maximizes its expected cash flows when subject to financial distress costs. The optimal hedging position is generally comprised of linear contracts, but as the levels of business and market risk increase, the use of linear contracts will decline due to {{the risks associated with}} <b>over-hedging.</b> At the same time, a substitution effect occurs towards the use of non-linear contracts. The degree of substitution will depend on the correlation between output levels and market prices, the firm's financial leverage, and its transaction cost structure. Our empirical tests support various predictions of the model as related to business risk, leverage and firm size...|$|E
40|$|This is a corpus-based, {{empirical}} study, which investigates Swedish advanced learners’ {{written and}} spoken English {{with regard to}} modification of adjectives, both reinforcing (e. g. totally different, very nice) and attenuating (e. g. kind of false, somewhat cynical). More specifically, it aims to clarify to what degree and in what ways Swedish learners differ from native speakers of English as to frequency, choice of modifier and collocations with adjectives. Possible reasons are suggested for the differences found and are discussed in relation to second language learning. The investigation is based on comparable learner and native-speaker corpora, from which quantitative data are drawn and used {{as a point of}} departure for a more qualitative approach. Differences in comparison with the native-speaker corpus are referred to as “overuse” and “underuse”, respectively. As matters of ambiguity or vagueness may interfere with definitions of linguistic categories, the study discusses and exemplifies a number of such cases, involving, e. g., semantic blends, variable scope and context-dependent function variation, all of them related to the process of selecting relevant data from the corpus material. The investigation shows that the Swedish learners overuse both adjectives and modifiers in their written texts. This applies especially to “all-purpose”, relatively informal modifiers, such as the reinforcers totally, very and really, and the attenuators quite, fairly and more or less. Underused modifiers are of the type that combines with a smaller set of adjectives, viz. all (e. g. all important, all female) and directly (e. g. directly applicable), pointing to a lack of experience in formal writing among the Swedish students. Examples of unidiomatic usage are also found, e. g. scaringly clear and completely headless, suggesting transfer from Swedish expressions. The comparison of the spoken corpora shows many similarities in modifier use. There are also differences, indicating <b>over-hedging</b> and underuse of emphatic expressions such as just amazing and absolutely brilliant, as well as the modifiers quite and really. Adopting a somewhat wider perspective, the study concludes with a discussion of the increasing degree of informality in written language, as well as the relevance of being nativelike in oral production of L 2 English. Some pedagogical implications in this connection are the need to increase Swedish students’ awareness of different genres, especially as regards formal written English, and, for spoken English, to make special note of certain frequently used expressions as well as changes and recent trends...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal {{design of a}} futures hedge program by a com-petitive firm under output price uncertainty. Due to a capital constraint and the marking-to-market procedure of futures contracts, the firm faces endoge-nous liquidity risk. If the futures prices are sufficiently positively correlated, we show that the capital constraint is non-binding in that the optimal amount of capital earmarked to the futures hedge program {{is less than the}} firm’s capital endowment. Otherwise, we show that the capital constraint becomes binding in that the firm optimally puts aside all of its capital stock for the futures hedge program. In the case of non-binding capital constraint, we show that the firm’s optimal futures position is likely to be an <b>over-hedge</b> for reasonable preferences. In the case of binding capital constraint, the firm’s optimal futures position is an under-hedge or an <b>over-hedge,</b> depending on whether the autocorrelation co-efficient of the futures price dynamics is below or above a critical positive value, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} an exporting firm that exports to two foreign countries, {{each of which has}} its own currency. Hedging is imperfect in that the firm can only trade one of the two foreign currencies forward. Compared to the case wherein hedging is perfect in that both foreign currencies can be traded forward, the firm is shown to produce less in the home country. Furthermore, the firm is shown to export more (less) to the foreign country whose currency can (cannot) be traded forward.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} a competitive firm that faces joint price and inflation risk. Given that the price risk is negatively correlated with the inflation risk in the sense of expectation dependence, we show that the firm optimally opts for an <b>over-hedge</b> (under-hedge) if the firm's coefficient of relative risk aversion is everywhere no greater (no smaller) than unity. We show further that banning the firm from forward trading may induce the firm to produce more or less, depending on whether the price risk premium is positive or negative, respectively. While the price risk premium is unambiguously negative {{in the absence of the}} inflation risk, it is not the case when the inflation risk prevails. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, forward hedging needs not always promote production should firms take inflation seriously. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hedging decision {{of an international}} firm facing ex-change rate risk exposure to a foreign currency cash flow. Financial markets are incomplete in {{that there are no}} hedging instruments directly related to the home currency. There is, however, an unbiased currency forward market between the foreign currency and a third currency accessible to the firm. A tri-angular parity condition holds among the home, foreign, and third currencies, thereby making cross-hedging opportunities available. If the spot exchange rate of the home currency against the third currency and that of the third currency against the foreign currency are positively (negatively) correlated in the sense of regression dependence, we show that the firm’s optimal forward position is an under-hedge or an <b>over-hedge,</b> depending on whether the firm’s Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is everywhere less (greater) or greater (less) than unity, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the competitive firm under output price uncertainty and state-dependent preferences. When there is a futures market for hedging purposes, the firm's optimal production decision is independent of the output price uncertainty and of the state-dependent preferences. If the futures contracts are unbiased, the firm's optimal futures position is an <b>over-hedge</b> or an under-hedge, depending on whether the firm is correlation averse or correlation loving, and on whether the output price is positively or negatively expectation dependent on the state variable. When the firm has access not only to the unbiased futures but also to fairly priced options, sufficient conditions are derived under which the firm's optimal hedge position includes both hedging instruments. This study thus establishes a hedging role of options, which is over and above that of futures, in the case of state-dependent preferences. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal {{design of a}} futures hedge program for a risk-averse multinational firm (MNF) under exchange rate uncertainty. All currency futures contracts are marked to market and require interim cash settlement of gains and losses. The MNF commits to prematurely liquidating its futures position on which the interim loss incurred exceeds a threshold level (i. e., the liquidation threshold). When the liquidation threshold is exogenously given, we show that the MNF optimally opts for an under-hedge (an <b>over-hedge)</b> should the futures exchange rates be not too (sufficiently) positively autocorrelated. When the liquidation threshold is endogenously determined, we show that the MNF voluntarily chooses to prematurely liquidate its futures position only if the futures exchange rates are positively autocorrelated. In {{the case that the}} futures exchange rates are uncorrelated or negatively autocorrelated, the MNF prefers not to commit to any finite liquidation thresholds. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. postprin...|$|R

All futures contracts are unbiased and marked to market in that they require interim cash settlement of gains and losses. The futures price dynamics follows a first-order autoregression with a random walk serving as a special case. The firm's futures hedge program is constituted of an endogenous provision for premature termination, which depends on how the futures prices are autocorrelated. Succinctly, the firm voluntarily commits to premature liquidation of its futures position on which the interim loss incurred exceeds a predetermined threshold level if the futures prices are positively autocorrelated. In this case, the liquidity constrained firm optimally opts for an <b>over-hedge</b> if its preferences exhibit either constant or increasing absolute risk aversion.

40|$|Multiple {{delivery}} specifications {{exist on}} nearly all commodity futures contracts. Sellers are typically allowed {{to choose among}} several grades of the underlying commodity. On the delivery day, the futures price converges to the spot price of the cheapest-to-deliver grade rather than {{to that of the}} par-delivery grade of the commodity, thereby imposing an additional delivery risk on hedgers. This paper derives the optimal production and futures hedging strategy for a risk-averse competitive firm facing delivery risk. We show that the option value of the multiple delivery specification induces the firm to produce more with than without the delivery risk if the firm gauges this value higher than the market. We further show that if the delivery risk is additively related to the commodity price risk, the firm optimally under-hedges its risk exposure. On the other hand, if the delivery risk is multiplicatively related to the commodity price risk, the firm may optimally choose an under- or <b>over-hedge</b> which we illustrate using a numerical example. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an international}} Cournot duopoly wherein a home firm and a foreign firm {{compete in the}} home market under exchange rate uncertainty. The foreign exporting firm, being risk averse, has incentives to hedge its exchange rate risk exposure. In a two-stage setting, we show that hedging via an unbiased currency futures market acts as a strategic device. In particular, under either constant or decreasing absolute risk aversion, {{an increase in the}} hedging volume of the foreign firm promotes its exports and deters the home firm’s output. In contrast to the well-known full-hedging result in a perfectly competitive environment, we find that the foreign firm <b>over-hedges</b> for strategic reasons. Furthermore, the separation result from the hedging literature under perfect competition no longer holds in our duopoly framework, i. e., equilibrium output levels depend on the risk attitude of the foreign firm as well as the probability distribution of the spot exchange rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the competitive firm under correlated price and background risk when a futures market exists for hedging purposes. We show that imposing the background risk, be it additive or multiplicative, on the firm has no effect on the separation theorem. The full-hedging theorem, however, holds if the background risk is independent of the price risk. In the general case of the correlated price and background risk, we adopt the concept of expectation dependence to describe the bivariate dependence structure. When the background risk is additive, the firm finds it optimal to opt for an <b>over-hedge</b> or an under-hedge, depending on whether the price risk is positively or negatively expectation dependent on the background risk, respectively. When the background risk is multiplicative, both the concept of expectation dependence and the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion are called for to determine the firm's optimal futures position. © 2012 The Author(s). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the competitive firm under price uncertainty. The firm has access to a futures market for hedging purposes. Basis risk exists because the random spot and futures prices are not identical at the time when the futures contracts mature. We show that the firm optimally produces less in the presence than {{in the absence of the}} basis risk. We show further that the concept of expectation dependence that describes how the basis risk is correlated with either the random spot price or the random futures price plays a pivotal role in determining the firm's optimal futures position. Specifically, an under-hedge is optimal if either the random spot price or the random futures price is negatively expectation dependent on the basis risk. On the other hand, an <b>over-hedge</b> is optimal if the random futures price is positively expectation dependent on the basis risk. The firm's optimal futures position becomes indeterminate if the random spot price is positively expectation dependent on the basis risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal lending and hedging decisions {{of a bank}} facing uncertain returns on its loans. The bank's preferences are state-dependent in that the utility function depends on a state variable, i. e. the business cycle of the economy. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to complement the results of the banking literature. To characterize the bank's optimal use of financial instruments to hedge, we show that the concept of expectation dependence (Wright, 1987) is useful. While the current hedging literature specifies price risk as a monotonically increasing or decreasing function of the state-variable plus noise, expectation dependence provides much more general bivariate dependence structure. The bank's optimal futures position is an under-hedge or an <b>over-hedge,</b> depending on whether the random return on loans is positively or negatively correlated with the business cycle of the economy in the sense of expectation dependence, respectively. The bank as such takes dependencies into consideration when devising its optimal hedging strategy...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the local}} {{volatility}} hedge ratios {{that are consistent}} with a stochastic instantaneous volatility and show that this ‘stochastic local volatility’ model is equivalent to the market model for implied volatilities. We also show that a common feature of all Markovian single factor stochastic volatility models, (log) normal mixture option pricing models and ‘sticky delta’ models is that they predict incorrect dynamics for implied volatility. As a result they <b>over-hedge</b> the Black-Scholes model {{in the presence of a}} market skew and this explains the poor delta hedging performance of these models reported in the literature. Whilst the traditional ‘sticky tree’ local volatility models do not possess this unfortunate property, they cannot be used for pricing without exogenous and ad hoc smoothing of results. However the stochastic local volatility framework allows one to extend a good pricing model into a good hedging model. The theoretical results are supported by an empirical analysis of the hedging performance of seven models, each with different volatility characteristics, on the SP 500 index skew.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the production and}} futures hedging decisions of the competitive firm under output price uncertainty and with state-dependent background risk. We show that the firm's optimal production decision is independent of the underlying uncertainty and of the firm's risk attitude. We further show that the firm's optimal futures position is a full-hedge that completely eliminates the output price risk if either the background risk is state-independent, or the firm's utility function is quadratic. When the firm's preferences exhibit prudence, an under-hedge or an <b>over-hedge</b> is optimal should {{the magnitude of the}} background risk vary in a monotonic manner with changes in the realized state. When the prudent firm has access not only to the unbiased futures contracts but also to fairly priced options, we construct a reasonable example wherein the firm optimally includes the options in its hedge position. Hence, we offer a rationale for the hedging role of options, which is over and above that of futures, in the case of state-dependent background risk. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the production and}} hedging decisions of a globally competitive firm under exchange rate uncertainty. The firm is risk averse and possesses export flexibility in that it can distribute its output to either the domestic market or a foreign market after observing the realized spot exchange rate. To hedge against its exchange rate risk exposure, the firm can trade fairly priced currency call options of an arbitrary strike price. We show that both the separation and the full-hedging results hold if the strike price of the currency call options is set equal to {{the ratio of the}} domestic and foreign selling prices. Otherwise, neither result holds. Specifically, we show that the optimal level of output is always less than that of an otherwise identical firm that is risk neutral. Furthermore, an under-hedge (<b>over-hedge)</b> is optimal whenever the strike price of the currency call options is below (above) the ratio of the domestic and foreign selling prices. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Board of Trustees of the Bulletin of Economic Research 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Housing plays {{a crucial}} role in household’s wealth and it is a crucial part of the household’s {{consumption}} plan. As {{one of the most important}} consumption markets in the U. S., the performance of the housing market is closely related to the overall economy. Given these considerations, it is important to examine the housing and mortgage markets and their effects theoretically and empirically. Essay One builds a model to explain what happens to housing consumption when both rent risk and the correlation between rents and labor income are present. We find that buying an entire house is an <b>over-hedge</b> against the future rent risk, and with the presence of both rent risk and a correlation between rents and labor income, the diversification effect is ambiguous even with the assumption of no second period housing consumption. Essay Two builds an option value model of home occupancy. As a renter, the timing to buy is important since both the rents and the housing prices are stochastic. I build an option value model to price the renter’s value to wait. There is about a 3 - 4 % option value to wait in Chicago based on a geometric Brownian motion housing price assumption, and the value rises to 12 % if we instead use a Bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process featuring mean-reverting and positive auto-correlation to model the housing prices. This occurs because the renter can use historical information, wait and capture a relatively low housing price compared to discounted future rents. Essay Three studies high cost lending and foreclosures. We find that the level of high cost lending activities in a neighborhood has a significant effect on mortgage foreclosures, even after controlling for neighborhood by year fixed effects and neighborhood trends. Also, the neighborhood effect is caused by the lenders’ activities in the neighborhood. We examine the lender penetration and find that when new high cost lenders move to the neighborhood and start to make high cost loans, they affect the existing lenders and their activities together can explain the higher foreclosure rate in the neighborhoods with more rate spread loans...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} endeavoured to propose and {{implement}} a series of diagnostic tests to determine the appropriateness of electricity simulation engines (ESEs) for generating electricity load and price paths {{to be used as}} input in the determination of a retailer’s earnings distribution and the assessment of earnings-at-risk (EaR) measures. Additional diagnostic measures require development before a routine can be developed whereby a complete diagnostic report can be generated as output using simulated and historical data as input. This work includes: (1) Further partitioning of output load and prices from an ESE into off-peak, peak and weekend periods to determine the subsequent effect on earnings. (2) The diagnosis of simulated load paths. As simulated load was not supplied for all engines, the diagnostics developed in this report did not include an analysis of load. (3) The building of a response surface to capture the interaction between temperature, load and price. (4) Examination of the convergence behaviour of an ESE. Convergence in this context means the determination of the minimum number of load and price paths required from a simulator in order to return expected profiles that conform to industry expectations. This would involve the sequential testing of an increasing number of simulated paths from an ESE {{in order to determine the}} number required. In conclusion, it is important to understand that each of the simulators that were diagnosed in this study were criticised according to industry expectations, and to the degree that the diagnostics employed here reflect those expectations. In fact, all simulators will attract criticism given that they are calibrated on historical data and are expected to generate future prices for market conditions that are unknown. The mark of an appropriate ESE is that the future load and pricing structure it generates is not too much at variance with industry expectations. A critical function of a simulator is for it not to overestimate or underestimate load and prices such that the risk metrics used to govern earnings risk faced by an electricity retailer are compromised to the extent that their book is either grossly <b>over-hedged</b> or under-hedged...|$|R
