5|$|The {{cerebellum}} of cartilaginous and {{bony fishes}} is extraordinarily large and complex. In {{at least one}} important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger {{than the rest of}} the brain put together. The largest part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.|$|E

Another Meralco subtransmission line enters the expressway and adjacent to the said substation is a plant of Atlas Feeds. The Philippine Arena can be seen on this segment.
