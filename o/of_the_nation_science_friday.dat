40|$|THEMATTHEWEFFECT FOR COUNTRIES (MEC) {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematic deviation in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> actual (observed) citations from <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> expected citations: Afew countries, {{expecting a}} high impact (i. e., {{a high number}} of cites per paper) receive a surplus <b>of</b> citations, while <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> countries, expecting a lower impact, lose citations. The MEC is characterized by numerous facets, but two are the most impressive. The first is <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> ranking <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>nations</b> by their overall efficiency of scientific performance, thus making the MEC attractive for science policy. The second is <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MEC in a small number of scientific journals which happen to be the most competitive markets for scientific papers and, therefore, are of interest to librarians as well as scientists. First, by using an appropriate measure for <b>the</b> above-mentioned deviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed from the expected citation rate one can bring the countries under investigation into a rank order, which is almost stable over time and independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main scientific fields and the size (i. e., publication output) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participating countries. Metaphorically speaking, this country rank distribution shows {{the extent to which a}} country is using its scientific talents. This is <b>the</b> first facet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MEC. The second facet appears when one studies the mechanism (i. e., microstructure) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MEC. Everyjournal contributes to the MEC. <b>The</b> “atoms” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MEC are redistributed citations, whose number turns out to be a new and sensitive indicator for any scientific journal. Bringing the journals into a rank order according to this indicator, one finds that only 144 journals out of 2, 712 contain half of all redistributed citations, and thu...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study will analyse <b>the</b> views <b>of</b> {{two types of}} medical scientist working in one region <b>of</b> New Zealand. <b>The</b> first group, medical scientific officers (MSO) who are employed by hospital and university laboratories, do research on diseases to develop vaccines and medications. The second group, medical laboratory scientists (MLS), provides the test results essential for use by clinical medical staff in the detection, monitoring or prevention of disease. (There is some crossover <b>of</b> duties). <b>The</b> 35 scientists interviewed were told the emphasis was on issues which help or hinder their work and in particular matters of ‘bureaucracy or paper work’. The aim was to find what scientists, management and government {{need to do to}} provide an effective environment toward meeting the New Zealand government’s goal for growth in science and biotechnology as an export earner. Overwhelmingly, the claim was made that scientists were beset with too much unnecessary management and government bureaucracy. Medical scientific officers (MSOs) believe hospital managers are cutting back on scientific officers and replacing them with lesser qualified medical laboratory scientists (MLSs) to the serious long term detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> They regard <b>science</b> as a poor option for young people to enter, much better tenure is needed, as is more freedom to carry out productive research without people outside of their specialty telling them what they can or cannot do. A key finding is the strong need for more clinical direction. Ideas with potential are not acted on quickly enough because ideas are tied up inappropriately in intellectual property secrecy. Innovative MSOs and MLSs as well as medical doctors need more support from management and peers to develop new ideas. Of great concern was the finding from nearly all MSOs and some MLSs, that there was deep mistrust of management. They wanted a more congenial management and thought there needed to be more management co-operation between universities and hospitals. E. g. have common administration and services. The good news is that there are some groups working well and these provide a successful model for others. Finally, as permission for this study was willingly given by laboratory and university management, this indicates a willingness from management to help scientists. However, as the theory will show, until <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> trust is overcome, some management improvement programmes may fail...|$|R
