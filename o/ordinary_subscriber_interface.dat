40|$|Abstract: The <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuit (SLIC) {{provides}} DC power, ringing {{and supervision}} functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone {{is a prerequisite}} but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs have also been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This application note provides a detailed design procedure for the flyback transformer {{that can be used}} with MAX 1856 in SLIC power supplies. The MAX 1856 offers a low cost solution for generating <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuits (SLIC) power supplies. The SLIC provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone is a prerequisite but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs which incorporate the ringer function, have been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This document presents a sampling of power supply reference designs for use with typical SLICs in two- channel and four-channel POTS loops. Each application has specialized requirements depending on the number of channels serviced and loop length. The requirements for three typical applications are presented in Table 1...|$|R

This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.|$|R
50|$|A {{line card}} {{typically}} interfaces the twisted pair cable of a {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) local loop {{to the public}} switched telephone network (PSTN). Telephone line cards perform multiple tasks, such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of voice, off-hook detection, ring supervision, line integrity tests, and other BORSCHT functions. In some telephone exchange designs, the line cards generate ringing current and decode DTMF signals. The line card in a subscriber loop carrier is called a <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> card (SLIC).|$|R

50|$|The {{telephone}} company maintains large battery systems that supply DC line voltage {{for the operation}} of analog telephone service at customer locations. The voltage supplied is a compromise between operational needs for reliable service and safety precautions for customers and service personnel. The length of the line to a customer telephone interface presents a resistance across which the central office voltage experiences a drop and therefore the voltage at the customer site may vary. The nominal battery (system) voltage is 52.1 V, based on a 24-cell lead-acid battery. The voltage at a <b>subscriber's</b> network <b>interface</b> is typically 48 V between the ring and tip wires.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} Volterra {{approach}} and assuming fading memory, a very efficient method to identify weakly non-linear systems is presented. Making special assumptions on the Volterra kernels, one {{ends up in}} the Hammerstein model, which has less complexity than the Volterra model, thus reducing the numerical effort. Using FIR filters to realize the Hammerstein model, no starting values are necessary to solve the linear optimization problem. To deal with the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, special regularization techniques have been used. Applying these methods to a large scale analog integrated circuitry, namely a broadband SLIC (<b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuitry) for a splitter-less ADSL-Lite central office application, results are given for the buffer, consisting of a few hundred components in BiCMOS technology...|$|R
40|$|A <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuit which {{includes}} a transient signal detector with temporal hysteresis. During steady state operation, the drive current for the subscriber loop allows the loop to respond to changes in loop conditions according to a steady state time constant of the loop filter. Upon detection of a line voltage transient which exceeds a predetermined threshold in either a positive or negative direction, the filter time constant is significantly reduced (e. g., 100 : 1) and held at such reduced value following the initial transient and for a predetermined time period after the line voltage has fallen back below such predetermined threshold. This allows the transient conditions to be fully compensated prior to resetting the filter time constant back from the lower transient value to the higher steady state value...|$|R
40|$|A {{signal line}} driving circuit with power control for {{selectively}} reducing internal power dissipation when driving an external load. While driving the external load with a constant current the output voltage generated across such load is monitored. If the load impedance decreases sufficiently {{to cause the}} output voltage to fall below a predetermined threshold value and, therefore, cause the voltage across the signal line driving circuit to increase, {{the magnitude of the}} power supply voltage is automatically reduced, thereby reducing the voltage across the signal line driving circuit. Such a signal line driving circuit is particularly advantageous as a <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuit (SLIC). As the subscriber goes from an on-hook condition to an off-hook condition and if the subscriber loop is sufficiently short (or low in impedance), a lower power supply voltage is used to minimize the power dissipation of the SLIC while still maintaining the required subscriber loop current...|$|R
40|$|Switching {{noise is}} an {{increasingly}} serious {{concern in the}} design of mixedsignal integrated circuits. This paper describes the influence of signal correlated transients produced in the digital part of a CODEC chip and measures to improve the insensitivity of the analog part. Additionally, the circuit behaviour in case of electromagnetic interference will be discussed. I. INTRODUCTION The scaling of VLSI technologies opens the possibility to realize complete systems that integrate complex, digital circuits together with high-performance analog circuits. An example for such a mixed signal design is the SLICOFI, an integrated one chip <b>Subscriber</b> Line <b>Interface</b> and CODEC Filter.

40|$|Web service {{interfaces}} {{are considered}} {{as one of the}} critical components of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and they represent contracts between web service providers and clients (<b>subscribers).</b> These <b>interfaces</b> are frequently modified to meet new requirements. However, these changes in a web service interface typically affect the systems of its subscribers. Thus, it is important for subscribers to estimate the risk of using a specific service and to compare its evolution to other services offering the same features {{in order to reduce the}} effort of adapting their applications in the next releases. In addition, the prediction of interface changes may help web service providers to better manage available resources (e. g. programmers’ availability, hard deadlines, etc.) and efficiently schedule required maintenance activities to improve the quality. In this research, we propose to use machine learning, based on times series, for the prediction of web service antipatterns. To this end, we collected training data from quality metrics of previous releases from 8 web services. The validation of our prediction techniques shows that the predicted metrics value, such as number of operations, which are used to feed the antipattern detection rules on the different releases of the 8 web services were similar to the expected ones with a very low deviation rate. In addition, most of the quality issues of the studied Web service interfaces were accurately predicted, for the next releases. The survey conducted with active developers also shows the relevance of prediction technique for both service providers and subscribers...|$|R

40|$|A digital {{subscriber}} line access multiplexer (DSLAM, often pronounced dee-slam) is a network device, often located in the telephone exchanges of the telecommunications operators. It connects multiple customer digital <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) <b>interfaces</b> to a high-speed digital communications channel using multiplexing techniques. The DSLAM equipment collects the data from its many modem ports and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite "signal" via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), frame relay, and/or Internet Protocol network (i. e., an IP-DSLAM using PTM-TC [Packet Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence]) protocol(s) stack. A DSLAM {{may or may not}} be located in the telephone exchange, and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface, sometimes in conjunction with a digital loop carrier. DSLAMs are also used by hotels, lodges, residential neighborhoods, and other businesses operating their own private telephone exchange In addition to being a data switch and multiplexer, a DSLAM is also a large collection of modems. Each modem on the aggregation card communicates with a single subscriber's DSL modem. This modem functionality is integrated into the DSLAM itself instead of being done via an external device like a traditional computer modem. By placing additional DSLAMs at locations remote from the telephone exchange, telephone companies provide DSL service to locations previously beyond effective range.  </p...|$|R
