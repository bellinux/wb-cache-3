5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

25|$|Inflation under Bush has {{remained}} near historic lows at about 2-3% per year. The recession and {{a drop in}} some prices led to concern about deflation from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> caused concern about increasing inflation.|$|E

30|$|The {{contribution}} rate of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> fluctuates during the periods, and the {{contribution rate}} is very small, {{and it becomes}} steady near 0.35 %. That is to say, the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>has</b> a slight and unstable effect on carbon <b>price.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> decreases {{in the first three}} periods and then rises. The <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>has</b> a positive effect on the carbon price. That is to say, when the carbon price rises, the enterprises transform their use of coal to oil sources and this increases the <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Furthermore, the government encourages the enterprises to utilize cleaner sources or renewable sources. In contrast, a rise in the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> will lead to more use of coal and promote an increase in carbon price.|$|R
25|$|Although North Sea oil {{production}} {{has been declining}} since 1999, an estimated 920 million tonnes of recoverable crude oil remained in 2009. Over {{two and a half}} billion tonnes were recovered from UK offshore oil fields between the first North Sea crude coming ashore in 1975 and 2002, with most oil fields being expected to remain economically viable until at least 2020. High <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a resurgence of oil exploration, specifically in the North East Atlantic basin to the west of Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, in areas that were previously considered marginal and unprofitable. The North Sea oil and gas industry contributed £35billion to the UK economy (a little under 1% of GDP) in 2014 and is expected to decline in the coming years.|$|E

40|$|Using Markov-switching models, we {{investigate}} whether <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks <b>have</b> nonlinear effects on stock returns. Empirical evidence from {{a set of}} international stock indexes suggests that an increase in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> <b>has</b> a negative and significant impact on stock prices in one state of the economy, whereas this effect is significantly dampened in another state of the economy. Furthermore, it is shown that changes in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> or in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> volatility do {{not lead to a}} higher probability of switching between regimes. ...|$|R

30|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>has</b> a {{significant}} impact on the NPV because of two factors. Firstly, the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>has</b> a direct influence on the total revenue of the project, and is a key factor in determining annual cash flows. Secondly, <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is volatile, and has a great contribution to the variance of NPV. OOIP also has a great influence on the NPV, and its impact on the NPV is similar to that of <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> However, its impact on the annual cash flow is transmitted by the production curve, and not as direct as <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> thus, its impact on the NPV is smaller than <b>oil</b> <b>price’s.</b> Opex per barrel also influences the NPV. But as its value is small and the variation range is narrow, its impact on the annual cash flow is not large. Consequently, its impact on the NPV is relatively weak.|$|R

40|$|The paper aims to {{research}} the effects of real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on real exchanges rates in oil dependent countries. Panel data for 1995 - 2014 of 5 oil dependent countries is taken into consideration for this purpose.

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in {{international}} macroeconomics is relative price movements and their sources. One such price is the <b>price</b> of crude <b>oil.</b> An increase in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> leads to a transfer of income from importing to exporting countries through a shift in terms of trade. The general mechanism by which <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> affect the economic performance is well under-stood. However, the dynamics of these effects – especially the adjustment {{to the terms of}} trade – are uncertain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the impact of an increase in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> on the terms of trade during the time period 1970 to 2004. The relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and world business cycle as well as the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> GWP and Saudi Arabia’s export is also examined in this paper. The regression results show that an increase in <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> <b>has</b> a negative impact on terms of trade for the net importing country.
