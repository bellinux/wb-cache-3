The reduced SWCNT are not only soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to form a stable solution/suspension, but also react spontaneously at room temperature with DMSO to evolve hydrocarbon gases and are converted into functionalized SWCNT. The degree of functionalization is about 2 C% and the addends are mainly methyl and small <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The functionalized SWCNT are apparently more soluble and stable in DMSO solution. It may open a new era for further processing and applications. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

USE - The process is useful for the extraction of hydrocarbons, preferably of liquid gas and/or a gas mixture similar to natural gas or one of its components from a starting material containing the <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> ADVANTAGE - The process: provides improved carbon-carbon bond (e. g. carbon-heteroatom bond) cleavage than the conventional methods; does not require costly downstream process, thus can be used in large scale production...|$|E

Besides, the first peak point (the combustion of volatile compounds) and the second peak point (the delayed release of volatile compounds) of the La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal also decreased by 22.7 and 2.3  °C respectively. This is because the combustion of carbon is a gas–solid two phase reaction. Electromotive force exists on the contact surface between the reactants of the two phases. Because La 3 + has empty d and f orbits to accept lone pair electrons, unsaturated <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> functional groups could grow together and form La 3 +(CO−) 3 species on the fixed carbon (complex salt). This can reduce the potential energy barrier between reactants of the two phases and decrease the activation energy of the reactants, which thus reduces the temperature of the initial release of volatile compounds (Thoms et al. 1996; Morimasa et al. 2001).|$|R

We introduce the environments where this is a problem, briefly mention the alkaliphilic and alkalitolerant degraders of <b>oxygen-containing</b> and chlorinated <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and then focus on species that degrade alkanes and mono- and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{components of}} the aerial parts of Artemisia pontica L., obtained through hydrodistillation, were investigated by GC and GC-MS. The oxygen-containing monoterpene fraction dominated (36. 7 %), while 1. 8 -cineole (14. 1 %) and camphor (13. 9 %) were the main components. Other relatively abundant components in this fraction were terpinen- 4 -ol (3. 0 %), sabina ketone (1. 5 %), dehydro sabina ketone (1. 3 %), and Z-sabineini-hydrate. In the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction (1. 0 %) 7 H-alpha-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (0. 7 %), together with silphin- 1 -ene (trace) and two other silphiperfolene isomers could be identified. 7 H-alpha-Silphiperfol- 5 -ene was identified {{for the first time}} in A. pontica. In the <b>oxygen-containing</b> sesquiterpene <b>hydrocarbon</b> fraction (22. 6 %) a number of silphiperfolene isomers were also found, e. g. silphiperfol- 5 -en- 3 -ol C (9. 7 %), silphiperfol- 5 -en- 3 -one B (0. 7 %), silphiperfol- 5 -en- 3 -yl acetate A (1. 0 %). Most probably, silphiperfol- 5 -en- 3 -ol D (2. 5 %) and silphiperfol- 5 -en- 3 -one A were also present. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|R
40|$|Tar {{content in}} syngas {{pyrolysis}} {{is a serious}} problem for fuel gas utilization in downstream applications. as well as the tar should be converted to gas, or minimized, in order to prevent the damage of downstream applications and im-prove the gas production efficiency. Tar is an undesirable material typically described as a complex mixture of condensable hydrocar-bons, which include single-ring to multiple-ring aromatic com-pounds along with other <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> that easily condense in ambient conditions [1, 2]. The condensable tar deposits on the gas pass-way may cause blockage and corrosion Thermal decomposition is one conventional method used to convert tar to gas with high temperature and long residence time. Besides this effect, the tar is also converted into refractory tar [5]. In other words, thermal decomposition is able to minimize tar quantity and increase the yield of producer gas. In order to eluci-date tar decomposition during the thermal tar decomposition pro-cess, many researchers have utilized one or numerous aromatics as model biomass tar compounds, to investigate the decomposition behavior [1, 6 – 10]. Yet, those studies are based on aromatic combi-nations modeled as biomass tar compounds, and therefore, cannot be practically applied to the real process. Some papers hav...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} epicuticular hydrocarbon {{variation in}} geographically isolated populations of D. mojavensis cultured on different rearing substrates and a sibling species, D. arizonae, with ultraviolet laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (UV-LDI MS). Different body parts, i. e. legs, proboscis, and abdomens, of both species showed qualitatively similar hydrocarbon profiles consisting mainly of long-chain monoenes, dienes, trienes, and tetraenes. However, D. arizonae had higher amounts of most hydrocarbons than D. mojavensis and females of both species exhibited greater hydrocarbon amounts than males. Hydrocarbon profiles of D. mojavensis populations were significantly influenced by sex and rearing substrates, and differed between body parts. Lab food–reared flies had lower amounts of most hydrocarbons than flies reared on fermenting cactus substrates. We discovered 48 male- and species-specific hydrocarbons {{ranging in size}} from C 22 to C 50 in the male anogenital region of both species, most not described before. These included several <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in addition to high intensity signals corresponding to putative triacylglycerides, amounts of which were influenced by larval rearing substrates. Some of these compounds were transferred to female cuticles in high amounts during copulation. This is the first study showing that triacylglycerides may be a separate class of courtship-related signaling molecules in drosophilids. This study also extends the kind and number of epicuticular hydrocarbons in these species and emphasizes the role of larval ecology in influencing amounts of these compounds, many of which mediate courtshi...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the reaction of HCOOH with the (111) surface of platinum and its dependence on surface temperature, surface concentration (coverage), {{and the presence of}} other adspecies such as H[subscript] 2 O, CO, and atomic oxygen. The motivation for this investigation originates in the electrochemical community, where an interest in the development of fuel cells has existed for years. Small <b>oxygen-containing</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> like HCOOH show potential as fuels in cells utilizing platinum as the electrode material. The desired reaction in such a cell is the decomposition of the formic acid to produce CO[subscript] 2, which desorbs from the electrode surface; however, a competing reaction produces adspecies which do not desorb. The accumulation of these adspecies prevents continued adsorption and reaction of formic acid and eventually renders the cell useless;We have probed the reaction of formic acid with Pt(111) in ultrahigh vacuum via thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). TDS experiments show HCOOH decomposes to produce CO[subscript] 2 and H[subscript] 2 for low exposures on clean Pt(111); at higher exposures molecular desorption, in several states, occurs. Coadsorption of atomic oxygen enhances decomposition, while coadsorption of CO retards it. Evidence also exists that CO may cause an alternate decomposition pathway. Interactions involving H[subscript] 2 O do not affect decomposition, but seem to involve hydrogen bonding formation and mutual displacement of HCOOH and H[subscript] 2 O from surface sites;HREELS experiments reveal that, on the clean surface, formic acid at 100 K appears to adsorb molecularly as hydrogen-bonded chains and exhibits a temperature- and coverage-dependent conversion to a bridged formate. Coadsorption of atomic oxygen lowers the temperature of conversion of HCOOH to formate as well as producing a second formate bonding configuration. The presence of CO retards the extent of conversion. Coadsorbed water is observed to undergo a reorientation, a possible result of hydrogen bonding with HCOOH...|$|E
40|$|Stable phenalenyl {{radicals}} {{have great}} potential {{as the basis}} for new materials for applications in the field of molecular electronics. In particular, electronically stabilized phenalenyl species that do not require steric shielding are molecules of fundamental interest, but are notoriously difficult to synthesize. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of two phenalenyl-type cations is reported: planar benzo[i]naphtho[2, 1, 8 -mna]xanthenium (8 +) and helical benzo[a]naphtho[8, 1, 2 -jkl]xanthenium (9 +), which can be reduced to the corresponding radicals. Radical 9 represents the first stable, helical phenalenyl radical which does not rely on bulky substituents to ensure its stability. Both cations are water-soluble, and the radicals are stable for weeks at room temperature under air. These compounds were characterized crystallographically, and also by NMR, EPR, electrochemistry, and electronic spectra. The synthesis of the previously reported compound benzo[5, 6]naphthaceno[1, 12, 11, 10 -jklmna]xanthylium (5 +), the largest <b>oxygen-containing</b> polycyclic <b>hydrocarbon,</b> was undertaken for comparison with 8 + and 9 +, allowing us to report its crystal structure here for the first time. The different properties of these compounds and their radicals are explained by considering their differing aromaticities using in-depth computational methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present {{status of}} {{knowledge}} of the gas-phase reactions of selected classes of volatile non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) [alkanes, alkenes, aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>oxygen-containing</b> NMOCs and nitrogen-containing NMOCs] and their degradation products in the troposphere is briefly discussed. In the troposphere, NMOCs can undergo photolysis, reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical during daylight hours, reaction with the nitrate (NO 3) radical (primarily during nighttime), reaction with ozone (03), and, in certain situations, reaction with the chlorine (Cl) atom. The kinetics and mechanisms of the initial OH radical, NO 3 radical and O 3 reactions are reasonably well understood. However, the subsequent reactions of the organic radicals formed after the initial OH radical, NO 3 radical and 0 3 reactions are in many cases much less well understood, and photolysis of NMOCs under tropospheric conditions is in general a poorly understood area. In the tropospheric degradations of NMOCs, the important intermediate radicals are alkyl or substituted alkyl radicals (R), alkyl peroxy or substituted alkyl peroxy radicals (R 0 2), and alkoxy or substituted alkoxy radicals (R 0). While much {{progress has been made}} in elucidating the reactions of organic peroxy and alkoxy radicals, the mechanisms of the gas-phase reactions of 03 with alkenes, and the mechanisms and products of the OH radical-initiated reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons, there are still areas of uncertainty which impact the ability to accurately model the tropospheric degradations of NMOCs and to predict the products formed. These will be discussed...|$|R
