5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E

25|$|A pair {{of studies}} of the {{influence}} of poverty <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reason about complicated issues requiring an immediate solution found that poverty directly impedes cognitive function. Financial worries appear to put a severe burden on one's mental resources so that they are no longer fully available for solving complicated problems. The reduced capability for problem solving can lead to suboptimal decisions and further perpetuate poverty.|$|E
25|$|Every uniformly {{continuous}} function between metric spaces is continuous. Uniform continuity, unlike continuity, relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> compare {{the sizes of}} neighbourhoods of distinct points of a given space. In an arbitrary topological space, comparing the sizes of neighborhoods may not be possible. Instead, uniform continuity can be defined on a metric space where such comparisons are possible, or more generally on a uniform space.|$|E

The Bothriolepis genus is no exception to this principle. Listed below are a few of the notable species within the genus Bothriolepis; more than sixty species have been named in total, and it is likely that a sizeable proportion of them are valid due to the cosmopolitan nature of Bothriolepis.|$|E
25|$|The SPLA {{traditionally}} employed ghazzi tactics, i.e., motorized surprise raids over great distances, {{which were}} inspired by the traditional camel-back war parties of the Sahrawi tribes. However, after {{the construction of the}} Moroccan Wall this changed into tactics more resembling conventional warfare, with a focus on artillery, snipers and other long-range attacks. In both phases of the war, SPLA units relied on superior knowledge of the terrain, speed and surprise, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> retain experienced fighters.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{management}} of allergic diseases relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make an accurate diagnosis. Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies. Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduces {{the incidence of}} symptoms and need for medications, and improves quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Revival {{started in}} earnest in 1595 when Ferdinand III, who was Jesuit-educated came of age. He had succeeded his father, Charles II in Inner Austria in 1590 and was {{energetic}} in suppressing heresy {{in the provinces}} which he ruled. Reformation Commissionms initiated a process of forced recatholicisation and by 1600 was being imposed on Graz and Klagenfurt. Unlike previous Austrian rulers, Ferdinand III was unconcerned {{about the effect of}} religious conflict <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> withstand the Ottomans.

25|$|Following his predecessor, Durrani set up {{a special}} force closest to him {{consisting}} mostly of his fellow Durranis and other Pashtuns, as well as Tajiks, Qizilbash and other Muslims. He began his military conquest by capturing Ghazni from the Ghiljis and then wresting Kabul from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over Khorasan. Leadership of the various Afghan tribes rested mainly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> provide booty for the clan, and Durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers. Apart from invading the Punjab region three times between the years 1747–1753, he captured Herat in 1750.|$|E

25|$|Other {{than their}} {{inability}} to hear music, which is most likely due to a genetic defect, the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply {{refer to it as}} noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.|$|E

The redox functions of CoQ in cellular energy production and antioxidant protection are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> exchange two electrons in a redox cycle between ubiquinol (reduced CoQ) and ubiquinone (oxidized CoQ). The antioxidant role of the molecule as a free radical scavenger was widely studied by Lars Ernster. Numerous scientists around the globe started studies on this molecule since then in relation to various diseases including cardiovascular diseases and cancer.|$|E
25|$|See also: D. H. Th. Vollenhoven. Developed {{from earlier}} secular traditions, modern Humanist ethical philosophies affirmed {{the dignity and}} worth of all people, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities, particularly rationality, without resorting to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts. For liberal humanists such as Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the young Karl Marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied {{in the form of}} human rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism {{was nothing more than a}} secular version of theism. In his Genealogy of Morals, he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.|$|E
