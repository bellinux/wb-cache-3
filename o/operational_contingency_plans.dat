40|$|In 1998 Norske Skog, {{then known}} as Australian Newsprint Mills, started an {{extensive}} program to reduce odour that was being generated from its effluent treatment plant. Section 4 (iii) of the Pollution reduction Program issued to (then) Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd on June 15 th 1998 required the company to: “Prepare and submit {{a report to the}} EPA on preferred options for introduction of in-line continuous monitoring that identify the onset of conditions for anaerobic decay within individual plant units. The report must identify <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> when the onset of conditions for anaerobic decay are detected by the monitors. ” The purpose of this report is to summarise the work done to fulfil the EPA requirement. At the AWWOA conference in 1998, the first findings were reported on the odour reduction program about to undertaken. This paper highlights the success we achieved in implementing this program as well as further steps that were taken to identify odour potential...|$|E
40|$|Railway {{infrastructure}} {{already has}} some ‘smart’ characteristics, {{in that it}} ‘knows’ where trains are located and can sometimes detect track and other equipment faults. There is considerable scope to increase these capabilities. There is also a significant and urgent need for such improvements: railways have limited operational flexibility and face increasing passenger and freight traffic demand on existing infrastructure. The reliable provision of additional capacity requires improved system ‘self-knowledge’ for traffic control and management purposes, {{as well as for}} system reliability and safety. The use of smart infrastructure for fault prediction and the guidance of preventive maintenance helps to maintain operational capacity. This approach also helps to reduce track access requirements for traditional maintenance and renewals activities, thus increasing network availability and total capacity. Climate change presents the railway industry with significant challenges, notably in terms of flooding and earthworks failures resulting from increased rainfall intensity. Smart infrastructure includes the prediction and monitoring of such events to maintain safety and enable the timely implementation of <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b> This paper draws upon a range of sources to identify the needs for and potential benefits of increased deployment of smart infrastructure and other assets on railways in Britain and elsewhere. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] “The Secretary of the Defense Office of Force Transformation (OFT) is {{currently}} undertaking an initiative, {{which seeks to}} provide operationally responsive access to, and near term tactical exploitation of space. TacSat- 1 is the first adaptive experiment in this initiative, which seeks to exploit access to space within the <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> cycle. ” 5 As this effort becomes successful and scales up to many satellites and other assets, the ground segment quickly becomes the weakest link in that chain as we can foresee thousands of web-enabled space/ground/sea nodes interconnected to provide for a better tactical awareness and more responsive operations. Operational users need to rapidly access the data products they need. If the products do not exist, the ground system needs to quickly discover how to generate them and what sensors to task. Tactical users will not task satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) directly as those assets will become part of an invisible infrastructure available on-demand 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

40|$|Planning and {{decision}} making to manage plant biosecurity risks is inherently complex, often contentious, involves unknowns and uncertainty, {{and needs to be}} adaptable to rapidly changing situations. The aim of this project is to develop a collaborative planning and shared decision making framework that will result in better and faster decisions to respond more quickly to plant biosecurity risks, resulting in reduced impacts and costs, and more equitable and favourable outcomes for stakeholders and affected parties. The key requirements for the collaborative planning {{and decision}} making framework will be developed based on the evaluation and adaptation of existing frameworks for (i) risk analysis, (ii) risk management, (iii) planning {{and decision making}}, (iv) stakeholder engagement, and (iv) risk governance. A number of case studies representative of different biosecurity activities will be analysed to inform the development of the framework. These case studies currently include the emergency response to the tropical race 4 strain of Panama disease affecting banana in north Queensland; comparing cost sharing arrangements for plant biosecurity; contingency planning; and evaluating the technical feasibility of eradicating plant pests. The collaborative planning and decision making framework will be scalable to different levels of strategic, tactical, <b>operational</b> and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> and decision-making in plant biosecurity; and applicable {{to a wide range of}} biosecurity issues, across planning, preparedness, prevention, response, recovery and ongoing management activities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for the formulation of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> to assist school administrators and boards of school trustees during a teacher strike. The study was designed to secure and evaluate strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> items currently being utilized by school administrators as well as ideas suggested through published literature by authorities in the field. An initial survey was conducted to collect strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> and to determine teacher strike experience of 286 Indiana school superintendents and of superintendents throughout the nation identified as having experienced a teacher strike during August and September of 1975. Data collected were used to determine the number of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> in existence in Indiana and in school districts outside Indiana included in the survey, and the experience level of Indiana superintendents in dealing with teacher strikes. The tactical ideas, suggestions, and guideline statements secured from the review of the literature and analysis of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> material received in response to the initial survey were developed into a form for evaluating strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> items. The evaluation form was divided into six sections designed to elicit responses relative to strike <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> One hundred eighty-seven statement items relative to the board of education, superintendent, communication center, transportation, security, and building procedures were included. Superintendents were asked to indicate if the strike plan items should be included in a strike contingency plan- as well as to indicate the degree of importance of each strike plan item in maintaining the operational capacities of a school district during a teacher strike. Ten Indiana superintendents identified as having had experienced one or more teacher strikes and having developed a strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> for use should a strike situation develop served as evaluators.

40|$|Any {{information}} technology(IT) {{system needs}} its computing resources to operate correctly (system integrity) and should maintain {{the value of}} its information (data integ-rity). Unfortunately, adverse events may damage data integrity or system integ-rity or both. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for IT sys-tems focuses on preserving, enabling recovery, or the graceful degradation of system or data integrity. Unfortunately, contingency mechanisms that work in one adverse situation may be hopelessly inadequate in another. Consequently, different <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> types exist for different “disasters. ” The two pri-mary types are physical and logical event <b>plans.</b> Traditional IT <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> address physical events such as flood, fire, earthquake, war, or loss of power. Many sources discuss traditional con-tingency planning, which often empha-sizes replication and physical separation to guard against physical disasters. Such traditional planning does not consider logical events. A logical event (LE) strikes all sites that have similar information configura-tions (software, data, and firmware) —no matter how widely separated. The im-pacted system also may corrupt IT that is down the information flow stream. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> has two subcat-egories: plans for incompletely under-stood systems and plans for well-under-stood systems. Because the Y 2 K problem is an LE, discussion of LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> is appropriate. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> borrows from systems security principles, which include auditing, system modeling, input and output validation, and in-strumentation. This article outlines the properties that a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> strives to preserve, suggests techniques for further investigation in Y 2 K LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning,</b> and explains LE <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> with respect to tradi-tional plans. Y 2 K planning is about risk manage-ment. Risk management involves • Identifying risks (potential threats and vulnerabilities). • Analyzing risks by evaluating, cat-egorizing, and prioritizing them. • <b>Planning</b> for risks. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> reduces to • Creating mechanisms to identify the events that trigger contingency actions. • Defining what the contingency actions are (either automatic or manually executed actions). • Preparing the responsible parties by documenting who they are and by training them to be ready...|$|R

A systematic literature search seeking qualitative research was conducted in April 2014, with no limit placed on date of publication. Medline, EMBASE, Ageline, CINAHL, HealthSource- Nursing/Academic Edition, AMED and Psych INFO databases were searched. Three main concepts were explored and linked using Boolean operators; older people, falls and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> The search was updated until February 2016 with no new articles found. After removal of duplicates, 562 articles were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria resulting in six studies for the meta-synthesis. These studies were critically appraised using the McMaster critical appraisal tool. Bespoke data extraction sheets were developed and a meta-synthesis approach was adopted to extract and synthesise findings. Three themes of 'a mix of attitudes', 'careful deliberations' and 'a source of anxiety' were established. Perspectives of older people were on a continuum between regarding <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> as necessary and not necessary. Levels of engagement with the <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> process seemed associated with acceptance of their risk of falling and their familiarity with available <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> strategies. Avoiding a long lie on the floor following a fall is imperative for older people in the community but {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for falls.
