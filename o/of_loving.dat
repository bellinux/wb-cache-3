The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong.

5|$|Thirty Flights <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} developed by Brendon Chung's indie video game studio, Blendo Games. It {{was released in}} August 2012 for Microsoft Windows, and in November 2012 for OS X. The game employs {{a modified version of}} id Software's 1997-era id Tech 2 engine—originally used for Quake 2—and incorporates music composed by Idle Thumbs member Chris Remo. It follows three people as they prepare for an alcohol heist and the aftermath of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that {{is estimated to}} take about 15 minutes on average to complete. Using the WASD keys and mouse, the player controls the main character, an unnamed spy who participates in an alcohol-smuggling operation. The player works alongside non-playable characters Anita, a demolitions expert, and Borges, a forger. The game follows the group as they prepare for a heist and experience its aftermath. The robbery is omitted from the game, although it is revealed that it went wrong.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E

5|$|Peggy {{demands that}} Stacey leave the pub and Stacey pleads with {{her not to}} call the police for Lily's sake. She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy <b>of</b> <b>loving</b> the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act <b>of</b> <b>loving</b> God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, {{also known}} as C.C.D. {{consists}} {{of men and women}} whose mission is to teach the principles <b>of</b> <b>loving</b> and serving God to the children of the parish who do not attend Catholic School. Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). These teachers send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to help the children grow in their faith. The majority of children who attend one of the Sunday Schools are ages 6–12.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking <b>of</b> <b>loving</b> through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> v. Virginia (1967).|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> {{begins with}} the player walking through a small {{corridor}} where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot {{in a room full}} of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E

25|$|Caroline's album format meant that, {{although}} the station served {{a gap in}} the market, its audience was smaller than in the 1960s. Caroline also promoted O'Rahilly's concept <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> Awareness (LA), a far-eastern philosophy of love and peace. Some DJs were embarrassed but some were fascinated by the challenge of an abstract concept. Disc jockey Tony Allan developed a following, combining Loving Awareness with a professional style, humanity, knowledge of music and rich radio voice.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, Representative Andrew King (Democrat of Missouri) was {{the first}} {{politician}} in Congress to propose {{a constitutional amendment to}} make interracial marriage illegal nationwide. King proposed this amendment because he predicted (correctly, as the case <b>of</b> <b>Loving</b> v. Virginia later demonstrated) that the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868 to give equal civil rights to the emancipated ex-slaves (the Freedmen) as {{part of the process of}} Reconstruction, would render laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional.|$|E

40|$|The skripsi, {{entitled}} “Kekuatan Cinta yang Tercermin dalam Cerita Pendek “Brokeback Mountain” dan “A Type <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> Story””, aims at {{identifying and}} analyzing the power <b>of</b> <b>love</b> reflected {{through the main}} character. The data were collected {{by focusing on the}} characters, setting and plot as the elements of prose which reveal the power <b>of</b> <b>love</b> in the short stories “Brokeback Mountain” and “A Type <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> Story”. In analyzing the character, the writer used the theory of Roberts concerning the character as the representation of human being. The writer also used Stenberg 2 ̆ 7 s idea to identify the power <b>of</b> <b>love</b> in the whole sequence of the story. The findings of this research show that these two literary works reflect the power <b>of</b> <b>love</b> portrayed by the intrinsic elements such as character, setting, and plot of the short stories. Both of these short stories have similarities and differences in terms of the power <b>of</b> <b>love.</b> The similarities lie first, in the beginning <b>of</b> <b>love</b> that starts from mere lust; second, at the end <b>of</b> <b>love</b> that ends in failure; and third, in the hidden <b>love</b> relation <b>of</b> the characters. The differences lie in the characters, perspectives <b>of</b> <b>love</b> and in the type <b>of</b> <b>love</b> they experience...|$|R
