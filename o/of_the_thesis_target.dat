Many artists do not only work with plastic waste but their ideals and methodologies are intimately related with a strong personal commitment in the environmental field. How can they produce new ways to acknowledge phenomena like <b>the</b> plastic pollution <b>of</b> oceans and <b>the</b> hazards it produces to our environment ? This Master of Arts thesis will endeavor to highlight the critical rethinking that contemporary artists are calling for, for this specific aspect of our consumer’s society and the consequences it entails on our future life.

As a promising education form, it has attracted lots of attentions from institutions, learners and employers. However, the effectiveness and fairness of MOOC have been encroaching by academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is defined as using dishonest means to gain an undeserved reward or {{to get rid of}} an embarrassing situation in relation to an academic exercise. It is a widespread occurrence in different levels of education and various education forms. In this thesis, we focus on a cheating strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online (CAMEO), in MOOCs. The strategy involves learners who use fake accounts for harvesting solutions that they later submit in different accounts. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> user logs, we identify potential CAMEO users in 10 MOOCs provided by Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) on edX with three different detection methods. Besides, we analyze <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detected users. Our results reveal that among the 8171 certificates issued in the 10 MOOCs, an estimated 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> certificates are earned by CAMEO users. We find that the CAMEO users are more likely to cheat at <b>the</b> midterm <b>of</b> a MOOC than <b>the</b> other periods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course. The research makes contributions to understanding <b>the</b> popularity <b>of</b> cheating especially CAMEO in MOOCs and getting <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> cheaters’ behaviors preferences in MOOCs.

40|$|Dogs are {{commonly}} referred to as man's best friend, but <b>the</b> main focus <b>of</b> this thesis was to investigate how the dog experiences the relationship. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> dealt with methodology currently used to assess the dog-human relationship: the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) and the Monash Dog Owner Relationship Scale (MDORS). In one experiment, possible associations between the dog's bond to its owner (using the SSP) and <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owner's relationship to the dog (using the MDORS) were investigated. Associations found were linked to how much the owner interacted with the dog on a daily basis, but not to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owner's emotional closeness to the dog. In another experiment, the SSP was evaluated for its suitability to measure a dog's bond to a human. Findings showed that the test procedure was sensitive to order effects, but that there was variation in how the dog behaved during reunion with the person. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>the</b> dog's reaction upon reunion with a human in different situations. In one study, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> time being separated from the owner was studied in the dog's home. While the owner was away dogs rested for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> time alone. But once the owner returned, dogs initiated more physical contact and expressed higher frequencies of lip licking, body shaking and tail wagging after a longer duration of separation compared to a shorter one. In the final study, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> interaction initiated by the human upon reunion was manipulated and endocrine measures were taken to better interpret the dog's behavioural reaction. It was found that when the person initiated both physical and verbal ('full') contact with the dog, oxytocin levels increased and stayed high for a longer time after the reunion event compared to when the person only talked to the dog or ignored it. <b>The</b> levels <b>of</b> physical contact initiated by the dog and lip licking behaviour were highest when the person interacted fully with the dog. In summary, at reunion the dog's greeting behaviour differed according to <b>the</b> familiarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person, to <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separation and to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> interaction initiated by the person. It is proposed that this variation in dog behaviour during reunion should be <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> future studies of dog-human relationships. ...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, gas explosions inside pipes are considered. Laboratory {{experiments}} and numerical simulations are <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thesis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work {{was to develop}} numerical models that could predict accidental gas explosions inside pipes. Experiments were performed in circular steel pipes, with an inner diameter of 22. 3 mm, and a plexiglass pipe, with an inner diameter of 40 mm. Propane, acetylene and hydrogen at various equivalence ratios in air were used. Pressure was recorded by Kistler pressure transducers and flame propagation was captured by photodiodes, a SLR camera and a high-speed camera. The experiments showed that acoustic oscillations would occur in the pipes, and that <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> these oscillations {{are determined by the}} pipe length. Several inversions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame front can occur during the flame propagation in a pipe. These inversions are appearing due to quenching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame front at the pipe wall and due to interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame front with the longitudinal pressure waves in the pipe. Transition to detonation was achieved in acetylene-air mixtures in a 5 m steel pipe with 4 small obstructions. Simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame propagation in smooth pipes were performed with an 1 D MATLAB version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Random Choice Method (RCMLAB). Methods for estimation of quasi 1 D burning velocities and of pipe outlet conditions from experimental pressure data were implemented into this code. The simulated pressure waves and flame propagation were compared to the experimental results and there are good agreements between the results. Simulations were also performed with the commercial CFD code FLACS. They indicated that to properly handle the longitudinal pressure oscillations in pipes, at least 7 grid cells in each direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe cross-section and a Courant number of maximum 1 should be used.

Firstly, {{the interaction between}} folic acid and tea as well as tea catechins was studied in vitro, using Caco- 2 cell monolayers and secondly, a clinical trial was designed and carried out. In addition, targeting of folic acid conjugated nanoparticles to FR expressing Caco- 2 cells was studied in order to evaluate <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> nutrient-receptor-coupled transport for drug targeting. In <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> this work, it was shown that EGCG and ECG (gallated catechins) inhibit folic acid uptake (IC 50 of 34. 8 and 30. 8 µmol/L) comparable to MTX (methotrexate) under these experimental conditions. Moreover, commercial green and black tea extracts inhibited folic acid uptake with IC 50 values of approximately 7. 5 and 3. 6 mg/mL, respectively. These results clearly indicate an interaction between folic acid and green tea catechins at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> intestinal uptake. <b>The</b> mechanism responsible for the inhibition process might be <b>the</b> inhibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influx transport routes for folates such as via RFC and/or PCFT. For understanding the in vivo relevance of this in vitro interaction, a phase one, open-labeled, randomized, cross-over clinical study in seven healthy volunteers was designed. For the 0. 4 mg folic acid dose, the mean Cmax decreased by 39. 2 % and 38. 6 % and the mean AUC 0  decreased by 26. 6 % and 17. 9 % by green tea and black tea, respectively. For the 5 mg folic acid dose, the mean Cmax decreased by 27. 4 % and mean AUC 0  decreased by 39. 9 % when taken with green tea. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical study confirm the interaction between tea and folic acid in vivo leading to lower bioavailabilities of folic acid. In <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>targeting</b> studies using folic acid conjugated nanoparticles were conducted. Folic acid conjugated nanoparticles were shown to be internalized by the cell via FR (folate receptor) mediated endocytosis. DNA block copolymer micelles equipped with 2, 11 and 28 folic acid units respectively were applied on FR expressing Caco- 2 cells. There was a direct proportion in <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> internalized nanoparticle and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> folic acid units on <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nanoparticle. To sum up, throughout this <b>thesis,</b> <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> folic acid for nutrition and nutrient and drug related {{interactions of}} folic acid at intestinal level was shown. Furthermore, significance of FRs in targeting for cancer chemotherapy was demonstrated in in vitro cell culture experiments. Folic acid conjugated DNA block copolymer micelles were suggested as efficient nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery...|$|R
40|$|The theory {{community}} {{has worked on}} Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) {{for more than two}} decades, and has produced many protocols for many settings. One common thread in these works is that the protocols cannot use a Trusted Third Party (TTP), even though this is conceptually the simplest and most general solution. Thus, current protocols involve only the direct players—we call such protocols self-reliant. They often use blinded boolean circuits, which has several sources of overhead, some due to the circuit representation and some due to the blinding. However, secure coprocessors like the IBM 4758 have actual security properties similar to ideal TTPs. They also have little RAM and a slow CPU. We call such devices Tiny TTPs. <b>The</b> availability <b>of</b> real tiny TTPs opens the door for a different approach to SMC problems. One major challenge with this approach is how to execute large programs on large inputs using the small protected memory of a tiny TTP, while preserving the trust properties that an ideal TTP provides. In this thesis we have investigated <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> real TTPs to help with <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> SMC problems. We start with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> such TTPs to solve the Private Information Retrieval (PIR) problem, which is one important instance of SMC.

40|$|This thesis explores a {{previously}} unrecognized theme within <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> John. <b>The</b> theme is violence and its expression through <b>the</b> victimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative's protagonist, Jesus. It {{suggests that he}} is presented as being, as well as perceiving himself to be, a victim. This offers an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine Jesus which counters <b>the</b> traditional model <b>of</b> a serene and omniscient figure who exercises sovereign control over his environment. The first section aims to situate the research methodologically, theologically and historically. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presuppositions underlying the study are best understood in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> liberation theology, {{and the way in}} which a liberator is seen to function within an oppressed community. Drawing on theories about <b>the</b> historical origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel, reasons why victimization might be expected to be a prominent theme in John are also suggested. <b>The</b> main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> comprises <b>targeted</b> exegesis <b>of</b> passages which reveal Jesus experiencing violence and manifesting <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> a victim. This section is subdivided into six chapters which work their way chronologically through the narrative. The first two explore the public ministry from different perspectives - physical and psychological - with the latter discussing <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Jesus with insights afforded by <b>the</b> discipline <b>of</b> victimology. Subsequent chapters discuss the way in which Jesus approaches and encounters his death. In particular, <b>the</b> traditional picture <b>of</b> Jesus as <b>the</b> `glorious victor' on the cross is impugned; and figures from the Hebrew Bible are employed as hermeneutical tools for recognizing him as a victim. The final chapter discusses the difference in behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resurrected Jesus. It concludes that, freed from <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> `the hour', he no longer perceives himself to be a victim. This enables him to attend to <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> his disciples, empowering them to overcome areas of oppression in their own lives...|$|R
