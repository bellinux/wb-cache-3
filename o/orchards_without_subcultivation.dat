40|$|The {{localization}} {{of a cell}} type-specific, soluble fibroblast {{surface antigen}} (SFA) was studied by immunofluorescence and by scanning electron microscopy of the same cells. The antigen had an uneven distribution forming streaks on chick embryo fibroblasts. It was localized to membrane processes and ridges, with a diameter of 50 – 200 nm. The processes extended from {{the periphery of the}} cells to the substratum or to other cells. Trypsin treatment completely removed detectable amounts of SFA. The antigen was detectable within 1 h after trypsin-treated cells were reseeded. The reappearance of SFA correlated with the restoration of membrane processes. Fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) showed loss of all or most SFA. When normal cells were transformed <b>without</b> <b>subcultivation</b> and trypsinization a fibrillar extracellular network of SFA remained under the transformed fibroblasts while the cells themselves were negative in immunofluorescence. When fibroblasts infected by RSV mutants were transferred to nonpermissive temperature for transformation new SFA was detected within 2 h. These data lead us to propose that loss of stabilizing and anchoring effect of SFA molecules in fibrillar cell surface structures may be critical in altered growth control and malignant transformation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} the refactoring of an agricultural vehicle localization {{system and its}} deployment and field-testing in apple orchards. The system enables affordable precision agriculture in tree fruit production by providing the vehicle’s position in the <b>orchard</b> <b>without</b> the use of expensive differential GPS. The localization methodology depends only on the wheel and steering encoders and the laser rangefinder already on the vehicle for row following, thus adding zero hardware cost to the overall setup. It employs an Extended Kalman Filter to integrate {{the information from the}} sensors, with the pose being predicted via encoder odometry and updated via point and line features detections. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the complete refactoring of the initial proof-of-concept localization system, with the goal of making it robust, modular and reusable.

40|$|Póster presentado en el Xylem International Meeting, 7 - 9 September 2015, Bordeaux, France. Regulated deficit {{irrigation}} (RDI) {{is widely}} recommended for high density olive orchards. However, plants under this irrigation strategy {{are exposed to}} sudden and marked changes in soil water status. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of RDI on main xylem anatomical traits of olive trees and to assess their influence in the plant water status and gas exchange. We worked with trees in a super high density `Arbequina¿ olive orchard, under both full irrigation (FI) and a RDI treatment supplying ca. 45 % of the water applied to the FI trees. Marked differences between treatments both in water status and gas exchange were found in periods when irrigation was reduced for the RDI trees. Despite of the differences on water status, xylem vessel density, xylem vessel diameter distribution and theoretical specific conductivity, were not influence by the irrigation treatments. This agrees with the high adaptation of the olive tree to drought. In summary, our results suggest that RDI {{can be used in}} olive <b>orchards</b> <b>without</b> causing permanent hydraulic limitation in the plants. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) enable numerous agricultural applications such as terrain mapping, monitor crop growth, detecting areas with diseases and so on. For these applications a UAV flies above the terrain and has a global view of the plants. When the individual fruits or plants have to be examined, an oblique view is better, e. g. via an inspection-camera mounted on expensive all-terrain wheeled robots that drive through the orchard. However, {{in this paper we}} aim to autonomously navigate through the orchard with a low-cost UAV and cheap sensors (e. g. a webcam). Evidently, this is challenging since every orchard or even every corridor looks different. For this we developed a vision-based system that detects the center and end of the corridor to autonomously navigate the UAV {{towards the end of the}} <b>orchard</b> <b>without</b> colliding with the trees. Furthermore extensive experiments were performed to prove that our algorithm is able to navigate through the orchard with high accuracy and in real-time, even on embedded hardware.

In orchards where D. thoracicus were present, 25 % fewer farmers sprayed insecticides than in <b>orchards</b> <b>without</b> D. thoracicus. Promoting greater farmers' acceptance of D. thoracicus may be difficult because 30 % of the farmers said that D. thoracicus increases mealybug populations.

The mealybug P. lilacinus was not affected, but Alophia sp. damage was significantly smaller in ant-abundant trees (P < 0. 01). In Tra Vinh, the use of high-pressure pumps to spray tree canopies with water hampered D. thoracicus and lessened Alophia sp. control.

The trials T 100 and T 50 (receiving a water amount equivalent to 100 % and 50 % of the required, respectively) and the control T 0 (rainfed trial) were monitored during two consecutive years. Results showed significant increase of equatorial diameter and flesh:pit ratio of irrigated drupes. The decrease of pH and the numbers of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) registered for the irrigated trials during the fermentation were more consistent than those displayed by control T 0. Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus coryniformis and Pediococcus pentosaceous for LAB, and Candida boidinii, Candida diddensiae and Wickerhamomyces anomalus for yeasts were isolated at highest concentrations.

40|$|Wild pollinators are {{becoming}} more valuable to global agriculture as the commercial honeybee industry is increasingly affected by disease and other stressors. Perennial tree crops are particularly reliant on insect pollination, and are often pollen limited. Research on how different tree crop production systems influence the richness and abundance of wild pollinators is, however, limited. We investigated, for the first time, the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators in commercial temperate almond orchards in Australia, and compared them to potential pollinator communities in proximate native vegetation. We quantified ground cover variables at each site and assessed the value of ground cover on the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators in commercial almond systems focussing on three common taxa: bees, wasps and flies. More insects were caught in orchards with living ground cover than in native vegetation or <b>orchards</b> <b>without</b> ground cover, although overall species richness was highest in native vegetation. Percent ground cover was positively associated with wasp richness and abundance, and native bee richness, but flies showed no association with ground cover. The strongest positive relationship was between native bee abundance and the richness of ground cover plants. Our results suggest that maintaining living ground cover within commercial almond orchards could provide habitat and resources for potential wild pollinators, particularly native bees.

Studies were conducted in 1971 to: (1) document the disappearance of 2, 4 -D from orchard soils; (2) analyze for 2, 4 -D residues in developing apple and pear fruits throughout the season; and (3) determine if 2, 4 -D, when properly applied to Red Delicious apple and Bartlett pear orchards, alters the ripening process of mature fruit. Applications of 2, 4 -D were made at 0, 2. 24, and 4. 48 kg/ha. Experimental sites were in apple and pear orchards in the upper and lower Hood River Valley near Hood River, Oregon.

Fruit set decreased from 100 % in vines nearest the central male to 17 % in 1988 and to only 7 % in 1989 in the most distant vines. Mean fruit weight for each vine decreased from 110 to 34 g in 1988 and from 113 to 37 g in 1989, fruit weight decreasing the further the vine was from the pollen source. As a consequence, yield progressively decreased from vines adjacent to the pollenizer (54. 9 and 58. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively) to those most distant (3. 7 and 1. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively).

Even within the tree rows different beneficial can {{be supported by}} selected plant species. In most experimental work done to stabilize the apple production system only single interaction effects were tested.

Our experiment combines all known measures of indirect pest and disease control measures in a near-to practical production model <b>orchard</b> <b>without</b> {{the use of any}} pesticide (not even organic ones). The orchard is split in 4 blocks: in two of them bio-control measures e. g. application of Granulosis Virus against codling moth (C.

In the self-regulating orchard they were capable to keep the aphid damages – in particular of the powdery apple aphid (D. plantaginea) - on trees and fruits under a commercially relevant level although the initial abundance of aphid colonies in spring was by far over the common threshold value.

40|$|This thesis explores how rural social {{enterprises}} (SEs) in England and Germany {{pursue their}} environmental objectives to conserve traditional orchards. Such valuable biospheres lose money, leading their owners {{to replace them}} with more profitable land uses. SEs in both countries strive to revive commercial incentives to maintain these cultural landscapes. Policy makers have invested high expectations in SE for tackling social exclusion and strengthening civic participation in the UK, and in relation to labour market reforms following German reunification. Academic interest {{in the social and}} commercial performance of SE is not matched by research into its environmental potentials. In England semi-structured interviews with 33 people examined SEs linked to estates of the National Trust. In Germany 18 people were interviewed within six social enterprises with varied structures including associative, co-operative or unlimited/limited liability. In all cases orchard products are sold to generate money to fund orchard conservation. Analysis was framed by the concepts of field theory and market co-ordination advocated by Jens Beckert. He argues that market actors must co-ordinate three ‘problems’ - value, competition and co-operation - to secure market stability. Observing reciprocal and dynamic relationships in the market ‘field’ between networks, institutions and cognition, reveals how markets are socially structured. The appropriation of Beckert’s theories aids SE study: firstly, the intervention of SEs clearly stimulates market dynamics; and secondly, SEs attempt to re-configure market stability in favour of improved environmental results. Analysis revealed that the National Trust’s efforts to market juice increases public engagement, but fails clearly to link juice sales and orchard conservation. The German networked market is a low-risk, low-turnover model that incentivises farmers to maintain <b>orchards</b> <b>without</b> changing market structures, thereby creating an alliance between market actors. Lastly, German market-building SEs use complex, risky operations to compete with conventional firms. Both German models produce positive environmental outcomes. Key challenges linked to using Beckert’s ideas are that market power is not sought by environmental SEs, which see profit as a means to an end, and that field theory is largely aspatial, and thus unable to fully explain local variations in the environmental performance of each model. Nevertheless, Beckert’s structure for observing market interventions offers potential for practitioners/policy makers concerned with multi-functional rural development...|$|R

The legumes overcame a false break observed in the third year recovering the dominance of the covers in the fourth growing season. This means that the seed bank established in previous seasons ensured the persistence of the sown legume even when a gap in seed production occurred. The early-maturing cultivars produced less biomass and fixed less N (approx. 50 kg N/ha/yr present in the above-ground biomass) than the late-maturing ones, but would compete less for water since the growing cycle finished earlier in the spring. They seem best suited to being grown in dry farmed olive orchards with low N demand in drought prone regions...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceThe precise {{management}} of <b>orchards</b> cannot do <b>without</b> {{the support of}} various orchard field data, and the orchard field data server is an effective solution thereto. The orchard field data server consists of data acquisition unit, data communication unit, data analysis unit and such diversified server sockets of user terminal as supportive personal computer (PC), notebook computer, mobile phone and telephone. The orchard workers can set data acquisition cycle according to the requirements, and the processed data can serve the orchard workers in many respects. After its promotion and application in many orchards in such regions as Liaoning and Beijing, the said system has been proved to be of easy use and reliable effect, so that the project has achieved good social, ecological and economic benefits...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in The Farmer, a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by F. Newman Turner, a writer and pioneering organic farmer. The magazine sponsored the establishment of the Producer Consumer Whole Food Society Ltd, with Newman Turner as president and Derek Randal as vice-president. Whole food was defined as [...] "mature produce of field, <b>orchard,</b> or garden <b>without</b> subtraction, addition, or alteration grown from seed without chemical dressing, in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes, and composts therefrom, and ground, raw rock and without chemical manures, sprays, or insecticides," [...] having intent to connect suppliers and the growing public demand for such food. Such diets are rich in whole and unrefined foods, like whole grains, dark green and yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds.|$|R
60|$|Some soils, like a rocky tract {{called the}} Easterbrooks Country in my neighborhood, are so {{suited to the}} apple, that it will grow faster in them without any care, or if only the ground is broken up once a year, than it will in many places with any amount of care. The owners of this tract allow that the soil is {{excellent}} for fruit, but they {{say that it is}} so rocky that they have not patience to plough it, and that, together with the distance, is the reason why it is not cultivated. There are, or were recently, extensive <b>orchards</b> there standing <b>without</b> order. Nay, they spring up wild and bear well there in the midst of pines, birches, maples, and oaks. I am often surprised to see rising amid these trees the rounded tops of apple-trees glowing with red or yellow fruit, in harmony with the autumnal tints of the forest.|$|R
40|$|Throughout history, {{humans have}} {{cyclically}} {{return to their}} old traditions such as the organic orchards. Nowadays, these have been integrated into the modern cities and could supply fresh vegetables to the daily food improving human health. Organic <b>orchards</b> grow crops <b>without</b> pesticides and artificial fertilizers thus, they are respectful with the environment and guarantee the food's safety. In modern society, the application of new technology is a must, in this case to obtain an efficient irrigation. In order to monitor a proper irrigation and save water and energy, soil water content probes are used to measure soil water content. Among them, capacitive probes,monitored with a specific data logger, are typically used. Most of them, specially the data loggers, are expensive {{and in many cases}} are not used. In this work, we have applied the open hardware Arduino to build and program a low cost datalogger for the programming of irrigation in an experimental organic orchard. Results showed that the application of such as low cost technology, which is easily available in the market and easy to understand, everyone can built and program its own device helping in managing water resources in organic orchards...|$|R
