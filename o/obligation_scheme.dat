2500|$|One of {{the major}} issues facing the Internet segment in India is the lower average {{bandwidth}} of broadband connections {{compared to that of}} developed countries. According to 2007 statistics, the average download speed in India hovered at about 40 KB per second (256 kbit/s), the minimum speed set by TRAI, whereas the international average was 5.6 Mbit/s during the same period. In order to attend this infrastructure issue the government declared 2007 as [...] "the year of broadband". To compete with international standards of defining broadband speed the Indian Government has taken the aggressive step of proposing a $13 billion national broadband network to connect all cities, towns and villages with a population of more than 500 in two phases targeted for completion by 2012 and 2013. The network was supposed to provide speeds up to 10 Mbit/s in 63 metropolitan areas and 4 Mbit/s in an additional 352 cities. Also, the Internet penetration rate in India is one of the lowest in the world and only accounts for 8.4% of the population compared to the rate in OECD counties, where the average is over 50%. Another issue is the digital divide where growth is biased in favour of urban areas; according to 2010 statistics, more than 75 per cent of the broadband connections in the country are in the top 30 cities. Regulators have tried to boost the growth of broadband in rural areas by promoting higher investment in rural infrastructure and establishing subsidised tariffs for rural subscribers under the Universal service <b>obligation</b> <b>scheme</b> of the Indian government.|$|E

However, {{despite the fact that}} such schemes have been successfully implemented and proven cost-effective in several Member States, not all countries are convinced of their potential benefits. In this paper, we investigate the policy instruments that Sweden has introduced or is planning to introduce for achieving increased industrial efficiency under the EED’s requirements. Our preliminary results show that these instruments are not exploiting the full potential of energy savings, especially in energy intensive industries. We present the design of an EEOS as an alternative policy instrument to alleviate some of the barriers to energy efficiency that the industries face today. The implications of the EED for industries in Sweden are evaluated together with the insights from EEOSs carried out in other Member States and the practices of industrial energy efficiency policies in Sweden. Finally, we identify possible pathways that could engage the industries in energy saving measures including the EEOS for removing non-economic and regulatory barriers to energy efficiency in the industrial sector.

The scenarios were constructed with the PREMIA biofuel model, which is based on a recursive year by year simulation of biofuel demand and supply until 2030. For each set of exogenously given parameters an equilibrium point is found at which the costs of biofuels equal those of the fossil alternative they substitute, taking into account the feedback loops of the agricultural market and restrictions in the annual growth rates of capacity. The model delivers detailed outcomes for the types of biofuels considered such as biodiesel or ethanol, first or second generation biofuels with regard to production capacity and produced volumes, costs and well-to-wheel emissions of greenhouse gases. The scenarios are used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of biofuel support policies, such as tax exemption or <b>obligation</b> <b>schemes.</b> All results are set into context with the experiences made with these policies in the different member states so far.

Solar Century argued they had a legitimate expectation from clear representations by government that the scheme would be open until 2017, the 2015 Order was ultra vires the Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, and it was unfair to specify a date in the past as one for identifying a significant financial commitment.|$|E

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the implementation}} of Article 7 and presents key findings on its application in Member States. It also recommends routes to improving the implementation {{and the application of}} the Directive. Member States have used exemptions and exclusions within the Directive to reduce their annual savings targets to approximately 0. 75 %, compared with the headline figure of 1. 5 %. The largest share of the overall savings is expected from Energy Efficiency <b>Obligation</b> <b>Schemes</b> (EEOS) (34 %), financing schemes or grants (19 %), and taxes (14 %). In total, 16 Member States now have or plan to introduce EEOS, but the several of the newer schemes are at risk of failing to deliver their expected savings. Overall, a significant share of the expected savings is at risk of not being delivered in practice because of potential non additionality; weak or absent monitoring and verification regimes; and methodological issues related to the calculation of energy savings from policy measures. However, there are several case study examples of good practice, and many opportunities for Member States to learn from each other. Policy reform would strengthen the Directive and increase the reliability of the anticipated energy savings. Improvements could include more detailed provisions, extensive guidance and mandatory reporting templates...|$|R

Solar heat offers key advantages over other renewable sources for meeting this demand through distributed, integrated systems. Solar heat is a mature sustainable energy technology capable of mass deployment. There is significant scope for increasing the installed solar heat capacity in Europe. Only a few European countries are close to reaching the EU target of 1 m 2 of solar-thermal installations per person.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of whether an energy efficiency <b>obligation</b> <b>scheme</b> would be cost-effective for the Swedish industrial sector. The basic guidelines of the scheme were constructed based on the characteristics proposed in the Energy Efficiency Directive and the previously implemented schemes in other EU Member States. In order to measure the cost effectiveness of the scheme for the industries, a Cost Benefit Analysis was performed. The {{results of the study}} show that the participation of the industries in an energy efficiency <b>obligation</b> <b>scheme</b> seems to be cost effective, and the Benefit to Cost Ratios of the analysis where ranging in numbers higher than one, showing that the benefits outweigh the costs. The scheme is in general more cost effective when scenarios assuming high policy intensity for the whole economy of the country are used as input for the calculation of the BCRs, which are also affected positively when higher fuel prices scenarios are adopted. The obligation should be placed upon the distributors, since the prices of energy distribution are administratively regulated. There is opportunity of financial benefits for the Swedish industries from agreements of energy savings delivery to the distributors {{in order for them to}} fulfill their obligation. These benefits will support the cost recovery of the investments for the energy savings measures. The possibility of certificate trading in the context of the scheme is another option that can create opportunities for financial gains and stimulate further the energy market. Basing the costs inputs from other EU Member States offers an insight on how these costs could be formed in the case of Sweden, but they cannot be taken as a complete calculation of the scheme’s financial effects. As a result, this study does not offer a final conclusion on the cost-effectiveness of the scheme; it rather serves as a means of support of the final conclusion regarding the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency obligation schemes for the Swedish industries...|$|E

As a result, there are now sixteen EU EEOS in existence or planned, compared with just six prior {{to the introduction of}} the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive. At the same time, the long-standing EEOS in Denmark and UK have faced challenges because of concerns over increasing costs. This paper considers the role of EEOS in current and future EU and national policy: can established EEOS continue to deliver significant savings; will new schemes meet their targets; and will EEOS have an important future role? This analysis builds on research for the EU Commission, IEA and European Parliament and an EU project (ENSPOL). Firstly, this paper sets out in more detail the place of EEOS in EU energy policy. Then the future of longer-established EEOS is explored, with case studies presented for the UK and Denmark. Recent and planned re-designs in these two countries are detailed, with analysis of the factors which led to changes in policy ambition. For new EEOS, key risks to delivery of savings are an over-ambitious delivery target and time line in the absence of policy learning opportunities. These risks can be mitigated by either having a preliminary or voluntary phase, or by adopting policy design from another country. The policy risk for nine EEOS is assessed, and the conclusion is that savings are at most risk in Croatia, Latvia and Spain. The paper concludes with an analysis of EEOS within the future policy mix. The discussion considers the place of EEOS in EU policy, future savings from EEOS, their relationship with energy companies and the possible influence of different framings of energy efficiency. Then thoughts about {{what it would take to}} not need EEOS as an option in the policy mix are presented, with concluding ideas about how to secure a strong and effective future for EEOS. </p...|$|R
