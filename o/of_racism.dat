5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media.

5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community.

5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall.

The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases <b>of</b> <b>racism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues <b>of</b> <b>racism</b> through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance.

The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the relationship <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism</b> to glucose intolerance in a population of Afro-Caribbean women aged 18 to 55. Also of interest was whether this relationship would be differentially influenced {{by the type of}} body fat distribution or confounded by the level of hostility. A total of 244 women were selected from a systematic sample of households on the island of Dominica, West Indies. Demographic data together with information on internalized racism were collected by questionnaire. Anthropometric information and fasting blood glucose were also measured. Women with high levels <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism</b> exhibited an increased risk of elevated fasting glucose compared to those with low levels <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism</b> (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 1 - 5. 5). There was no difference in mean body mass index (BMI) by level <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism.</b> However those with high internalized racism had a significantly larger waist circumference after adjusting for age, education, hostility, and elevated fasting glucose status. In multivariate analyses controlling for age, education, hostility, and either weight or BMI, internalized racism remained independently associated with elevated fasting glucose. However, once waist circumference was included in the model, the relationship <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism</b> to elevated fasting glucose was not statistically significant. This study demonstrates a significant relationship between internalized racism and abnormal levels of fasting glucose which may be mediated through abdominal fat. The exact nature of the relationship <b>of</b> internalized <b>racism</b> to glucose intolerance may be an important area of future study...|$|R

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study <b>of</b> <b>racism,</b> residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|The story {{starts out}} as a fairly {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as hints <b>of</b> <b>racism</b> and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
