40|$|When, in {{the early}} part of the year 1905, the {{management}} of the Southern Utah Experiment Farm was turned over to the officials of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, in compliance with an act of the legislature of that year a number of experiments were under way, principally variety tests with orchard and small fruit. The State Board of Horticulture had been in charge of this farm since its establishment in 1899, and had succeeded in making out of it not only a place that will indicate the varieties of fruits adapted to that climate and soil, but also a farm that in neatness and careful arrangement can be an instructive model to anyone contemplating engaging in that industry. The new management decided not to make any radical change in the tests that were under way, but to continue them to such a conclusion a will yield the valuable results that were to come out of them.

40|$|Reflective {{bands of}} Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper {{satellite}} imagery {{were used to}} facilitate the estimation of basal crop evapotranspiration (ETcb), or potential crop water use, in San Joaquin Valley fields during 2008. A ground-based digital camera measured green fractional cover (Fc) of 49 commercial fields planted to 18 different crop types (row crops, grains, <b>orchard,</b> <b>vineyard)</b> of varying maturity over 11 Landsat overpass dates. Landsat L 1 T terrain-corrected images were transformed to surface reflectance and converted to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). A strong linear relationship between NDVI and Fc was observed (r 2 = 0. 96, RMSE = 0. 062). The resulting regression equation was used to estimate Fc for crop cycles of broccoli, bellpepper, head lettuce, and garlic on nominal 7 – 9 day intervals for several study fields. Prior relationships developed by weighing lysimeter were used to transform Fc to fraction of reference evapotranspiration, also known as basal crop coefficient (Kcb). Measurements of grass reference evapotranspiration from the California Irrigation Management Information System were then used to calculate ETcb for each overpass date. Temporal profiles of Fc, Kcb, and ETcb were thus developed for the study fields, along with estimates of seasonal water use. Daily ETcb retrieval uncertainty resulting from error in satellite-based Fc estimation was < 0. 5 mm/d, with seasonal uncertainty of 6 – 10 %. Results were compared with FAO- 56 irrigation guidelines and prior lysimeter observations for reference...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{contribute}} to knowledge about potentials of traditional, evergreen oak woodland in Southern Portugal, Montado, for the recreational and leisure activities demanded by society. Study of this issue pretends to help in managing the alternative use of traditional cultural landscapes aiming in their maintenance. Up to now, {{little attention has been}} devoted to the evaluation of the Montado by users of the non production functions. In this study a qualitative research method based on the 232 individual face-to-face interviews with several user groups of rural areas (urban dwellers, rural inhabitants, tourists, hunters, mushroom pickers, beekeepers, and landowners) was applied. As the visual stimuli, seven color photos of main land uses in Southern Portugal were used: eucalyptus forest, stone pine forest, maritime pine forest, Montado, olive <b>orchard,</b> <b>vineyard</b> and irrigated agricultural crop system. The identification of land users ’ preferences was carried out by quantitative analysis and subsequently, the values of surveyed landscape type perceived by respondents were detected by content analysis. From seven landscape types, the Montado was the most preferred for 61 % of all respondents. The content analysis of explanations of preferences revealed several values assigned to the studied system. These were related with tradition and identity, restorative experiences, and with ecological, aesthetic and economic values. The results uncovered the enhanced potential of the Montado, within other land uses in the region, for the non production functions demanded by today’s society, which should be appropriately considered in its future management...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the role of}} land cover and land use change (LUC) as a soil ability to store carbon and reduce carbon dioxide emission in a Mediterranean area. Using a paired site approach we estimated the effect of land cover change on the carbon stock from 1972 to 2008 in a natural reserve (Grotta di S. Ninfa) in the West of Sicily. Fifteen paired sites representative of five land use change were selected. We studied the effect of land use on soil organic carbon (SOC) content in bulk soil and 2000 - 1000 µm, 1000 - 500 µm, 500 - 250 µm, 250 - 63 µm, 63 - 25 µm and < 25 µm size fractions. Furthermore, laboratory incubation of the soil samples was conducted to measure carbon dioxide evolution in bulk soil at two different depth from each paired site. Our {{results showed that the}} conversion of natural vegetation to <b>orchard</b> (<b>vineyard</b> and olive grove) resulted in SOC decrease from 27 % up to 50 %. The conversion from vineyard to arable land led to 9 % decrease, while the opposite caused a 105 % SOC gain. Finally when arable land is replaced by eucalyptus afforestation a 40 % SOC increasing was observed. SOC decline occurred mainly in coarser fractions, while the finest one are not influenced by land use. An overall reduction in the study area of 63 % of SOC was calculated, corresponding to a 58 Mg ha- 1 SOC loss in less than 30 years. Our results indicated that land use conversion, vegetation type and management practices, which control biogeochemical and physical soil properties, could help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and sequester SOC...|$|E
40|$|Background Exposure to {{pesticides}} {{has been}} suggested as {{a risk factor for}} childhood leukemia, but definitive evidence on this relation and the specific pesticides involved is still not clear. Objective We carried out a population-based case-control study in a Northern Italy community to assess the possible relation between passive exposure to agricultural pesticides and risk of acute childhood leukemia. Methods We assessed passive pesticide exposure of 111 childhood leukemia cases and 444 matched controls by determining density and type of agricultural land use within a 100 -m radius buffer around children's homes. We focused on four common crop types, arable, <b>orchard,</b> <b>vineyard</b> and vegetable, characterized by the use of specific pesticides that are potentially involved in childhood induced leukemia. The use of these pesticides was validated within the present study. We computed the odds ratios (OR) of the disease and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) according to type and density of crops around the children's homes, also taking into account traffic pollution and high-voltage power line magnetic field exposure. Results Childhood leukemia risk did not increase in relation with any of the crop types with the exception of arable crops, characterized by the use of 2. 4 -D, MCPA, glyphosate, dicamba, triazine and cypermethrin. The very few children (n =  11) residing close to arable crops had an OR for childhood leukemia of 2. 04 (95 % CI 0. 50 – 8. 35), and such excess risk was further enhanced among children aged < 5 years. Conclusions Despite the null association with most crop types and the statistical imprecision of the estimates, the increased leukemia risk among children residing close to arable crops indicates the need to further investigate the involvement in disease etiology of passive exposure to herbicides and pyrethroids, though such exposure is unlikely {{to play a role in}} the vast majority of cases...|$|E

40|$|Terrestrial plant carbon {{partitioning}} to above- and below-ground compartments can {{be better}} understood by integrating studies on biomass allocation and estimates of root carbon input based {{on the use of}} stable isotopes. These experiments are essential to model ecosystem's metabolism and predict the effects of global change on carbon cycling. Using in-growth soil cores in conjunction with the 13 C natural abundance method we quantified net plant-derived root carbon input into the soil, which has been pointed out as the main unaccounted NPP (net primary productivity) component. Four land use types located in the Trentino Region (northern Italy) and representing a range of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) values (155 - 868 gC m- 2 y- 1) were investigated: conifer forest, apple <b>orchard,</b> <b>vineyard</b> and grassland. Cores, filled with soil of a known C 4 isotopic signature were inserted at 18 sampling points for each site and left in place for twelve months. After extraction, cores were analysed for %C and d 13 C, which were used to calculate the proportion of new plant-derived root C input by applying a mass balance equation. The GPP (gross primary productivity) of each ecosystem was determined by the eddy covariance technique whereas ANPP was quantified with a repeated inventory approach. We found a strong and significant relationship (R 2 = 0. 93; p= 0. 03) between ANPP and the fraction of GPP transferred to the soil as root C input across the investigated sites. This percentage varied between 10 and 25 % of GPP with the grassland having the lowest value and the apple orchard the highest. Mechanistic ecosystem carbon balance models could benefit from this general relationship since ANPP is routinely and easily measured at many sites. This result also suggests that by quantifying site-specific ANPP, root carbon input can be reliably estimated, as opposed to using arbitrary root/shoot ratios which may under- or over-estimate C partitionin...|$|E
40|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1995 reveals farmworkers are generally content with their jobs. Seasonal and year-round workers in <b>orchard,</b> <b>vineyard,</b> vegetable, agronomic, dairy and livestock {{operations in the}} Northern San Joaquin Valley were interviewed. Workers were generally complimentary to both supervisors and farm employers. One worker summed it up best, when {{he explained that he}} loved the job but it would be perfect if it paid better. An important implica-tion is that workers may not nec-essarily be looking for work out-side of agriculture. The 265 survey participants did, however, suggest numerous changes that supervisors and farm employers can make to improve the working conditions of agricultural labor-ers. Their suggestions included treating workers with more re-spect, constructive criticism of job performance, reasonable work pace and complete job instructions. Traditionally, agricultural work has not been held in high regard by the general population. It has been viewed as unpleasant, and an undesirable way to earn a living. Farm workers, how-ever, do not generally share this nega-tive view of farm work. For the most part, they appreciate the work and re-spect their employers. But their work-ing environment could be improved in ways that would benefit both employ-ees and employers. Many people view farm work as hard, unrewarding work; necessary, but unsatisfactory. This opinion is supported by the popular press, which often seems to speak disparagingly of farm work, such as in the award-win-ning series, ”Fields of Pain ” (Wagner and Breton 1991) that appeared in The Sacramento Bee newspaper. In addition, some think farmworkers share that opinion. However, this study con-ducted in 1995 in the Northern San Joaquin Valley reveals a more accurate picture of how farmworkers feel about their work. We interviewed 265 sea-sonal and year-round workers in or-chard, vineyard, vegetable, agronomic, dairy and livestock operations, and asked a number of questions to deter-mine their true feelings and percep-tions about their work. This is the third part in a series of findings on workers ’ feelings and pref-erences. In earlier California Agricultiire reports, we focused on workers ’ feel-ings about pay method (piece rate ver-sus hourly) and employer preference (grower versus farm labor contractor...|$|E
