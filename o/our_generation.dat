500|$|Ali Abu Nuwar {{was born}} in 1925 in al-Salt, Transjordan, which was then under British control. His father's family, the Abu Nuwar, was a {{prominent}} Arab clan in al-Salt.

During the closing years of World War I, the Ottomans had been driven out of their Arab territories by an alliance of Hashemite-led Arab rebels and British forces, and were thereafter replaced by the British and French, who effectively occupied the Arab territories. Revolts and popular opposition against European rule in Palestine, Transjordan and elsewhere in the region emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. In his memoirs, Abu Nuwar recalled that his teachers in al-Salt would tell him and his classmates that the [...] "Arab Nation was colonized and fragmented and that it was on the shoulders of <b>our</b> <b>generation</b> to take responsibility for freedom and unity".|$|E

Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play [...] "Alright" [...] in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, [...] "We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense." [...] Around the time of its release Coombes said that [...] "it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for <b>our</b> <b>generation.</b> The stuff about We are young/We run green... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms." [...] Danny Goffey noted, [...] "It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe. It was written in a cottage where the heating had packed up and we were trying to build fires to keep warm." ...|$|E
500|$|Today, Crane is {{considered}} one of the most innovative writers of the 1890s. His peers, including Conrad and James, as well as later writers such as Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and Willa Cather, hailed Crane as one of the finest creative spirits of his time. [...] His work was described by Wells as [...] "the first expression of the opening mind of a new period, or, at least, the early emphatic phase of a new initiative." [...] Wells said that [...] "beyond dispute", Crane was [...] "the best writer of <b>our</b> <b>generation,</b> and his untimely death was an irreparable loss to our literature." [...] Conrad wrote that Crane was an [...] "artist" [...] and [...] "a seer with a gift for rendering the significant on the surface of things and with an incomparable insight into primitive emotions". [...] Crane's work has proved inspirational for future writers; not only have scholars drawn similarities between Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and The Red Badge of Courage, but Crane's fiction is thought to have been an important inspiration for Hemingway and his fellow Modernists. [...] In 1936, Hemingway wrote in The Green Hills of Africa that [...] "The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. [...] That's not the order they're good in. [...] There is no order for good writers." [...] Crane's poetry is thought to have been a precursor to the Imagist movement, and his short fiction has also influenced American literature. [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "The Blue Hotel", The Monster and [...] "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" [...] are generally considered by critics to be examples of Crane's best work.|$|E

500|$|The pilot {{received}} favorable reviews {{upon its}} release. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{thought it was}} a [...] "respectful addition to Superman lore" [...] and had [...] "all the markings of a super series". Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, [...] "Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" [...] Echoing Owen, DVD Verdict noted the same symbolism: Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for <b>our</b> <b>generation.</b> The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role. Elizabeth White of Media Life believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot—Tuesdays at 9:00 p.m. (EST)—but also the audience's expectations of [...] "what Superman should be". USA Todays Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, [...] "For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about Smallville... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in Smallville. Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice." [...] Jeremy Conrad, from IGN, swore to himself that he would never watch Smallville, because he was a [...] "huge Superman fan" [...] and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, [...] "It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while." [...] In The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, [...] "Smallville opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time showing us the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent." ...|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of <b>our</b> <b>generation</b> has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E
