40|$|The {{spectral}} properties from 0. 4 to 3 microns of montmorillonite plus dark carbon grains (called <b>opaques)</b> {{of various}} sizes are studied {{as a function of}} the weight fraction of <b>opaques</b> present. The reflectance level and band depths of the 1. 4 -, 1. 9 -, 2. 2 -, and 2. 8 -micron water and/or OH absorption features are analyzed using derived empirical relationships and scattering theory. It is found that the absorption band depths and reflectance level are a very nonlinear function of the weight fraction of <b>opaques</b> present but can be predicted in many cases by simple scattering theory. The 2. 8 -micron bound water fundamental band is the most difficult absorption feature to suppress. The overtone absorptions are suppressed a greater amount than the fundamental but are still apparent even when 10 - 20 wt pct <b>opaques</b> are present. The relationships observed and the simple scattering theory presented show that quantitative compositional remote sensing studies are feasible for surfaces containing complex mineral mixtures...|$|R

Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists' pigments. The use of zinc white (zinc oxide) as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century. It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Böcklin, Van Gogh, Manet, Munch and others. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup (CI 77947).|$|E

40|$|ABST~CT: Heavy-mineral assemblages {{from the}} rivers and wadis in the River Nile {{drainage}} basin reflect their origins in three petrologi-cally and teetonically distinct source terranes that supply sediment o the River Nile and delta. The White Nile carries heavy-mineral assem-blages dominated by calcic amphibole, epidote, garnet, staurolite, al-uminosilicates, and <b>opaques</b> (ilmenite and titanomagnetite) derived from amphibolite- and granulite-grade metamorphic rocks of the Cen-tral African Province. The Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers carry assem-blages dominated by calcic amphibole, dinopyroxene, and <b>opaques</b> de-rived from alkali and tholeiitic basalts of the Ethiopian Highlands. Wadis (dry river beds) draining the Red Sea Hills contribute predom-inantly clinopyroxene, epidote, calcie amphibole, and <b>opaques</b> eroded from ophiolitc complexes, calc-alkaline volcanics, and granitoids as well as minor metamorphic minerals from amphibolite-grade meta-pelites.

5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere.

5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in high-temperature applications. This material is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack. Because of these properties, zircon finds many applications, few {{of which are}} highly publicized. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, <b>opaque</b> appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals.|$|E

40|$|The Cananeia {{alkaline}} {{occurrence of}} Late Cretaceous age (Ar-Ar, 83. 6 Ma) {{lies in the}} Ribeira Valley and it is representedby two small bodies: Morro de São João (1. 8 km 2) in Cananeia Island, and Morrete (0. 4 km 2), in the neighboringComprida Island. It is covered by Quaternary sediments and mostly constituted by intrusive rocks of syenitic composition,assembled into two principal groups: alkali feldspar syenites and quartz-alkali feldspar syenites. Microsyenites of variabletexture are subordinate. Regarding the mineralogy, the rocks are very rich in feldspars, mesoperthite being the most abundantphase, and plagioclase is only occasionally found as isolated crystals. Mafi c minerals consist dominantly of clinopyroxenesand amphiboles, both belonging to the calcic, calcic-sodic and sodic groups and showing signifi cant chemicalvariations, such as {{the increase in the}} Fe/Mg ratio and Na content, and the decrease in Ca, {{as a function of the}} degree ofevolution of the rocks. Textural relationships show that clinopyroxene reacts to form amphibole. Biotite is common, mainlyin association with amphibole and <b>opaques.</b> Biotite and <b>opaques</b> together are found at the borders of amphibole grainsor concentrated along their fractures and cleavage planes. Fayalitic olivine is rarely preserved. Most common accessoriesinclude <b>opaques,</b> mainly magnetite with exsolved ilmenite lamellae, apatite, titanite and zircon.

Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense <b>opaque</b> atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new {{information from the}} Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an <b>opaque</b> gum-like skin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more <b>opaque</b> due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine.

Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into <b>opaque</b> and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACt: Rapid erosion has {{occurred}} on the beaches of the Nile Delta in response to dam construction that has cut offthe river sediment supply. This erosion is greatest adjacent to the two distributary mouths, with shoreline retreat rates up to 60 m per year. The eroded sand is carried alongshore away from the river mouths, and deposited in areas of shoreline accretion. These patterns of shoreline rosion and deposition {{are reflected in the}} mineralogy of the beach sands. On a delta-wide scale, high-density <b>opaques,</b> garnet and zircon are concentrated in the erosion areas to form black-sand placers. Lower-density hornblende, as well as quartz and feldspars, are preferentially transported out of the erosion areas and deposited in the stretches of accreting shoreline. A detailed analysis of these sorting patterns has been undertaken with beach samples from Abu Quir Bay at the western end of the delta. Concentrations of <b>opaques,</b> zircon, futile and garnet decrease xponentially with longshore distance from the river mouth, while augite and hornblende increase xponentially. The coefficients in the exponential equations are found to be a function of mineral density, demonstrating the importance of this grain property in mineral sorting leading to the observed compositional variations along the shores of the Nile Delta...|$|R
