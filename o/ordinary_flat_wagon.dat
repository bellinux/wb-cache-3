50|$|The Finnish {{loading gauge}} allows the {{operation}} of freight vehicles considerably larger than most other railways in the European Union. Road trailers (often of VR's subsidiary Transpoint) can be easily accommodated on <b>ordinary</b> <b>flat</b> <b>wagons.</b> Much of the freight on the VR network is carried from Russia in Russian wagons, including large capacity eight-axle oil tank wagons.|$|R
50|$|One {{method of}} {{achieving}} interoperability between rolling stock of different gauges is to piggyback stock of one gauge on special transporter <b>wagons</b> or even <b>ordinary</b> <b>flat</b> <b>wagons</b> fitted with rails. This enables rolling stock to reach workshops and other {{lines of the}} same gauge {{to which they are}} not otherwise connected. Piggyback operation by the trainload occurred as a temporary measure between Port Augusta and Marree during gauge conversion work in the 1950s to bypass steep gradients and washaways in the Flinders Ranges.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>wagons</b> (sometimes <b>flat</b> beds, flats or rail flats, US: flatcars), as {{classified}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC), are railway goods wagons {{that have a}} flat, usually full-length, deck (or 2 decks on car transporters) and little or no superstructure. By contrast, open wagons have high side and end walls and covered goods wagons have a fixed roof and sides. <b>Flat</b> <b>wagons</b> are often designed for the transportation of goods that are not weather-sensitive. Some <b>flat</b> <b>wagons</b> are able to be covered completely by tarpaulins or hoods and are therefore suitable for the transport of weather-sensitive goods. Unlike a [...] "goods wagon with opening roof", the loading area of a flat is entirely open and accessible once the cover is removed.|$|R
