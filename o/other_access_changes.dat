50|$|Several {{computer}} processes or threads may {{access the}} same database concurrently. Several read accesses can be satisfied in parallel. A write access {{can only be}} satisfied if no <b>other</b> <b>accesses</b> are currently being serviced. Otherwise, the write access fails with an error code (or can automatically be retried until a configurable timeout expires). This concurrent <b>access</b> situation would <b>change</b> when dealing with temporary tables. This restriction is relaxed in version 3.7 when write-ahead logging (WAL) is turned on enabling concurrent reads and writes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDistributed Collaborative Editors (DCE) provide {{computer}} {{support for}} modifying simultaneously shared documents, such as articles, wiki pages and programming source code, by dispersed users. Controlling access in such systems {{is still a}} challenging problem, as they need dynamic <b>access</b> <b>changes</b> and low latency access to shared documents. In this paper, we propose a flexible access control model where the shared document and its authorization policy are replicated at the local memory of each user. To deal with latency and dynamic <b>access</b> <b>changes,</b> we use an optimistic access control technique {{in such a way}} that enforcement of authorizations is retroactive. We show that naive coordination between updates of both copies can create security holes on the shared document, by permitting illegal modifications or rejecting legal modifications. Finally, we present a prototype for managing authorizations in collaborative editing work which may be deployed easily on P 2 P networks...|$|R
