The law code of Alfred the Great, from the end of the ninth century, was also written in the vernacular, and he expected his ealdormen to learn it. His code was strongly influenced by Carolingian law going back to Charlemagne in such areas as treason, peace-keeping, organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal.

Greg Burrod, {{executive}} producer on Battlefront stated [...] "We {{wanted to create}} an online shooter title for the Xbox, PS2, and PC which would allow for team strategy and would feature battles and worlds from {{every one of the}} six Star Wars films." [...] Models and animations for the game were created in Softimage XSI, a 3D development application. Most characters used a common animation set and the minimal number of bones were used due to concerns with hardware limitations at that time. World environments were created with the developer's proprietary editor, ZeroEditor. The terrain-based landscape was formed using the editor's brushes to adjust height, texture application, and color shading. 3D models were then laid <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> along with general objective pathing for the artificial intelligence (AI). The AI used two main systems, again to ensure a minimal load on the hardware. A higher, overall objective, such as which command post to head towards, would only be calculated every few seconds per unit. Lower level objectives such as which enemy to fire on or what defensive strategy to take against incoming fire, are calculated continuously.|$|E

2500|$|New York City is {{believed}} to have created America's first slum, named the Five Points in 1825, as it evolved into a large urban settlement. Five Points was named for a lake named Collect. which, by the late 1700s, was surrounded by slaughterhouses and tanneries which emptied their waste directly into its waters. Trash piled up as well and by the early 1800s the lake was filled up and dry. [...] <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> was built Five Points, the United States' first slum. Five Points was occupied by successive waves of freed slaves, Irish, then Italian, then Chinese, immigrants. It housed the poor, rural people leaving farms for opportunity, and the persecuted people from Europe pouring into New York City. Bars, bordellos, squalid and lightless tenements lined its streets. Violence and crime were commonplace. Politicians and social elite discussed it with derision. Slums like Five Points triggered discussions of affordable housing and slum removal. As of the start of the 21st century, Five Points slum had been transformed into the Little Italy and Chinatown neighborhoods of New York City, through that city's campaign of massive urban renewal.|$|E

60|$|But {{these little}} critics do not well {{consider}} {{what is the}} work of a poet, and what the graces of a poem: the story is the least part of either: I mean the foundation of it, before it is modelled by the art of him who writes it; who forms it with more care, by exposing only the beautiful parts of it to view, than a skilful lapidary sets a jewel. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> of the story, the characters are raised: and, since no story can afford characters enough for the variety of the English stage, it follows, that it is to be altered and enlarged with new persons, accidents, and designs, which will almost make it new. When this is done, the forming it into acts and scenes, disposing of actions and passions into their proper places, and beautifying both with descriptions, similitudes, and propriety of language, is the principal employment of the poet; as being the largest field of fancy, which is the principal quality required in him: for so much the word [Greek: poiêtês] implies. Judgment, indeed, is necessary in him; but it is fancy that gives the life-touches, and the secret graces to it; especially in serious plays, which depend not much on observation. For, to write humour in comedy, (which is the theft of poets from mankind) little of fancy is required; the poet observes only what is ridiculous and pleasant folly, and by judging exactly what is so, he pleases in the representation of it.|$|E
60|$|In {{the latter}} part of the eighteenth century, the chemists had arrived at several very {{important}} generalisations respecting those properties of matter with which they were especially concerned. However plainly ponderable matter seemed to be originated and destroyed in their operations, they proved that, as mass or body, it remained indestructible and ingenerable; and that, so far, it varied only in its perceptibility by our senses. The course of investigation further proved that a certain number of the chemically separable kinds of matter were unalterable by any known means (except in so far as they might be made to change their state from solid to fluid, or vice versâ), unless they were brought into contact with other kinds of matter, and that the properties of these several kinds of matter were always the same, whatever their origin. All other bodies were found to consist of two or more of these, which thus took the place of the four 'elements' of the ancient philosophers. Further, it was proved that, in forming chemical compounds, bodies always unite in a definite proportion by weight, or in simple multiples of that proportion, and that, if any one body were taken as a standard, every other could have a number assigned to it as its proportional combining weight. It was <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> of fact that Dalton based his re-establishment of the old atomic hypothesis on a new empirical foundation. It is obvious, that if elementary matter consists of indestructible and indivisible particles, each of which constantly preserves the same weight relatively to all the others, compounds formed by the aggregation of two, three, four, or more such particles must exemplify the rule of combination in definite proportions deduced from observation.|$|E
60|$|It is {{my private}} opinion that, at {{this period of}} his life, Hollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people (among whom I include humorists of every degree), it {{required}} all the constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him an intolerable bore. Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such multiform presentation of one idea! His specific object (of which he made the public more than sufficiently aware, {{through the medium of}} lectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an edifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> he purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental culture of our criminal brethren. His visionary edifice was Hollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the material type in which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the scheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept his clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the bodily eye. I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet of paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the structure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be happy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of the building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time. Unlike all other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of being time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had never yet come into existence.|$|E

60|$|The single idea of M. Comte, on this subject, is {{that the}} intellect should be wholly subordinated to the feelings; or, to {{translate}} the meaning out of sentimental into logical language, that the exercise of the intellect, as of all our other faculties, should have for its sole object the general good. Every other employment of it should be accounted not only idle and frivolous, but morally culpable. Being indebted wholly to Humanity for the cultivation to which we owe our mental powers, we are bound in return to consecrate them wholly to her service. Having {{made up his mind}} that this ought to be, there is with M. Comte but one step to concluding that the Grand Pontiff of Humanity must take care that it shall be; and <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> he organizes an elaborate system for the total suppression of all independent thought. He does not, indeed, invoke the arm of the law, or call for any prohibitions. The clergy are to have no monopoly. Any one else may cultivate science if he can, may write and publish if he can find readers, may give private instruction if anybody consents to receive it. But since the sacerdotal body will absorb into itself all but those whom it deems either intellectually or morally unequal to the vocation, all rival teachers will, as he calculates, be so discredited beforehand, that their competition will not be formidable. Within the body itself, the High Priest has it in his power {{to make sure that there}} shall be no opinions, and no exercise of mind, but such as he approves; for he alone decides the duties and local residence of all its members, and can even eject them from the body. Before electing to be under this rule, we feel a natural curiosity to know in what manner it is to be exercised. Humanity has only yet had one Pontiff, whose mental qualifications for the post are not likely to be often surpassed, M. Comte himself. It is of some importance to know what are the ideas of this High Priest, concerning the moral and religious government of the human intellect.|$|E
60|$|One {{simple and}} {{touching}} memorial I well remember. There is a ferry between {{the town and}} the grounds near Netley Abbey. A lady had caught a cold, which terminated in death, in consequence of waiting on the shore, during a storm, for the arrival of a boat. To protect others from a similar calamity, she had ordered a very suitable defence against the weather to be built on the fatal spot, and to be kept in repair for ever. The structure is entirely of stone, small and exceedingly simple and ingenious. The ground plan is that of a Greek cross. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundation</b> are reared four walls, which, of course, cross each other in the centre at right angles. A little above the height of a man, the whole is amply roofed. Let the wind blow which way it will, you perceive there is always shelter. There is no external wall, and the diameter of the whole does not exceed ten feet, if it be as much. This little work is exceedingly English, and it is just as unlike anything American as possible. It has its origin in benevolence, is original in the idea, and it is picturesque. We might accomplish the benevolence, but it would be of a more public character: the picturesque is a thing of which we hardly know the meaning; and as for the originality, the dread of doing anything different from his neighbour would effectually prevent an American from erecting such a shelter; even charity with us being subject to the control of the general voice. On the other hand, what a clever expedient would have been devised, in the first instance, in America, to get across the ferry without taking cold! All these little peculiarities have an intimate connexion with national character and national habits. The desire to be independent and original causes a multitude of silly things to be invented here, while the apprehension of doing anything different from those around them causes a multitude of silly things to be perpetuated in America; and yet we are children of the same parents! When profit is in view, we have but one soul and that is certainly inventive enough; but when money has been made, and is to be spent, we really do not seem to know how to set about it, except by routine.|$|E

[...] These, and a thousand more, of doubtful fame, [...] To whom old fables gave a lasting name, [...] 130 [...] In ranks adorned the temple's outward face; [...] The wall in lustre and effect like glass, [...] Which o'er each object casting various dyes, [...] Enlarges some, and others multiplies:[55] [...] Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall, [...] 135 [...] For thus romantic Fame increases all. [...] The temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold,[56] [...] Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:[57] [...] Raised on a thousand pillars, wreathed around [...] With laurel-foliage, and with eagles crowned: [...] 140 [...] Of bright transparent beryl were the walls,[58] [...] The friezes gold, and gold the capitals: [...] As heav'n with stars, the roof with jewels glows, [...] And ever-living lamps depend in rows.[59] [...] Full in the passage of each spacious gate, [...] 145 [...] The sage historians in white garments wait;[60] [...] Graved o'er their seats the form of Time was found, [...] His scythe reversed, and both his pinions bound. [...] Within stood heroes, who through loud alarms [...] In bloody fields pursued renown in arms. [...] 150 [...] High on a throne with trophies charged, I viewed [...] The youth that all things but himself subdued;[61] [...] His feet on sceptres and tiaras trod, [...] And his horned head belied the Libyan god.[62] [...] There Cæsar, graced with both Minervas,[63] shone; [...] 155 [...] Cæsar, the world's great master, and his own;[64] [...] Unmoved, superior still in ev'ry state, [...] And scarce detested in his country's fate.[65] [...] But chief were those, who not for empire fought, [...] But with their toils their people's safety bought: [...] 160 [...] High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood;[66] [...] Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood;[67] [...] Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state; [...] Great in his triumphs, in retirement great; [...] And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind, [...] } [...] 165 [...] With boundless pow'r, unbounded virtue joined, [...] } [...] His own strict judge, and patron of mankind,[68] } [...] Much-suff'ring heroes next their honours claim, [...] Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame,[69] [...] Fair Virtue's silent train:[70] supreme of these [...] 170 [...] Here ever shines the godlike Socrates: [...] He whom ungrateful Athens could expel, [...] At all times just, but when he signed the shell:[71] [...] Here his abode the martyred Phocion claims,[72] [...] With Agis, not the last of Spartan names:[73] [...] 175 [...] Unconquered Cato shows the wound he tore,[74] [...] And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.[75] [...] But in {{the centre of the}} hallowed choir,[76] [...] Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;[77] [...] Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand, [...] 180 [...] Hold the chief honours, and the fane command. [...] High on the first, the mighty Homer shone;[78] [...] Eternal adamant composed his throne; [...] Father of verse! in holy fillets drest, [...] His silver beard waved gently o'er his breast; [...] 185 [...] Though blind, a boldness in his looks appears; [...] In years he seemed, but not impaired by years. [...] The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen: [...] Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian queen; [...] Here Hector, glorious from Patroclus' fall, [...] 190 [...] Here dragged in triumph round the Trojan wall:[79] [...] Motion and life did ev'ry part inspire, [...] Bold was the work, and proved the master's fire; [...] A strong expression most he seemed t' affect, [...] And here and there disclosed a brave neglect. [...] 195 [...] A golden column next in rank appear'd, [...] On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd; [...] Finished the whole, and laboured ev'ry part, [...] With patient touches of unwearied art: [...] The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate, [...] 200 [...] Composed his posture, and his looks sedate;[80] [...] On Homer still he fixed a rev'rent eye, [...] Great without pride, in modest majesty.[81] [...] In living sculpture[82] on the sides were spread [...] The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead; [...] 205 [...] Eliza stretched upon the fun'ral pyre, [...] Æneas bending with his aged sire: [...] Troy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne [...] "Arms and the man" [...] in golden ciphers shone. [...] Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,[83] [...] 210 [...] With heads advanced, and pinions stretched for flight:[84] [...] Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode, [...] And seem'd to labour with th' inspiring god. [...] Across the harp a careless hand he flings, [...] And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.[85] [...] 215 [...] The figured games of Greece the column grace, [...] Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race. [...] The youths hang o'er the chariots as they run; [...] The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone; [...] The champions in distorted postures threat,[86] [...] 220 [...] And all appeared irregularly great. [...] Here happy Horace tuned th' Ausonian lyre [...] To sweeter sounds, and tempered Pindar's fire: [...] Pleased with Aleæus' manly rage t'infuse [...] The softer spirit of the Sapphic muse.[87] [...] 225 [...] The polished pillar diff'rent sculptures grace; [...] A work outlasting monumental brass. [...] Here smiling loves and bacchanals appear, [...] The Julian star,[88] and great Augustus here. [...] The doves that round the infant poet spread [...] 230 [...] Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head. [...] Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light, [...] Sat fixed in thought the mighty Stagirite; [...] His sacred head a radiant zodiac crowned,[89] [...] And various animals his sides surround;[90] [...] 235 [...] His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view [...] Superior worlds,[91] and look all nature through. [...] With equal rays immortal Tully shone, [...] The Roman rostra decked the consul's throne: [...] Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seemed to stand [...] 240 [...] In act to speak, and graceful stretched his hand.[92] [...] Behind, Rome's genius waits with civic crowns, [...] And the great father of his country owns. [...] These massy columns in a circle rise, [...] O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:[93] [...] 245 [...] Scarce to the top I stretched my aching sight, [...] So large it spread, and swelled to such a height. [...] Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat[94] [...] With jewels blazed, magnificently great; [...] The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye, [...] 250 [...] The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye, [...] Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream, [...] And lucid amber casts a golden gleam. [...] With various-coloured light the pavement shone, [...] And all on fire appeared the glowing throne; [...] 255 [...] The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze, [...] And forms a rainbow of alternate rays. [...] When on the goddess first I cast my sight, [...] Scarce seemed her stature of a cubit's height;[95] [...] But swelled to larger size, the more I gazed, [...] 260 [...] Till to the roof her tow'ring front she raised. [...] With her, the temple ev'ry moment grew, [...] And ampler vistas opened to my view: [...] Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend, [...] And arches widen, and long aisles extend.[96] [...] 265 [...] Such was her form, as ancient bards have told, [...] Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold; [...] A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears, [...] And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.[97] [...] Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine [...] 270 [...] (Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine.[98] [...] With eyes on Fame for ever fixed, they sing; [...] For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string; [...] With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays, [...] And last, eternal, through the length of days. [...] 275 [...] Around these wonders as I cast a look, [...] The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook, [...] And all the nations, summoned at the call, [...] From diff'rent quarters fill the crowded hall: [...] Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard; [...] 280 [...] In various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared;[99] [...] Thick as the bees that with the spring renew [...] Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew, [...] When the winged colonies first tempt the sky, [...] O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly, [...] 285 [...] Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield, [...] And a low murmur runs along the field.[100] [...] Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend, [...] And all degrees before the goddess bend;[101] [...] The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, [...] 290 [...] And boasting youth, and narrative old age.[102] [...] Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same: [...] For good and bad alike are fond of fame. [...] Some she disgraced, and some with honours crowned;[103] [...] Unlike successes equal merits found.[104] [...] 295 [...] Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns, [...] And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains. [...] First at the shrine the learned world appear, [...] And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer. [...] Long have we sought t' instruct and please mankind, [...] 300 [...] With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind; [...] But thanked by few, rewarded yet by none, [...] We here appeal to thy superior throne: [...] On wit and learning the just prize bestow, [...] For fame is all we must expect below. [...] 305 [...] The goddess heard, and bade the muses raise [...] The golden trumpet of eternal praise:[105] [...] From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound, [...] That fills the circuit of the world around; [...] Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud; [...] 310 [...] The notes at first were rather sweet than loud: [...] By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise, [...] Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies, [...] At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed, [...] Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;[106] [...] 315 [...] Less fragrant scents th' unfolding rose exhales, [...] Or spices breathing in Arabian gales. [...] Next these the good and just, an awful train, [...] Thus on their knees address the sacred fane. [...] Since living virtue is with envy cursed, [...] 320 [...] And the best men are treated like the worst, [...] Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth, [...] And give each deed th' exact intrinsic worth.[107] [...] Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned, [...] (Said Fame,) but high above desert renowned:[108] [...] 325 [...] Let fuller notes th' applauding world amaze, [...] And the loud clarion labour in your praise. [...] This band dismissed, behold another crowd [...] Preferred the same request, and lowly bowed; [...] The constant tenour of whose well spent days [...] 330 [...] No less deserved a just return of praise. [...] But straight the direful trump of slander sounds; [...] Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds; [...] Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies, [...] The dire report through ev'ry region flies, [...] 335 [...] In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung, [...] And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue. [...] From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke [...] Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:[109] [...] The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies, [...] 340 [...] And withers all before it as it flies. [...] A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore, [...] And proud defiance in their looks they bore: [...] For thee, (they cried,) amidst alarms and strife, [...] We sailed in tempests down the stream of life; [...] 345 [...] For thee whole nations filled with flames and blood, [...] And swam to empire through the purple flood. [...] Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own, [...] What virtue seemed, was done for thee alone. [...] Ambitious fools! (the queen replied, and frowned) [...] 350 [...] Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned; [...] There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone, [...] Your statues mouldered, and your names unknown![110] [...] A sudden cloud straight snatched them from my sight, [...] And each majestic phantom sunk in night. [...] 355 [...] Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen; [...] Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien. [...] Great idol of mankind! we neither claim [...] The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame! [...] But safe in deserts from th' applause of men, [...] 360 [...] Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen; [...] 'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight [...] Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite. [...] O let us still the secret joy partake, [...] To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.[111] [...] 365 [...] And live there men, who slight immortal fame? [...] Who then with incense shall adore our name? [...] But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride [...] To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide. [...] Rise! muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath, [...] 370 [...] These must not sleep in darkness and in death. [...] She said: in air the trembling music floats, [...] And on the winds triumphant swell the notes:[112] [...] So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,[113] [...] Ev'n list'ning angels leaned from heav'n to hear: [...] 375 [...] To farthest shores th' ambrosial spirit flies, [...] Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. [...] Next these, a youthful train their vows expressed,[114] [...] With feathers crowned, with gay embroid'ry dress'd, [...] Hither, they cried, direct your eyes, and see [...] 380 [...] The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry; [...] Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays, [...] Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days; [...] Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care [...] To pay due visits, and address the fair: [...] 385 [...] In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, [...] But still in fancy vanquished ev'ry maid; [...] Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell, [...] Yet, would the world believe us, all were well. [...] The joy let others have, and we the name, [...] 390 [...] And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.[115] [...] The queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies, [...] And at each blast a lady's honour dies.[116] [...] Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers pressed [...] Around the shrine, and made the same request: [...] 395 [...] What! you (she cried) unlearn'd in arts to please, [...] Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigued with ease,[117] [...] Who lose a length of undeserving days, [...] Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise? [...] To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall, [...] 400 [...] The people's fable, and the scorn of all. [...] Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound, [...] Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round, [...] Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud, [...] And scornful hisses run through all the crowd. [...] 405 [...] Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done, [...] Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;[118] [...] Or who their glory's dire foundation laid [...] On sov'reigns ruined, or on friends betrayed;[119] [...] Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix, [...] 410 [...] Of crooked counsels and dark politics; [...] Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne, [...] And beg to make th' immortal treasons known. [...] The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire, [...] With sparks, that seemed to set the world on fire. [...] 415 [...] At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast, [...] And startled nature trembled with the blast. [...] This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown [...] Straight changed the scene, and snatched me from the throne.[120] [...] Before my view appeared a structure fair, [...] 420 [...] Its site uncertain, if in earth or air; [...] With rapid motion turned the mansion round; [...] With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound; [...] Not less in number were the spacious doors, [...] Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores; [...] 425 [...] Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day, [...] Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way. [...] As flames by nature to the skies ascend,[121] [...] As weighty bodies to the centre tend, [...] As to the sea returning rivers roll, [...] 430 [...] And the touched needle trembles to the pole; [...] Hither, as to their proper place, arise [...] All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies, [...] Or spoke aloud, or whispered in the ear; [...] Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here. [...] 435 [...] As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes [...] The sinking stone at first a circle makes; [...] The trembling surface, by the motion stirred, [...] Spreads in a second circle, then a third; [...] Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance, [...] 440 [...] Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance: [...] Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break, [...] On neighb'ring air a soft impression make; [...] Another ambient circle then they move; [...] That, in its turn, impels the next above;[122] [...] 445 [...] Through undulating[123] air the sounds are sent, [...] And spread o'er all the fluid element. [...] There, various news I heard of love and strife, [...] Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life, [...] Of loss and gain, of famine, and of store, [...] 450 [...] Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore, [...] Of prodigies, and portents seen in air, [...] Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair, [...] Of turns of fortune, changes in the state, [...] The falls of fav'rites, projects of the great, [...] 455 [...] Of old mismanagements, taxations new:[124] [...] All neither wholly false, nor wholly true. [...] Above, below, without, within, around, [...] Confused, unnumbered, multitudes are found, [...] Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away; [...] 460 [...] Hosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day: [...] Astrologers, that future fates foreshew, [...] Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few; [...] And priests, and party-zealots, num'rous bands [...] With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands; [...] 465 [...] Each talked aloud, or in some secret place, [...] And wild impatience stared in ev'ry face.[125] [...] The flying rumours gathered as they rolled, [...] Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told; [...] And all who told it added something new, [...] } [...] 470 [...] And all who heard it, made enlargements too; [...] } [...] In ev'ry ear it spread, on ev'ry tongue it grew. } [...] Thus flying east and west, and north and south, [...] News travelled with increase from mouth to mouth. [...] So from a spark, that kindled first by chance, [...] 475 [...] With gath'ring force the quick'ning flames advance;[126] [...] Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire, [...] And tow'rs and temples sink in floods of fire. [...] When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung, [...] Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue, [...] 480 [...] Through thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow, [...] And rush in millions on the world below. [...] Fame sits aloft,[127] and points them out their course, [...] Their date determines, and prescribes their force; [...] Some to remain, and some to perish soon; [...] 485 [...] Or wane and wax, alternate, like the moon. [...] Around, a thousand winged wonders fly, [...] Borne by the trumpet's blast, and scattered through the sky. [...] There, at one passage, oft you might survey, [...] A lie and truth contending for the way; [...] 490 [...] And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent, [...] Which first should issue through the narrow vent: [...] At last agreed, together out they fly, [...] Inseparable now, the truth and lie;[128] [...] The strict companions are for ever joined, [...] 495 [...] And this or that unmixed, no mortal e'er shall find. [...] While thus I stood, intent to see and hear, [...] One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:[129] [...] What could thus high thy rash ambition raise? [...] Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise? [...] 500 [...] 'Tis true, said I, not void of hopes I came, [...] For who so fond as youthful bards of fame? [...] But few, alas! the casual blessing boast, [...] So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.[130] [...] How vain that second life in others' breath, [...] 505 [...] Th' estate which wits inherit after death![131] [...] Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign; [...] Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine! [...] The great man's curse, without the gains, endure, [...] Be envied, wretched, and be flattered, poor; [...] 510 [...] All luckless wits their enemies professed, [...] And all successful, jealous friends at best. [...] Nor fame I slight, nor for her favours call; [...] She comes unlooked for, if she comes at all. [...] But if the purchase cost so dear a price, [...] 515 [...] As soothing folly, or exalting vice; [...] Oh! if the muse must flatter lawless sway, [...] And follow still where fortune leads the way;[132] [...] Or if no basis bear my rising name, [...] But the fall'n ruins of another's fame; [...] 520 [...] Then teach me, heav'n! to scorn the guilty bays; [...] Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise; [...] Unblemished let me live, or die unknown; [...] Oh! grant an honest fame, or grant me none! ...|$|E
40|$|Most often, in {{the case}} of typefied {{prefabricated}} systems, foundations are designed and constructed as prefabricated elements as well. When the structure is exposed to high intensity loading and founded on a weak soil, beam foundations are often used instead of pad foundations. Beam foundations, stiffening girders, as well as beams which support the façade elements or partition walls, are treated as beams on elastic foundations, while joint of these girders to pad foundations or vertical support elements of a precast structure can be treated as semi-rigid. Modeling of systems with semi-rigid joints on elastic foundations, for different levels of rigidity of connections, is illustrated by an example of a frame under static loading. On the basis {{of the results of the}} calculation carried out in this paper, it is evident that taking into account the elastic foundations of the member and the corresponding degree of fixation of the member <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>foundations</b> significantly affects the magnitude of the forces in the cross-sections of the member, and on the redistribution of influences in the entire structure. Yet, the foundations-and-soil interaction exerted the highest influence on the magnitude of the stress in the foundation structure itself...|$|R
