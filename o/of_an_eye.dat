5|$|Though Vamei {{was officially}} {{designated}} as a tropical storm, its intensity is disputed; some agencies classify it as a typhoon, based on sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and the appearance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> The storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern Peninsular Malaysia, causing $3.6million in damage (2001USD, $ USD) and five deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E
5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E

Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Christmas 1994 nor'easter was {{an intense}} cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. It {{developed}} {{from an area}} of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida. As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a tropical system, including the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> It attained a pressure of 970millibars on December 23 and 24, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|A large monsoon trough was {{anchored}} {{south of}} Guam {{towards the end}} of July. By July21, three areas of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one of which would later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900UTC on July21 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Later on July22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned. On July23, both the JMA and JTWC upped the depression into a tropical storm. Bess then began to intensify. At 0600UTC on July24, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. After the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye,</b> both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June27 and tracked westward {{to reach the}} eastern Pacific on July8. There, the system steadily gained organization and was declared a tropical depression by 1200UTC on July14. Moving slowly northwest, a low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature environment allowed the system to strengthen to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on July15. Following {{the development of a}} curved convection band and appearance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on satellite, Cosme was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 1800UTC the next day; it is at this time that the system attained its peak with winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987mb (hPa; 29.15inHg). Cosme tracked over ever cooler waters beginning at that time, causing the system to weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength. It turned west {{as a result of an}} intensifying ridge of high pressure to its north while continuing to deteriorate in organization. At 1800UTC on July18, Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific, and by 1800UTC on July22, no longer sustained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation early on July25.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{increased}} {{organization and}} the formation of banding features, it was estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Howard at 0000UTC on August31. A mid-level anticyclone located over southern California was steering the storm towards the northwest. Early on September1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that Howard had an 80percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of the storm and a highly favorable environment around the cyclone. Based on the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature, the NHC upgraded Howard to a hurricane early on September1 while the storm was located about 420mi (675km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Later that day, the eye of Howard became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric, deep convection. At 0600UTC on September2, Howard was upgraded to a major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higher. Shortly after, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 140mph (220km/h) while located about 410mi (660km) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Classified as Tropical Depression Five-E, {{the system}} tracked westward under the {{steering}} currents of a mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked {{a concentration of}} deep convection near the center. Conditions favored development, including warm sea surface temperatures, very low amounts of wind shear, and an established anticyclone over the cyclone. Convection became more centralized, coinciding with the improvement of upper-level outflow. Based on Dvorak classifications, {{it is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Daniel at 1200UTC on July17. Daniel quickly became better organized, exhibiting increased thunderstorm activity and banding features. A central dense overcast developed, and a well-defined rainband wrapped around the center of circulation. Based on the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Daniel to hurricane status late on July18 while it was located about 885miles (1420km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding with Chan-hom's abrupt {{collapse}} on July3, {{the system}} turned northeast as it entered a {{weakness in the}} steering ridge. Later that day, the broad circulation turned north-northwest. Wind shear eased early on July4 as the TUTT cell retreated {{to the north and}} the subtropical ridge steadily re-established itself. Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm. Late on July4 into July5, the center of Chan-hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands. While near the island, Chan-hom executed an unusual counter-clockwise loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough. Once clear of the Mariana Islands, steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow. Early on July7, Chan-hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA, following to a burst in central convection. Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> as convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation.|$|E
5|$|Conducive {{atmospheric}} conditions around Nanmadol on November29 {{led to the}} development of a central dense overcast, followed shortly thereafter by the formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> Nanmadol was upgraded to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on November30 and became a typhoon twelve hours later, tracking near Satawal, Woleai, and Yap State during this intensification phase. Following the upgrade to typhoon status, intensification briefly slowed but continued soon thereafter. At 0600UTC on December1, Nanmadol reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg), still east of the Philippines. The typhoon maintained this strength for roughly twelve hours before slightly weakening as it neared Luzon. At approximately 1200UTC on December2, Nanmadol made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora with winds of 140km/h (85mph).|$|E
5|$|Cresswell rejoined {{his first}} club York City, playing in League Two, on a one-month loan on 19 March 2013. He marked his second York debut by scoring a 73rd minute penalty kick on 23 March 2013 away to Torquay United in a 2–1 defeat. He played an {{important}} role as York fought against relegation, scoring twice in five appearances, before being recalled by new United caretaker manager Chris Morgan on 15 April 2013. In July 2013, new United manager David Weir stated that Cresswell would be leaving the club, before he signed for York permanently on a one-year contract on 16 July 2013. His first appearance after signing permanently came in the first match of 2013–14, a 1–0 home win over Northampton Town on 3 August 2013. Cresswell retired from playing on 5 December 2013, as a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> complaint and a knee injury. He made eight appearances for York in 2013–14.|$|E

5|$|Crossing {{over the}} central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea, Tropical Storm Dot grew {{in size and}} intensity. By June7, the storm entered the South China Sea and {{acquired}} a brief northerly component to its track. At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that Dot would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, Dot attained typhoon status on June8. Following the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye,</b> the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph).

5|$|Filming {{took place}} at the {{floating}} opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of Tosca required 1,500 extras. The production used a large model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye,</b> which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film. A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara, and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the Fonte Gaia. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful. By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks, where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built. The wrap party was held on 21 June.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Belle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August15 to the south of Iceland.|$|E
