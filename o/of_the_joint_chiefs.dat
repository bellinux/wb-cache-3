5|$|Arthur William Radford (27 February 1896– 17 August 1973) was a United States Navy admiral {{and naval}} aviator. In over 40 years of {{military}} service, Radford held {{a variety of}} positions including Vice Chief of Naval Operations, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet and later the second Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|However, he did {{not remain}} Chief of Staff for long. He was {{appointed}} Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff effective 1 July 1974.

Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government.

5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's {{relations with the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup was the most supportive of Kennedy of all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff. Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant {{for a second term}} in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{of these}} {{restrictions}} were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs,</b> General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{appointed}} Army General Maxwell D. Taylor as his Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff. Taylor, {{like most}} Army brass, {{was a major}} supporter of the Zeus program. Kennedy and Taylor initially agreed to build a huge Zeus deployment with seventy batteries and 7,000 missiles. McNamara was also initially {{in favor of the}} system, but suggested a much smaller deployment of twelve batteries with 1,200 missiles. A contrary note was put forth by Jerome Wiesner, recently appointed as Kennedy's scientific advisor, and chair of the 1959 PSAC report. He began to educate Kennedy on the technical problems inherent to the system. He also had lengthy discussions with David Bell, the budget director, who came to realize the enormous cost of any sort of reasonable Zeus system.|$|E

He was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3, which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1951 became Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953.
