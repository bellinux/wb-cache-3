5000|$|The {{following}} month of November, Pomerleau created a <b>private</b> firm <b>called</b> [...] "Baltimore's Best Security". This firm {{was to create}} special quasi-private police force for maintaining security of public buildings. Members of this force would have more authority than those of <b>ordinary</b> <b>private</b> firms; however, {{they would not be}} subject to city personnel regulations. [...] The creation of the company—and its immediate endorsement and announcement of a no-bid contract by Mayor Schaefer—provoked an outcry from Baltimoreans, who called it expensive and unaccountable and feared that it would be favored over some of the city's preexisting black-owned firms.|$|R

40|$|Willingness {{to accept}} (WTA) is usually {{substantially}} higher than {{willingness to pay}} (WTP). These constructs have been studied for roughly 30 years and {{with a wide variety}} of goods. This paper reviews those studies. We find that the less the good is like an "ordinary market good," the higher is the ratio. The ratio is highest for non-market goods, next highest for <b>ordinary</b> <b>private</b> goods, and lowest for experiments involving forms of money. A generalization of this pattern holds even when we account for differences in survey design: ordinary goods have lower ratios than non-ordinary ones. We also find that ratios in real experiments are not significantly different from hypothetical experiments and that incentive-compatible elicitation yields higher ratios...|$|R
