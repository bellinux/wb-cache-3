50|$|The {{importance}} of the Taylor contract is that it introduces nominal rigidity into the economy. In macroeconomics if all wages and prices are perfectly flexible, then money is neutral and the classical dichotomy holds. In previous Keynesian models, such as the IS-LM model it had simply been assumed that wages and/or prices were fixed in the short-run so that money could affect GDP and employment. John Taylor saw that by introducing staggered or <b>overlapping</b> <b>contracts,</b> he could allow some wages to respond to current shocks immediately, {{but the fact that}} some were set one period ago was enough to introduce a dynamics into wages (and prices). Even if there was a one off shock to the money supply,with Taylor contracts it will set of a process of wage adjustment that will take time to react during which output (GDP) and employment can differ from the long-run equilibrium.|$|E

To this end we consider an extended {{version of the}} simple Barro and Gordon framework featuring important aspects of actual policy making such as imperfect instrument control, <b>overlapping</b> wage <b>contracts,</b> policy lags and interest rate control. The model developed provides a counterexample to the standard theory as it yields the result that a deflationary bias may be possible as well.

It demonstrates that fixed exchange-rate regimes such as the international gold standard and the Bretton Woods gold-dollar standard appear to be associated with negligible persistence of inflation in the industrial economies, while regimes of managed exchange rates are associated with very high persistence of inflation: the interwar period is associated with persistent deflation, the more recent period of managed floating with persistent inflation. The paper uses an <b>overlapping</b> <b>contracts</b> model of inflation to propose that the persistence of higher inflation in managed exchangerate regimes {{is a result of the}} accommodation of inflationdifferentials by exchange-rate policy.

However, we find that potential gains in targeting sector specific inflation rates rather than the aggregate inflation rate is very sensitive to the shape of the distribution. We show that except for the cases where prices/wages are reoptimized very frequently, the performance of the sectoral rule can be closely approximated by a simple rule that targets aggregate inflation.

40|$|There is wide {{agreement}} that the dynamics of inflation and unemployment are influenced by supply and demand shocks, such as oil price and monetary policy surprises, and by systematic factors such as <b>overlapping</b> <b>contracts.</b> There is less agreement about {{the relative importance of}} those determinants. The natural rate model of this paper uses a structural VAR approach to decompose movements in U. S. postwar unemployment and inflation into three orthogonal components. These components correspond, respectively, to systematic or predictable changes, supply shocks, and demand shocks. Orthogonality facilitates the detailed analysis of the individual components. Specifically, supply and demand shocks are shown to be correlated with observable variables in sensible ways, and they are used to analyze and interpret inflation-unemployment tradeoffs and postwar business cycles. In addition, the systematic component of inflation, which is equivalent to a NAIRU gap, is shown to predict changes in inflation reasonably well over a one-year horizon.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a model where agents {{learn about the}} probability of devaluations in a fixed exchange rate regim e. The true probability of devaluation {{is assumed to be}} low (or zero) b ut agents are initially unsure about the government's intentions and st art with a high prior belief. Bayesian updating dictates that private sector expectations are revised down during periods when no devaluat ion occurs, but are sharply increased when a devaluation does occur. Thi s model of learning is embedded in a model of <b>overlapping</b> <b>contracts</b> to study the process of inflation convergence after ERM entry. The main results are that agents over-estimate the authorities' desired realignment rate, so inflation will be high in anticipation; but as the authorities do not actually devalue, there is a terms of trade loss leading to recession. Before long-run equilibrium in which agents correctly estimate realignment rates can be attained, competitivenes s losses actually have to be regained by a sustained deflation.

Second, {{do we need to}} agree on a particular scheme for nominal rigidities to answer that question? We compute a quadratic approximation to agents expected lifetime utility and evaluate welfare for different modeling schemes of nominal rigidities that all have the same average duration of contracts. Calvo (1983) wage and price contracts can deliver sizeable welfare costs, but other contracts of the same average stickiness cannot. Calvo (1983) contracts can imply welfare costs that are up to 4 times higher than those implied by <b>overlapping</b> <b>contracts</b> in the spirit of Taylor (1980) or Wolman (1999).

In the content of the model, we show that aggregate demand shocks have only temporary effects on real stock prices, while supply shocks may affect the level of real stock prices permanently. Moreover, the temporary component in U.

This evidence supports the mean-reversion hypothesis that stock prices are not pure random walks. The finding is robust to the choice of variables used in the vector autoregressive system and periodicity. ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a survey of}} the recent work on learning in the context of macroeconomics. Learning has several roles. First, it {{provides a}} boundedly rational model of how rational expectations can be achieved. Secondly, learning acts as a selection device in models with multiple REE (rational expectations equilibria). Third, the learning dynamics themselves may be of interest. While there are various approaches to learning in macroeconomics, the emphasis here is on adaptive learning schemes in which agents use statistical or econometric techniques in self-referential stochastic systems. Careful attention is given to learning in models with multiple equilibria. The methodological tool is to set up the economic system under learning as a SRA (stochastic recursive algorithm) and to analyze convergence by the method of stochastic approximation based on an associated differential equation. Global stability, local stability and instability results for SRAs are presented. For a wide range of solutions to economic models the stability conditions for REE under statistical learning rules are given by the expectational stability principle, which is treated as a unifying principle for the results presented. Both linear and nonlinear economic models are considered and in the univariate linear case the full set of solutions is discussed. Applications include the Muth cobweb model, the Cagan model of inflation, asset pricing with risk neutrality, the overlapping generations model, the seignorage model of inflation, models with increasing social returns, IS-LM-Phillips curve models, the <b>overlapping</b> <b>contract</b> model, and the Real Business Cycle model. Particular attention is given to the local stability conditions for convergence when there are indeterminacies, bubbles, multiple steady states, cycles or sunspot solutions. The survey also discusses alternative approaches and recent developments, including Bayesian learning, eductive approaches, genetic algorithms, heterogeneity, misspecified models and experimental evidence. ...|$|R
