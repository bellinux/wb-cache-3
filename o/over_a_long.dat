Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present.

5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E

5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one. Both the French and the Russians {{suffered}} terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, and a clear advantage in the logistics war. The French Army supplies came <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> road lined with hostile forces. According to Rhien, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E

5|$|Some {{germanium}} compounds {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member. More broadly, Khitan is an Altaic language, although scholars are divided on the question whether the Altaic is a true language family or linguistic area in which originally distinct languages have influenced each other <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period. Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the Uighur peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for several hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was among}} the first to be studied <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity.

5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
