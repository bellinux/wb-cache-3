The steel chassis tubes themselves were of a thinner gauge than the 12's, sacrificing strength in Chapman's quest for weight-saving. However, the handling of the car was badly compromised by the unequal weight distribution which resulted from the engine positioning, and the 16 had to be reworked to accept its engine in a more conventional, albeit obliquely aligned, central location.|$|E

50|$|To {{meet the}} new requirement, George William Patchett, the chief {{designer}} at the Sterling Armaments Company of Dagenham, submitted a sample weapon of new design in early 1944.

Towards the end of the Second World War, some of these trial samples were used in combat by airborne troops during the battle of Arnhem and by special forces at other locations in Northern Europe where it was officially known as the Patchett Machine Carbine Mk 1. For example, a Patchett submachine gun (serial numbered 078 and now held by the Imperial War Museum), was carried in action by Colonel Robert W.P. Dawson while he was Commanding Officer of No. 4 Commando, during the attack on Walcheren as part of Operation Infatuate in November 1944. Because the Patchett/Sterling can use straight Sten submachine gun magazines as well as the curved Sterling design, there were no interoperability problems.|$|E
5000|$|The Reisekamera, {{meaning a}} [...] "travel camera", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost {{standardised}} design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, {{but not as}} cumbersome as the studio camera. A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it {{might just as well}} be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks {{on either side of the}} baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens <b>offset</b> <b>position.</b> The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery.

5000|$|Defensive {{armament}} comprised, as envisioned, a five-turret compliment {{of defensive}} ordnance positions, {{with only two}} of these directly manned, and the remainder all remotely operated: a forward, remotely operated Fernbedienbare Drehlafette FDL 151Z [...] "chin turret" [...] under the extreme nose with twin MG 151/20 cannon much as the 177B-series was intended to use, with a 20º [...] "upwards"-tilted axis of traverse in the turret mount design to provide a small degree of elevated fire, twin dorsal turrets - a second remotely operated FDL 151Z forward emplacement, otherwise similar in appearance to the proposed chin turret, and a manned Hydraulische Drehlafette HDL 151Z rear dorsal emplacement - each armed {{with a pair of}} MG 151/20 cannon, with both dorsal turrets providing aftwards-section defensive fire upwards and to the sides and rear; an aft remotely operated FDL-family ventral turret for lower rearwards defense, just behind the bomb bay's rear edge with another pair of MG 151/20 cannon with the gunner laying prone, facing rearwards in a starboard-side <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> that possessed a slightly-protruding ventral blister-like gondola for the gunner's position to sight the rear ventral remote turret, and a manned Hecklafette HL 131V tail turret with a quartet of MG 131 heavy machine guns. The Hecklafette had also been planned to be used on some of the other Amerika Bomber competing airframes for their own tail-mounted defensive armament, in addition to Heinkel's own A-6 and A-7 proposed versions of the original He 177A airframe, and the nascent He 177B-5 to be in production at Arado Flugzeugwerke by November 1944, and meant to be fitted onto not only the incomplete He 177 V104 B-series [...] "finalized" [...] prototype airframe as the B-5's production prototype, but also a projected [...] "C-version" [...] of the He 219 night fighter. This increasing demand for an advanced [...] "quadmount" [...] gun turret within the Heinkel firm's own range of late-war combat aircraft designs, that had not even been produced by the Borsig firm responsible for it, beyond a small number of test units and engineering mockups led to an alternative twin-cannon [...] "HL 151Z" [...] version to be planned for. This newly conceived twin-cannon adaptation was meant to use new elevation gun-mount assemblies with the HL 131V's core traverse shell, with each new elevation unit configured to take a single MG 151/20 cannon per turret side. Only a few ground test examples of the twin-cannon variant tail turret had been produced by March 1944. [...] One of these twin-cannon experimental tail turrets was mounted on an He 177A airframe for testing, possibly any of the He 177 V32 through V34 prototypes already configured to take the original HL 131V turret, from photographic evidence of such a fitment. Some sideview line drawing depictions of purported [...] "He 277" [...] aircraft, usually in the same aviation history volumes as the [...] "He 177B/He 277" [...] storyline has been purveyed, also show what could be an early He 177A-7-based depiction of the later Amerika Bomber competitor bearing the He 177A's [...] "Cabin 3" [...] standard cockpit and a quartet of the He 219-derived unitized DB 603 inverted V12 engines actually used on the four He 177B-series prototypes (He 177 V101 through V104) for power, with the abandoned Bugstandlafette BL 131V quadmount remote turret as a [...] "chin turret" [...] in place of the FDL 151Z system as depicted in the Heinkel firm's factory Typenblatt drawings — the BL 131V had already been abandoned in 1943 as too heavy (reducing offensive bombload by a full tonne) and slowing the earlier He 177A airframe by some 30 km/h in top airspeed due to drag, making even the chance of its proposed existence on any He 277 design proposals unlikely.|$|E

40|$|Information {{received}} from different sensory modalities profoundly influences human perception. For example, {{changes in the}} auditory flutter rate induce changes in the apparent flicker rate of a flashing light (Shipley, 1964). In the present study, we investigated whether auditory information would affect the perceived <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object. In Experiment 1, a visual object moved {{toward the center of}} the computer screen and disappeared abruptly. A transient auditory signal was presented at different times relative to the moment when the object disappeared. The results showed that if the auditory signal was presented before the abrupt offset of the moving object, the perceived final position was shifted backward, implying that the perceived <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> was affected by the transient auditory information. In Experiment 2, we presented the transient auditory signal to either the left or the right ear. The results showed that the perceived offset shifted backward more strongly when the auditory signal was presented to the same side from which the moving object originated. In Experiment 3, we found that the perceived timing of the visual offset was not affected by the spatial relation between the auditory signal and the visual offset. The present results are interpreted as indicating that an auditory signal may influence the <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object through both spatial and temporal processes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> to make the mount adjustment. The star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error.
