5|$|A {{trap crop}} is a crop <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop {{can be more}} easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E

5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies used}} by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants {{are not easily}} found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal growth patterns. Another approach diverts herbivores toward eating non-essential parts, or enhances the ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> {{to recover from the}} damage caused by herbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant.

40|$|The {{root system}} of {{perennials}} {{is composed of}} the roots of different growth years. The nutrient storage capacities and activities <b>of</b> roots are <b>an</b> important basis for judging root components and plant senescence. In this research, changes in the contents of water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) were used as indicators of the nutrient storage and activity of roots of different life years. From the early resprouting stage to the rapid growth stage, Artemisia scoparia L. plants of 1 - 3 age classes were sampled and measured once every 18 days. The nutrient storage capacities and activity rhythms of plant root components of the three age classes were analysed quantitatively. Among the A. scoparia population in northeast China, the nutrient storage capacities of 1 a/ 2 <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> root collars and 2 -year old roots were generally large, whereas those <b>of</b> 3 <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> root collars and 3 -year old roots were significantly reduced. As {{for changes in the}} WSC content in the root system at the 18 day resprouting stage, the decline rates in the root collars <b>of</b> the 1 <b>a</b> and 2 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> were 102 and 109 times those <b>of</b> the 3 <b>a</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. The decline rate in the 2 -year old roots <b>of</b> the 1 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> was 1. 8 times that <b>of</b> the 2 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> and 29. 6 times that <b>of</b> the 3 <b>a</b> <b>plants.</b> When nutrients were most active, all root components <b>of</b> the 1 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> entered into the resprouting stage, but the 2 / 3 -year old roots <b>of</b> the 2 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> lagged behind. All the root components <b>of</b> the 3 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> generally lagged. At the vegetative growth stage, the WSC contents in all root components <b>of</b> the 1 <b>a</b> <b>plants</b> declined logarithmically. For the 3 <b>a</b> <b>plants,</b> the content in the root collars decreased linearly with that in the 3 -year old roots.

5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} by ecologists due {{to a number of}} unique features it possesses. It is a representative example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant's ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has also been shown to be an effective index of how intense foraging by deer is in a particular area.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells {{at the site}} of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E
5000|$|Exfoliation (from {{the term}} [...] "foliate", meaning “related to leaves”) means the removal or loss <b>of</b> leaves from <b>a</b> <b>plant.</b> It is used both to {{describe}} the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leaves as <b>a</b> natural part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant’s</b> life cycle (such {{as in the case}} of deciduous trees which lose their leaves in the autumn) or because of some trauma or outside cause (such as dehydration, <b>an</b> infestation <b>of</b> caterpillars or hurricane-force winds).|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb to the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> represents its genus and its species within the genus, {{resulting in a}} single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E

The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River {{system has}} a long history of {{hydroelectric}} power generation, with the first hydroelectric power plant in Japan being located in the system. During the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> on the Shinano River in the Niigata Prefecture in July 1922, it was reported at the time that Korean workers were being mistreated and murdered. The Shinano River incident involved 1,200 workers, approximately 600 of whom were Korean, who were subjected to regular mistreatment by their Japanese foremen. The mistreatment included malnutrition, forced labour up to sixteen hours a day and severe beatings for those who tried to escape. News articles at the time alleged that up to 100 Koreans were killed during construction and that local farmers had reported seeing bodies floating down river. This incident occurred following the annexation of Korea by Japan and was partially responsible for the development of trade unions for Korean workers in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E

5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so on the underside <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> overhanging open sand. It {{has been found that}} these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

Furthermore, the productivity effect of other firms’ proximity-weighted R&D is, on average, positive, but this impact increases in the distance from the technological frontier. Another important finding is that all the plants tend to converge towards the industry’s technological frontier despite the size of external R&D spillovers. ...|$|R
