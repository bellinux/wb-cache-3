40|$|Net {{private capital}} flows to {{developing}} countries rebounded in 2002, after falling below $ 20 billion in 2000 and 2001. However, despite the recovery, such flows stayed at {{less than a quarter}} of the peak reached in 1996, before the outbreak of the East Asian financial crisis. Foreign direct investment (FDI) remained the only positive component among the broad categories of private capital inflows, but it was well below the historical high registered in 2001 (table 2. 1). The <b>other</b> components, <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment</b> and bank lending, were again negative. Net official flows, including IMF lending, were stable at the level attained in 2001.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{common with}} {{emerging}} countries in Asia and Latin America, South Africa received substantial capital inflows following socio-political and financial liberalisation in the mid- 1990 s. However, {{unlike many other}} emerging countries, the bulk of South Africa’s post-liberalisation inflows {{have been in the}} traditionally short-term forms of portfolio and other investment. Hence, in this thesis, a macroeconometric analysis of South Africa’s post-liberalisation capital flow components is conducted to investigate the extent to which their divergent impacts have complicated, or even rendered impotent, the dual policy goals of attracting capital inflows on the one hand, while mitigating any significant detrimental impacts on the other. The results of the analysis show that foreign direct investment is responsive to domestic factors, while portfolio and other flows respond to a combination of domestic and foreign factors. However, domestic business cycle fluctuations are found to have a greater effect on the capital outflows than the capital inflows, and are thus associated with heightened capital flight and repatriation during expansionary phases. Although the capital flow components are found to have varied effects on South Africa’s macroeconomy, transmission mechanisms, nominal Rand/U. S. Dollar exchange rate, and economic growth dynamics, the ‘hot’ flows are found to demonstrate greater boom-bust characteristics compared to foreign direct investment. Conventional economic theory posits that the destabilising effects can be controlled using fiscal and monetary policy mechanisms. However, analysis of the cyclical relationships between the capital flows and fiscal policy finds that <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> tend to be counter-cyclically associated with fiscal policy, while <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment</b> tends to be acyclical, indicating that the bulk of South Africa’s net capital inflows do not have a significant cyclical relationship with fiscal policy. In addition, <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> <b>other</b> <b>investment</b> are found to have inconsistent cyclical relationships with monetary policy, while <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment</b> tends to be procyclical. Thus, this research finds that although South Africa has been able to use exchange rate flexibility and sterilisation to neutralise the early stages of capital inflows, the divergent characteristics of the country’s post-liberalisation capital flow components have limited the fiscal and monetary policy options available to mitigate the detrimental capital flow effects arising from structural factors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} South Africa’s economic fundamentals on <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} main determinants of investment in South Africa are resource prices, input productivity and the economic performance of the domestic economy. The results illustrate that <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment</b> are close but not perfect substitutes. In addition, we find that an increase in labour input costs reduces both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Further, an increase in fixed capital productivity increases <b>net</b> direct <b>investment.</b> Further, also the results illustrate that subsidies increase both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Moreover, an increase in exports increases both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Policy recommendations are thus proposed that may increase foreign direct investment in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty five years, current account {{imbalances}} have been both rising over the trend and have become more volatile over the cycle. In boom times, imbalances expanded while in times of a cyclical downturn they shrank. A rising trend has been mainly explained with two developments: first, the increasing capacity and willingness of international financial markets to relax domestic savings constraints in financing domestic investment and consumption, and second constraints in domestic financial markets of some countries to efficiently absorb high domestic savings. The cyclical observation has often been derived from changes in trade flows and the 'slicing up' of the value added chain. For a number {{of supply and demand}} reasons, cross-border value-added chains grow during an upswing and shrink during downturns. Hence, the ups and down in intermediate trade have been made widely responsible for cyclical variations in the current account. However, the focus on only one of three components of the current account, the trade balance, hides the look on the two <b>other</b> components, <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> income (in the figures labeled as net income) and transfers. It will be shown in this Policy Brief that these two components have also been subject to important changes over the trend and cycle and that these changes vary substantially between six different groups of countries. In particular, both investment income flows and transfers are very likely to become more important as elements of inter-temporal consumption smoothening between emerging markets as the origin of payments to ageing economies as recipients or between emerging markets and advanced countries {{on the one hand and}} poor countries as recipients on the other hand (for instance, remittances) ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy. A well-known approach associates national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> with the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> {{can be defined as}} the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector. In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone. In empirical studies, commodity flow approach can be a better alternative if the purpose is to estimate the contributions to national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> of a recipient of future cash flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} welfare {{accounting}} shows that comprehensive measures of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> {{can be used}} to test whether an economy is following unsustainable paths of consumption.

Calculating augmented <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> for the world’s top twenty oil producers, we show that the difference with standard non-augmented measures can be large and may even revert some established conclusions regarding sustainability: prospects are more favorable than previously thought in oil-exporting countries endowed with large reserves like Angola, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.

As {{a result of this}} development, how to classify financial instruments, recognition of these principles has become important. As a result of the every day increase in types of financial instruments, financial risks have emerged. Especially {{after the end of the}} Bretton Woods system that based on fixed exchange rates in 1970 ’s, entities faced the financial risk.

Evidence from a {{balanced}} panel of 18 industries between 1967 and 1987 reveals a negative non-linear relationship. The negative relation occurs at levels of unionization between 0 and approximately 50 %, with a plateau above this level.

INTRODUCTION This paper examines the relationship between the level of industry unionization and industry investment in Canada for the period 1967 - 1987.
