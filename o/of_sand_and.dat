5|$|The geology of {{the borough}} is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly {{composed}} of sand with patches of clay {{to the east}} and west, and superficial deposits (drift) <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel cover the entire area. The extraction <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel for construction purposes is carried out in the borough and the opening of more sites is planned.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Islet, in the south, is {{the second}} largest. It is {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> coral rubble that borders the lagoon. It is named after HMS Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E

30|$|It {{is shown}} in the {{previous}} sections that the compression behaviour <b>of</b> different <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> clays (separately) can be uniquely represented using the new normalisation scheme. An obvious step forward thus would be to directly compare the compression response <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> clays so that a unified compression relationship could be developed for both soils.|$|R
5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
5|$|The land {{beneath the}} Bay Area {{consists}} of layers <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> clay to great depths. These layers {{were created by}} millennia of river-borne sediments which gradually incorporated plant and animal matter creating the petroleum deposits for which the Gulf Coast is known.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
50|$|The area lies on Matangi soils, {{formed on}} the edge of the Komakorau Bog and the Waikato's {{alluvial}} plains <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> gravels.|$|R

50|$|Around the village, {{there are}} several woods (comprising oaks, beeches, chestnuts, and poplars), fields (comprising potatoes, sugar beets, corn, and wheat), and prairies (for cows and horses). The ground is made <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> silts.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> cement {{was applied to}} the {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> terrigenous material.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the Boeing Creek's {{watershed}} {{is dominated}} by <b>sands,</b> gravels, <b>and</b> silts created during the last glacial period. Materials present include subglacial tills made up <b>of</b> silt, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> gravel particles; advance outwash deposits, made up <b>of</b> well-sorted <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> gravels; and transitional beds, made up of compacted clay, silt, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>sand.</b>|$|R

5|$|The area {{through which}} the Wheeldale {{structure}} runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its forest cover was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the ancient and modern eras. The underlying geology consists of patches <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel on top of mixed sandstone and oolitic limestone, known as Ravenscar Group strata.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Lymm lies {{to the south}} west of Warburton in the borough of Warrington, with the River Bollin forming {{the border between the}} two villages. The Bollin joins the River Mersey in the village; however the Mersey in Warburton has dried up, as it was {{diverted}} into the Manchester Ship Canal further upstream. To the east lie Dunham Town, Dunham Massey, Bowdon and Altrincham, with Little Bollington to the south, and Partington and Urmston to the north. The local geology is lower keuper marl, with a ridge <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel running from Warburton to Dunham.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Colonel C. Craig Cannon, the Brigade {{prepared}} for deployment to Vietnam. The Advance Party of the 18th Engineer Brigade arrived at Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 3 September 1965. Three days later, Brigadier General Robert R. Ploger assumed command of the Brigade. Within two weeks, the Brigade Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut was fully operational. It had been preceded by the 35th Engineer Group, which built Cam Ranh Bay on a peninsula <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> in a hostile environment. The brigade assumed responsibility for I Corps and II Corps {{in the northern part}} of South Vietnam. The 937th Engineer Group (Combat) at Qui Nhơn was assigned to the Brigade in June 1966.|$|E

5|$|Excavation for the {{powerhouse}} {{was carried}} out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before {{the last of the}} concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about , topped with layers <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> tar.|$|E
5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on the Head was established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area which seems to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to come to them. Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E

5|$|No.1 Wing {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Richmond on 7October 1942. Its initial {{commander}} was Group Captain Allan Walters and the wing leader was Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war. At {{this time the}} RAAF had received 71 tropicalised variants of the Spitfire Vc and another 33 were en route to Australia. These aircraft differed from the standard Spitfire Vc in that they were optimised for use in desert and tropical areas and had been fitted with a Vokes air filter beneath their nose {{to reduce the amount}} <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> dust which entered the engine; Caldwell believed that this modification reduced the Spitfires' performance. As well as the three Spitfire squadrons, No.1 Wing also included No. 10 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters. Many of the squadrons' most experienced pilots were posted to other units before they departed Britain, and only 37 of the 95 pilots in the wing as at May 1943 had previously seen combat.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
