Terpenes are emitted from woody building materials, and ozone is generated from <b>ozone</b> <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> and copy machines in indoor environments.

Therefore, coexistent CCs should affect the ozone oxidation. This study has focused on the measurement of secondary products during the ozone oxidation of terpenes based on the use of PTR-MS analysis and effects of coexistent CCs on oxidized products. Experiments were performed in a fluoroplastic bag containing α-pinene or limonene as terpenes, ozone and acetaldehyde or formaldehyde as coexistent CCs adjusted to predetermined concentrations. Continuous measurements by PTR-MS were conducted after mixing of terpenes, ozone and CCs, and time changes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentrations were monitored.

40|$|Particulate {{pollution}} {{has important}} consequences for human health, {{and is an}} issue of global concern. Outdoor air pollution has become a cause for alarm in India in particular because recent data suggest that ambient pollution levels in Indian cities are some of the highest in the world. We study the number of particles between 0. 5 μm and 2. 5 μm indoors while using affordable <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> in the highly polluted city of Delhi. Though substantial reductions in indoor number concentrations are observed during <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> use, indoor <b>air</b> quality while using an <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> is frequently worse than in cities with moderate pollution, and often worse than levels observed even in polluted cities. When outdoor pollution levels are higher, on average, indoor pollution levels while using an <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> are also higher. Moreover, the ratio of indoor air quality during <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> use to two comparison measures of air quality without an <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> are also positively correlated with outdoor pollution levels, suggesting that as ambient air quality worsens there are diminishing returns to improvements in indoor air quality during <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> use.

40|$|Abstract. Air {{pollution}} has {{a significant}} impact of human health. As modern individuals {{spend most of the}} day in tightly insulated buildings, there is a strong need for strategies {{to improve the quality of}} indoor air. A number of air cleaning methods ranging from simple filtration to photonic technologies have been used in commercial and residential <b>air</b> <b>purifiers.</b> Recently, a novel technology called Nano-Confined Catalytic Oxidation (NCCO) has been developed. In this study, the potential of NCCO versus two other commonly-used <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> to reduce odor nuisances caused by ammonia, toluene and hydrogen sulfide is evaluated. Twenty volunteers are asked to evaluate the odor levels before and after air purification, in a safe, controlled environment. The changes in odorant concentrations are also measured.

However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University said that only some of these products, like High Efficiency Particulate air filters, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> like ionizing purifiers gave off ozone which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze.

50|$|As {{with other}} {{health-related}} appliances, there is controversy surrounding {{the claims of}} certain companies, especially involving ionic <b>air</b> <b>purifiers.</b> Many <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> generate some <b>ozone,</b> an energetic allotrope of three oxygen atoms, and {{in the presence of}} humidity, small amounts of NOx. Because {{of the nature of the}} ionization process, ionic <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> tend to generate the most ozone. This is a serious concern, because ozone is a criteria air pollutant regulated by health-related US federal and state standards. In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms.|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} photocatalytic HEPA filters on microorganism disinfection in a closed-loop chamber and later applied it in an <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> and tested its efficacy in an 8 -m 3 chamber and in a hospital. The photocatalytic filters were made by dip-coating a HEPA filter in a TiO 2 slurry. In order to disinfect the microorganisms retained on the filter, UV-A light was irradiated onto the filter to create strong oxidative radicals which can destroy microorganisms. The findings showed that disinfection efficiency of the photocatalytic filters with high TiO 2 loading was insignificantly higher than with lower loading. S. epidermidis was completely eliminated within 2 hours, while 86. 8 % of B. subtilis, 77. 1 % of A. niger, and 82. 7 % of P. citrinum were destroyed within 10 hours.
