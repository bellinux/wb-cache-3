40|$|Abstract- The {{article is}} devoted to {{algebraic}} features of structural phenomena of molecular ensembles <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code. Matrix forms of presentations <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code allow showing deep relations <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code with dyadic shifts and algebras of 8 -dimensional hypercomplex numbers. Hadamard matrices and orthogonal systems of Rademacher and Walsh functions, which are well-known formalisms from discrete signal processing, participate in this discovery of hidden structural features <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code. The described results are useful to understand a noncasual character <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code systems, which has a deep algebraic nature.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs.

Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity.

40|$|The matrix {{form of the}} {{presentation}} <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code is described as the cognitive form to analyze structures <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> code.

40|$|Additive genetic {{variance}} in natural populations is commonly estimated using mixed models, {{in which the}} covariance <b>of</b> the <b>genetic</b> effects is modeled by a genetic similarity matrix derived from a dense set of markers.

5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role <b>of</b> <b>genetic</b> variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
