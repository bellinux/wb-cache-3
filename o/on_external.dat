5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies <b>on</b> <b>external</b> fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely <b>on</b> <b>external</b> fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 <b>on</b> <b>external</b> pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E

5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>external</b> appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar}} to Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species may be {{difficult}} to distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Between 2010 and 2012 Tharoor {{remained}} {{active in}} Parliament and was member-convenor of the Parliamentary Forum on Disaster Management, {{a member of}} the Standing Committee <b>on</b> <b>External</b> Affairs, of the Consultative Committee of Defence, the Public Accounts Committee, and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Telecoms.

In the special debate on the 60th anniversary of the Indian Parliament, Tharoor was one of four members of the Congress Party, including party President Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee, to be invited to address the Lok Sabha.|$|E
5|$|The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a {{stealthy}} {{cruise missile}} platform {{to deliver the}} W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead. Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated {{so that it would}} only be carried by the B-52H, mounted <b>on</b> <b>external</b> pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.|$|E

5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest {{of the three groups}} is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based <b>on</b> <b>external</b> and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based <b>on</b> <b>external</b> appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely <b>on</b> <b>external</b> consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
