5|$|Despite {{economic}} growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained {{the largest number}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005; under its later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's {{children under the age}} of five are underweight.

5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar.

Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} three types of living arrangements, namely living alone, living with family, {{and living in a}} hostel, and the psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> in Hong Kong. The impact of various sociodemographic factors on the choice of <b>living</b> arrangements <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> was also studied. Methods: Ninety healthy Hong Kong Chinese were recruited from four multi-service centres and one hostel. An individual interview was conducted with each participant and the General Health Questionnaire- 12 and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale- 10 were administered. Results: The results suggested that the psychological wellbeing <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> <b>living</b> in hostels was better than that <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> <b>living</b> alone, but that the psychological well-being <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> <b>living</b> with their family was not different from that <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> <b>living</b> alone. Conclusion: That the psychological well-being <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> in different <b>living</b> arrangements is different may be explained by the differences in time for leisure, access to social services, as well as changes in their attitude towards co-residence with children...|$|R

5|$|As the {{population}} expanded, {{some of these}} settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements. Perhaps ten per cent of {{the population}} lived {{in one of the}} burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They may have had a mean population of about 2,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} era, but many were much smaller than 1,000. During the seventeenth century, the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> in the capital grew rapidly.
