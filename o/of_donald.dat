5000|$|Fanny Coot is {{the mother}} <b>of</b> <b>Donald's</b> cousin Gus Goose and she was first {{mentioned}} in the Donald Duck comic strip of May 9, 1938 by Bob Karp & Al Taliaferro where Gus first appeared.

So she was originally sister <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>Donald's</b> parents. In Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree she is featured as a daughter of Casey Coot and his wife Gretchen Grebe, and so a niece <b>of</b> Elvira Coot, <b>Donald's</b> paternal grandmother, and first cousin <b>of</b> <b>Donald's</b> father, Quackmore Duck. It's possible to consider that Quackmore had a high regard for his cousin Fanny, and for this reason Donald was taught to treat her as aunt. Fanny also had a brother named Cuthbert Coot and she married Luke the Goose, and then became the mother of Gus Goose.|$|R
