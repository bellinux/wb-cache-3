5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|Susan hires Finn Kelly (Rob Mills), {{following}} Brad's departure. Susan {{learns that}} Elly and Finn used to date. Susan collapses and {{is taken to}} hospital, where it is discovered {{that she has a}} high level of opiates in her system. It emerges that her vitamins have been swapped and Elly suspects that Finn was responsible. Finn is appointed acting principal while Susan recovers. When Finn's crimes are exposed, including the vitamin swap, Susan ignores her MS symptoms to return to the school to undo everything Finn implemented. Susan suffers an MS relapse and falls in the school yard. Karl persuades her to take sick leave and go to a retreat in Thailand. When they return, Susan is angry with Karl and later reveals that he tried to bring seeds and a Durian into the country, but was stopped at customs because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell,</b> which he blamed on her soiling herself.|$|E
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

30|$|Community-based {{contingency}} planning: {{to mitigate}} the prima-donnas and solution defiance smells, managers for “Integra” decided to: (a) make technical (e.g., architecture) and socio-technical (e.g., social or organisational structure changes) together; (b) use the appointed learning community as a device to generate “contingency plans” in case certain technical or socio-technical decisions lead to warning scenarios. This increased <b>the</b> cohesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community and reportedly hampered <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomones—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E

25|$|The CBSA uses passive {{detector}} dogs, {{unlike some}} {{other law enforcement}} agencies, which use active dogs. When a passive dog detects a scent {{that it has been}} trained to recognize, it sits beside the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> While active dogs, which bark, scratch, dig or bite at the source of the scent, were used initially by the CBSA, passive dogs allow the officer to circulate among passengers more peacefully, and are considered by the Agency to be more effective {{in the course of their}} work. The Passive Dog training was implemented in 1993, and is now the Agency's preference.|$|E

30|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{findings}} <b>of</b> {{this paper is}} that the tools accuracy varies mostly depending on <b>the</b> code <b>smell</b> being analyzed. A higher recall captures most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected entities providing a good coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> present in <b>the</b> system. On the other hand, higher precisions reduce the validation effort by reporting less false positives. Considering all <b>smells,</b> for MobileMedia <b>the</b> average recall varies from 0 to 58 % and the average precision from 0 to 100 %, while for Health Watcher the variations are 0 to 100 % and 0 to 85 %, respectively. The overall agreement among tools varies from 83 to 98 % considering all smells in both systems. Between pairs <b>of</b> tools, <b>the</b> overall agreement varies from 67 to 100 %. A closer analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results revealed that the high agreement is when classes and methods do not present code smells. Regarding our secondary study on <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> code <b>smells,</b> we found that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> code <b>smells</b> in both systems originate with the class or method creation. That {{is the case for}} 74.4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> in MobileMedia and 87.5 % in Health Watcher, confirming <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> Tufano et al. (2015). Another observation is that <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>smells</b> does not necessarily grow with <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, even though there was an increase of 2057 lines of code in MobileMedia and of 2706 lines of code in Health Watcher.

2500|$|Acceptability {{of outdoor}} {{urination}} {{in a public}} place other than at a public urinal varies with the situation and with customs. Potential disadvantages include a dislike <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of urine, and some exposure of genitals. The latter can be unpleasant for the one who exposes them (modesty, lack of privacy) and/or those who can see them; [...] it can be avoided or mitigated by going to a quiet place and/or facing a tree or wall if urinating standing up, or while squatting, hiding the back behind walls, bushes, or a tree.|$|E
2500|$|... {{government}} authorities {{claimed that}} smoking cannabis could cause nervous dysfunction and madness. Such official attitudes must have reflected popular beliefs, since very little concrete evidence exists concerning {{the use of}} cannabis even in the large coastal metropoles. In Shanghai not a single case of cannabis use was discovered during the 1930s. With {{the exception of the}} Uyghurs, the popular perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of smoked cannabis as 'foul' (chou) also impeded its spread. On the other hand, the extraction of hemp oil was widespread in Shanxi, Mongolia and Manchuria. Although most of it appears to have been used for lighting and to lubricate cart wheels, its narcotic powers may have been understood by the local farmers.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, raw pu'er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow {{oxidation}} and other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not {{analogous to}} the oxidation that results in green, oolong, or black tea, because the process is not catalyzed by the plant's own enzymes but rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu'er flavors can change dramatically {{over the course of}} the aging process, resulting in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of rich garden soil or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with roasted or sweet undertones. Because of its ability to age without losing [...] "quality", well aged good pu'er gains value over time in the same way that aged roasted oolong does.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{comparison}} <b>of</b> code <b>smell</b> detection tools is {{a difficult}} task because these tools are based on informal definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells.</b> <b>The</b> different interpretations <b>of</b> code smell by researchers and developers lead to tools with distinct detection techniques, results, and consequently, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> time spent with validation. In this paper, we used MobileMedia and Health Watcher as target systems, to evaluate the accuracy and <b>the</b> agreement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tools inFusion, JDeodorant, JSpIRIT, and PMD. The accuracy was measured by calculating the recall and <b>the</b> precision <b>of</b> tools in detecting <b>the</b> code <b>smells</b> from <b>the</b> reference list. The agreement was measured by calculating the overall agreement and the AC 1 statistic considering all tools simultaneously and between pairs of tools.|$|R

The girls had been missing for 13 days when their bodies were found, with police stating that both corpses were [...] "severely decomposed and partially skeletonised". Their bodies were discovered by local gamekeeper Keith Pryer, who had noticed [...] "an unusual and unpleasant smell" [...] in the area several days earlier, and when returning to the area he had decided to investigate the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> Within a week, by which time DNA tests confirmed that the bodies were definitely those of the two missing girls, it was established at an inquest in Cambridge that the girls had almost certainly not died at the location where their bodies were found, and had instead been murdered at another location before their bodies were placed there.|$|E
2500|$|By 1910, {{increased}} interest in a zoo brought together some concerned citizens, and they organized the Zoological Society of St. Louis. In 1914, it was incorporated as an independent civic organization of people interested in a zoo. [...] Meanwhile, the citizens of St. Louis and surrounding municipalities expressed diverse opinions as to the appropriate location of a zoo if there should be one. Fairground Park, Carondolet Park, the Creve Coeur area, and Tower Grove Park {{were some of the}} places suggested in newspaper articles and letters to the editors and to civic groups. Some concerned citizens residing near Oakland Avenue, south of Forest Park, expressed their displeasure with a zoo in the park because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the animals. The zoo initially held 51 deer and antelope, 11 buffaloes, a sacred cow, a sandhill crane, 20 prairie dogs, a dromedary camel, eagles, ducks, elk, foxes, geese, swans, rabbits, a raccoon, a China sheep, opossums, a buzzard, owls, peafowl, among other animals. The head of the Parks Department, Dwight Davis, voiced his opinion against Forest Park—that is, until the city set aside [...] in the park in which to establish a zoological park. A five-man board was appointed to act as the Zoological Board of Control.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 1792 Gustav III was murdered. Sophia Magdalena was {{reportedly}} shocked and {{horrified by the}} murder. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority. As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles. Directly after she was told of the murder, Sophia Magdalena sent for the kings favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took {{the hands of the}} King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: [...] "How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!" [...] She was kept informed if his state by Armfelt, but she was kept from visiting him because further Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room.|$|E

30|$|Social Debt’s {{existence}} is heralded by organisational and social anti-patterns (i.e., community “smells”) which are emerging and recurring across the community - As evident from Figure 1 the “Socio-Technical Decision” class is in a causal relationship with “Community Smell”. Also, {{according to our}} evidence, the times at which this causality was reported are antecedent to <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> sub-optimal organisational structures. For example in our case study of “Integra” we found a pattern of behaviour recurring in subsequent periods of time and a consequent suboptimal characteristic, “communication delays”. We defined this pattern as the “radio-silence” community “smell”, that is, a recurring delay (a few hours to half a day) in answering sometimes critical emails or posts. <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> {{is connected to the}} previously reported “extraneous colleagues” characteristic. Communication was relying solely on the “kindness-of-strangers” effect. Although the delay may seem small enough, its compounding effect across the community produced a non-trivial delay.

The narrator recounts various episodes of entertainment, including reading, hunting, visiting native villages and capturing an electric eel. Oroonoko and Imoinda live {{as husband and wife}} in their own slave cottage; when she becomes pregnant, Oroonoko petitions for their return to the homeland. After being put off with vague promises of the governor's arrival, Oroonoko organizes a slave revolt. The slaves, including Imoinda, fight valiantly, but the majority [...] are compelled to surrender when deputy governor Byam promises them amnesty. When the slaves surrender, Oroonoko and Tuscan, his second-in-command, are punished and whipped, by their former allies, at the command of Byam. To avenge his honor, Oroonoko vows to kill Byam. He predicts that this act would make Imoinda vulnerable to subjugation and rape after his death. [...] The noble couple decides that he should kill her, and Imoinda proudly dies by his hand.

The prosecution's [...] "grooming" [...] theory held that Jackson used alcohol to lower Gavin's inhibitions in order to molest him, and the accuser testified that the first time he was molested, he and Jackson had just come [...] "back from drinking in the arcade." [...] He also described a time when he was undergoing urine tests related to his cancer treatment, and he worried alcohol would be detected, but was allegedly pressured by Jackson to drink anyway and not take the test.

[...] However, Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant who had served Jackson on the Miami flight and other flights, testified that she never saw him share his drink with Gavin. She testified that she had devised the custom of serving Jackson wine in Diet Coke cans during flights, because Michael Jackson didn't like to drink alcohol in front of his children.|$|E
