In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E

25|$|By 8 May 1946, {{the first}} anniversary of VE Day, he was presumed officially dead for the purpose of probate, though the {{substantive}} assumption of death was delayed until October 1946. However, although he had died intestate Skepper had left a ‘soldier’s will’ and his estate was administered on 18 January 1948, with the administration document simply saying that he had died ‘on war service’. His whole estate was valued at £38,035 18s 2d (a huge sum for that time) and his mother then informed the London School of Economics that he had said that in the event of his death, at least part of this should be used for the furtherance <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> School. A bequest of £20,000 (currently worth approximately £500,000-£700,000) was made via a deed of trust, for ‘Sociological Research at the School’ by the establishment of The Charles Skepper House for Sociological Research with a Research Fellowship and Studentships.

500|$|The first formal Department of Sociology in {{the world}} was {{established}} by Albion Small - at the invitation of William Rainey Harper - at the University of Chicago in 1892, and the American Journal of Sociology was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well. However, the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical social research. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method (1895). For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the [...] "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning".|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 1998, Houston Police Department {{officers}} {{acting on}} a tip regarding drug related activities entered a Gulfton apartment complex and shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro. The circumstances of the event were disputed. By October 19 of that year a Harris County grand jury cleared the officers of charges related to the incident. Nestor Rodriguez, a professor <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Houston, described Gulfton as [...] "a place where people are just struggling to get by." [...] Consequently, there were fewer [...] "displays of outrage" [...] than would have been expected if the incident had occurred {{in one of the}} [...] "older, well-established Latino communities." [...] Oregon's killing was controversial because illicit drugs were not found on the property. Oregon's family sued the City of Houston arguing that the raid was inappropriate. The city countered that its officers acted in an appropriate manner. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2000.|$|E
500|$|The {{city-state}} of Hamburg set up {{a full-time}} office dedicated to opposing Scientology, the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority, {{under the leadership of}} Ursula Caberta. In 2005, in a case brought by a Scientologist, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community, finding that the practice infringed religious freedom. In June 2008, the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ($7,000) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of [...] "sect filters." [...] Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available. Eileen Barker, a professor <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> London School of Economics, has noted that [...] "Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists." [...] The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.|$|E

500|$|The first {{college course}} {{entitled}} [...] "Sociology" [...] was {{taught in the}} United States at Yale in 1875 by William Graham Sumner. In 1883 Lester F. Ward, {{the first president of}} the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology—Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of Herbert Spencer and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department <b>of</b> <b>Sociology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 (along with John Dewey), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern Chicago School. The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1905. The sociological [...] "canon of classics" [...] with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by Marxism than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.|$|E
