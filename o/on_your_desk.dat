Busta Rhymes is {{featured}} on one remix, to which BET Sound Off preferred to the original version, commenting, [...] "Not that I don’t appreciate Keri and Weezy’s version because it’s actually a snazzy lil ditty, but Busta’s ambiance over Polow’s sound scape gives me a different vibe, that 'stand <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> and mean mug everyone in your office who tells you to turn down your music' vibe." [...] In January 2010, a remix featuring T.I. was released. A MSTRKRFT remix of the original version was released on iTunes.|$|E

50|$|Momentary forgetting, such as forgetting {{what you}} wanted to get from the kitchen after getting up from <b>your</b> <b>desk,</b> is {{frequently}} experienced in day-to-day life. Usually what was forgotten can be remembered again by returning to the context where the event began. For example, imagine sitting at <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> and deciding {{you want to get a}} drink from the kitchen. Once you get to the kitchen, you completely forget {{what you wanted}} there. If you return to <b>your</b> <b>desk,</b> you will most likely remember what you wanted from the kitchen.|$|R

50|$|With SIP forking you {{can have}} <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> phone ring {{at the same time}} as your {{softphone}} or a SIP phone <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mobile. For example, you would use SIP forking to ring your deskphone and your Android SIP Phone at the same time, allowing you to take the call from either device easily. No forwarding rules would be necessary as both devices would ring. In the same manner SIP forking can be used in an office and allow the secretary to answer calls to the extension of his/her boss when he is away or unable to take the call.|$|R

When you have thus used one bunch, tie them up and lay the bunch on my desk to be mended, and then you can go on using the other bunch. This will give me opportunity to choose a convenient time to mend the first bunch again. When I have mended them, I will tie them up and lay them <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>desk</b> again. Thus you will always have a supply of pens, and I shall never be interrupted to mend one. This will be a great deal more convenient, both for you and for me." ...|$|E

"My dear Violet," [...] he said, [...] "you and I--or rather I, for {{you are not}} {{concerned}} in this--live a life {{which is a little}} different from the lives of most of the people around us.

I have weapons with which to fight any ordinary danger. What I want to explain to you is this--that if you hear no more of me, you can do nothing. If that note does not come to you in the morning, you can do nothing. Wait here for three days, and after that go back to England.
