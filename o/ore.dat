5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese <b>ore</b> {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese <b>ore</b> to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The <b>ore</b> then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the <b>ore</b> to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The <b>ore</b> is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese <b>ore</b> is mixed with iron <b>ore</b> and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese <b>ore</b> with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E

40|$|There are {{generally}} {{two types of}} copper <b>ores,</b> sulfide <b>ores</b> and oxide <b>ores.</b> Sulfide <b>ores</b> contain copper-bearing sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite, while oxide <b>ores</b> are composed {{of a variety of}} copper-bearing silicate, carbonate, sulfate or chloride minerals, including chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, brochantite and atacamite...|$|R
50|$|Sinter {{roasting}} involves {{heating the}} fine <b>ores</b> at high temperatures, where simultaneous oxidation and agglomeration of the <b>ores</b> take place. For example, lead sulfide <b>ores</b> {{are subjected to}} sinter roasting in a continuous process after froth flotation to convert the fine <b>ores</b> to workable agglomerates for further smelting operations.|$|R
40|$|The Caijiaying Zn-Au deposit {{is mainly}} hosted in Proterozoic {{high-grade}} metamorphic rocks with marble lenses, with minor <b>ores</b> in Jurassic volcanic cover rocks.

5|$|Mines in Labrador, {{the iron}} <b>ore</b> mine at Wabush/Labrador City, {{and the new}} nickel mine in Voisey's Bay {{produced}} a total of $2.5 billion worth of <b>ore</b> in 2006. A new mine at Duck Pond (30 kilometres (18mi) south of the now-closed mine at Buchans), started producing copper, zinc, silver and gold in 2007 and prospecting for new <b>ore</b> bodies continues. Mining accounted for 3.5% of the provincial GDP in 2006.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the research outcomes of a magnetic mineralogical study on Hamersley iron <b>ores.</b> Thermal magnetic analysis shows that typical high-grade martite-microplaty hematite or M- (mpl H) and martite-microplaty hematite-goethite or M-(mpl H) -g <b>ores</b> contain {{a small amount}} of original magnetite. A small amount of magnetite/maghemite and pyrite/pyrrhotite/siderite may exist in typical martite-goethite (M-G) and martite-ochreous goethite (M-oG) <b>ores.</b> In “the hardcap zone”, M-(H) -g <b>ores</b> contain {{a small amount of}} magnetite and maghemite.

5|$|The <b>ore</b> {{from the}} Marcellus varied in thickness, {{becoming}} unworkably thin, and even disappearing altogether in places between the workable beds. The {{quality of the}} <b>ore</b> also varied, {{and it was not}} always profitable to smelt, as several furnaces built near iron <b>ore</b> mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the <b>ore</b> and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{products}} of chromium <b>ore</b> refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the <b>ore</b> smelter process differs considerably. For {{the production of}} ferrochromium, the chromite <b>ore</b> (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.|$|E
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the <b>ore</b> and women and children picking and cobbing the <b>ore</b> ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken <b>ore</b> through a broad mesh to sort the <b>ore</b> ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of <b>ore</b> left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable <b>ore</b> from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted <b>ore</b> to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting <b>ore</b> between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken <b>ore</b> per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which <b>ore</b> could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled <b>ore</b> were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin <b>ore</b> from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|The Potosi Mine {{is located}} in the Moa-Baracoa massif in the easternmost part of the Cuban Ophiolitic Belt. Chromite {{mineralization}} occurs within the mantle-crust transition zone. Two events of magma intrusion overprint the chromitite bodies: one gave rise to the crystallization of pegmatitic olivine- norite dikes. and the other produced pegmatitic gabbro dikes. Sulfide-poor chromite <b>ores,</b> brecciated chromite <b>ores,</b> and sulfide-rich chromite <b>ores</b> can be distinguished in the different chromitite bodies. Sulfide-poor <b>ores</b> represent more than 80 vol% of the chromitites. This type occurs far from the zones intruded by pegmatitic gabbro dikes and shows petrographic and chemical features similar to other chromitite bodies described in the Moa-Baracoa massif. Brecciated chromite <b>ores</b> occur within pegmatitic gabbro dikes. In this type, chromite crystals occur included within chromian diopside and plagioclase. These silicates often contain droplet-like sulfide aggregates. Sulfide-rich <b>ores</b> are spatially associated to the contacts between sulfide-poor chromite and pegmatitic olivine- norite dikes. These <b>ores</b> mainly consist of recrystallized (coarse) chromite with interstitial pyrrhotite. pentlandite, cubanite. and chalcopyrite. Chromite from sulfiderich <b>ores</b> exhibits TiO 2, FeO, V 2 O 3, MnO, and especially, Fe 2 O 3 contents, higher than those of chromite from brecciated <b>ores</b> and much higher than those of chromite from sulfide-poor <b>ores.</b> The sulfide-rich <b>ores</b> are PGE-rich (up to 1, 113 ppb of total PGE), and show nearly flat chondrite-normalized PGE patterns, slightly above 0. 1 times chondritic values. Mineralogical and chemical data indicate that the chromite <b>ores</b> of the Potosi Mine were modified by the intrusions of olivine-norite and gabbro dikes. The interaction between preexisting sulfide-poor chromite <b>ores</b> and the intruding volatile-rich silicate melts produced strong brecciation, partial dissolution, and recrystallization (coarsening) of chromite. The sulfide assemblage formed by fractionation of the immiscible sulfide melt segregated from the volatile-rich silicate melt that generated the pegmatitic olivine-norite. The segregation of the sulfide melt can be interpreted as the consequence of chemical interaction between intruding melts and the host chromite. The variable extent of this interaction produced chromite <b>ores</b> with variable sulfide ratios. The magmatic nature of the sulfide mineralization is supported by sulfur isotope data, which range from - 0. 4 to + 0. 9 parts per thousand. Sulfide melt collected incompatible PGE (Rh, Pt, Pd) to produce the typical flat chondrite-normalized pattern of sulfide-rich chromite <b>ores...</b>|$|R
