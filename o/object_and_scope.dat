Attributes of thus understood space have a relatively different and distinctive ontological status and they refer to different characteristics of space but in very intensive, mutual relations. In the proposed theory they are interlinked and their characteristics show a high degree of synergy between "objects", "relations" and the "scope" of their attributes. Interactions of these attributes take place at various levels of reality; they change the character of attributes but maintain the general logic of mutual clarification and the explanatory power of the integrated theory of space where objects define relations, relations define <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> defines <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> relations...|$|R

40|$|Comparative experiments, {{in which}} {{subjects}} are randomized {{to one of}} two treatments, are performed often. There is no shortage of papers testing whether a treatment effect exists and providing confidence intervals for the magnitude of this effect. While it is well understood that the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of inference for an experiment will depend on what assumptions are made, these entities are not always clearly presented. We have proposed one possible method, which is based on the ideas of Jerzy Neyman, {{that can be used for}} constructing confidence intervals in a comparative experiment. The resulting intervals, referred to as Neyman-type confidence intervals, can be applied in a wide range of cases. Special care is taken to note which assumptions are made and what <b>object</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of inference are being investigated. We have presented a notation that highlights which parts of a problem are being treated as random. This helps ensure the focus on the appropriate scope of inference. The Neyman-type confidence intervals are compared to possible alternatives in two different inference settings: one in which inference is made about the units in the sample and one in which inference is made about units in a fixed population. A third inference setting, one in which inference is made about a process distribution, is also discussed. It is stressed that certain assumptions underlying this third type of inference are unverifiable. When these assumptions are not met, the resulting confidence intervals may cover their intended target well below the desired rate. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the Neyman-type intervals have good coverage properties when inference is being made about a sample or a population. In some cases the alternative intervals are much wider than necessary on average. Therefore, we recommend that researchers consider using our Neyman-type confidence intervals when carrying out inference about a sample or a population as it may provide them with more precise intervals that still cover at the desired rate...|$|E

The performance indicators for public tasks in the voivodeship budget, their functionality and informative value were evaluated. The performance budget of the governmental voivodeship administration in Poland is based on a set of several functions among which the following ones consume the largest amounts of expenditure: social security and support for the family, health service, public security and public order. Each function was attributed specific tasks which, in turn were divided into subtasks. The objectives of the tasks and subtasks and their performance indicators were formulated. The specific character of the Voivodeship Offices creates additional barriers for the optimal formulation of the public task performance indicators. On the one hand, the Voivodes implement the strategic policy of the government. On the other hand, they {{have to take into account}} the character and economic and social characteristics of the region. They also have to cooperate with the voivodeship self-government.

Furniture itself doesn’t show the life style and behavior pattern directly, but it has inherent feature of culture. If these features aren’t considered in the design process, the product cannot satisfy users. Hence, not only physical elements(form, color, material and structure) but immaterial elements(value, custom, life style and view of arts) {{should be considered in}} design process. It can produce result that fits to every cultural pattern and situation. And it can lead to create user-centered design that is the competitive power of furniture. European furniture designers borrow heavily from traditional Asian style and culture. This trend is accelerating in the new millennium. The fusion of Asian philosophy with the “rationalist ” design approach of the west is a fertile arena for original design. But very often, those “Asian ” styles incorporated into western furniture are not culturally specific and very often, this “assimilation ” ignores the broader and deeper origins of a particular style. This is why there is a pressing need for comparative and culturally oriented design studies. We need to better explore and differentiate various Asian design approaches and better understand the cultural/lifestyle precepts from which they arose.

The attendance of new media will rise new public. Many ways have been performed to maintain and also to attract new public as many as possible. Media institution start to compete in making its media online version. Online media is not only monopolizing media institution; government agencies also start to use this kind of media to satisfy public needs of information. As is done by local government of Malang Regency, besides it uses radio and magazine, it also uses online media to satisfy public needs of information. Each media institution certainly has redaction policy that individualizing it to another. Background of this research is the role played by online media in presenting information about Government of Malang regency on daily-basis. To become a media interested by public, online media still needs an improvement in its utilization, so that it completely becomes the main choice of public in accessing information, especially in governance field. On the background above, this research is meant to know how redaction policy of online media of Malang Regency government is. This research uses descriptive type, because it is digging information/knowledge about redaction policy of government online media. Research method is descriptive qualitative, that is an effort to dig and to collect information about redaction policy of online media of Malang Regency government. It uses interview, observation, and documentation as its data collecting technique. Sampling technique uses purposive sampling. And, data analysis technique processed in induction-interpretation-conceptualization. Data validation technique uses method triangulation and source triangulation. Research result of redaction policy on online media of Malang Regency Government includes policy of coverage object determination, pervasion scope determination, news reporter determination, and deadline determination. Redaction policy on online media of Malang Regency Government has different policy with other of media. Although, online media is fell within new media, but the policy applied by Malang Regency Government tends to use conventional media policy. The working way of this media in accumulating news differs from other media.

40|$|Despite {{great strides}} in {{enforcement}} of the cartel prohibition of article 81 EC and major merger control reform, EC competition law still lacks clear standards for anti-competitive abuses under article 82 EC. In a masterful engagement with this issue, the thoughtful and original analysis in this book focuses on tying and bundling. Although these ubiquitous business practices are primarily addressed under article 82 EC as constituting abusive behavior, a wealth of economics literature emphasizes their strategic and efficiency motivations. However, there is a balance to be found, as this book ably demonstrates. In {{the course of the}} analysis, the author zeroes in on such central questions as the following: [...] What tests are available to determine whether two products are distinct or not? [...] Under which circumstances is anti-competitive leveraging feasible? [...] Which efficiency motivations should be accepted? [...] How does one valuate the possible efficiencies in the short run and the risk of leveraging effects in the long run? [...] What factors should be considered when answering the separate product issue? [...] What are the implications for the burden of proof under article 82 EC? [...] Does the application of a more effects-based approach under article 82 also affect the dominance analysis? In his examination of the various responses to these probing questions, the author is able to formulate a very useful diagnosis of what factors determine whether a tied or bundled entity is likely to engender anti-competitive effects. The presentation is supported throughout by detailed reference to relevant legal-economic doctrine, laws, and judicial interpretation by European and U. S. courts, the European Commission, and antitrust agencies. In its development of effects-based tests for assessing tying and bundling practices, this important book will be of special value to policymakers and regulatory officials involved in enforcement of EC or Member State competition law. It will also be welcomed by academics in both law and economics as a truly cogent and workable approach to the solution {{of one of the most}} vital and intriguing debates in the antitrust field.

The court would have to have regard to the facts of case and to apply ordinary, common-sense standards in determining whether or not there existed a causal connection between the damage and the driving sufficiently real and close to enable it to say that the death or injury had [...] "arisen out of" [...] the driving.|$|R

As a fragmented {{use of the term}} “Web personalization ” and a lack of a common framework potentially hinder the establishment of a cumulative body of research, we develop a taxonomy of Web personalization. Bringing together research from information systems, computer science, and marketing, we develop a taxonomy focusing on the meta-characteristics user modeling (with the dimensions type of data, acquisition method, and life span of data) and system adaptation (with the dimensions <b>object,</b> volatility, <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> control of adaptation). We demonstrate an application of our taxonomy by analyzing a sample of articles published in premier information systems journals and present some exemplary use cases to demonstrate how the taxonomy could be applied in practical contexts...|$|R

In {{the main focus of}} this research there is a subject <b>and</b> <b>object</b> <b>scope</b> of control. There has been stated the author’s vision of the subject <b>and</b> <b>object</b> of the control institute, their structure, composition, and the relationship between them have been determined. We prove the equivalence of the notions “institute of control” and “state financial control”. It has been pointed out that only public resources, actions, etc. are used in the subject scope of the state financial control. The essential features of the notion “institute of control” having been determined by means of institutional analysis made it possible to step down from the abstract to the concrete chain of interrelated notions. The mechanism of the formation of the institute of control as a social norm has been studied at both informal and informal levels. At the informal level there is restrictive framework created to prevent treating public funds as personal. At the formal level, the Institute of control acquires established patterns {{in the form of the}} state financial control and its systems. There has been demonstrated that filling institute of control and its agents with the formal content is carried through administrative or legislative actions of the state. У статті, в межах формування системного уявлення про контрольну функцію фінансів та її реалізацію в економіці, розглянуто ланцюг понять: «інститут контролю» - «агент інституту контролю» - «предметно-об’єктна сфера інституту контролю», виходячи з неформального та формального змісту. У основному фокусі дослідження – предметно-об’єктна сфера контролю. Сформульовано авторське бачення предмета та об’єкта інституту контролю, розкрито їх структура, склад, а також взаємозв’язок між ними. Доведено еквівалентність понять «інститут контролю» та «державний фінансовий контроль». Акцентовано, що для предметної сфери державного фінансового контролю застосовується лише публічні ресурси, дії тощо. Розкриття поняття «інститут контролю» методами інституційного аналізу дало змогу здійснити сходження від абстрактного до конкретного досліджуваного ланцюга...|$|R

Poland’s integration with the European Union will intensify the impact that these changes have on Poland. A few changes in self-government activities are also required, so that Poland can take possibly the biggest advantage of the oncoming opportunities and effectively eschew or ward off dangers. The changes in question must relate to both their <b>object</b> <b>and</b> the <b>scope,</b> the forms <b>and</b> methods as well as tools and measures. The nature of changes {{can be summed up}} into the four following suppositions: 1. restructuring the main functions of local government, whereby the management function will gain more importance, while the direct, executive function will be curbed. 2. the main direction of change: the economy based on knowledge and the development of information society beside the more traditional branches of the economy, which should nevertheless have appropriate conditions for modernisation, 3. an increase in the importance of quality in life and in the economy, 4. particular concern about sustained development (harmonisation of all areas of socio- -economic life) with respect of regional and local values. The changes stated above should be accompanied by creating new social behaviour, stimulating activity, and creating a society open to the world and the challenges of the future, {{but at the same time}} cherishing traditions and culture, which are the foundations of its identity and sovereignty. All those factors contribute to the creation of a civil society. The proposed changes in the activity of local governments are hardly revolutionary measures, they rather form a greater change by evolution...|$|R
40|$|Proposed in {{this paper}} is a neutral {{representation}} of design computational workflows which allows their exchange and sharing between different project partners and across design stages. This is achieved by the de-coupling of configuration and execution logic. Thus, the same underlying workflow can be executed with different (fidelity) models and different software tools {{as long as the}} inputs and outputs of the constituent process are kept the same. To this purpose, an object model is proposed to define different simulation <b>objects,</b> their <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> hierarchy in the simulation process. An XML based computer readable representation of workflows based on the proposed object model, is also suggested. The application of the proposed representation is demonstrated via a case study involving the exchange of workflows between two design partners. The case study also demonstrates how the same workflow can be executed using different execution tools and involving different fidelity models...|$|R

No serious research can dispense with modelling {{as a means to}} reach the essential and to evaluate the divergence between singular geographical <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> the models that assist their interpretation. On two conditions, which merit further definition and exploration : models must have meaning in and through the practices, objectives and intentions of human action ; and we must know how to use models—whether tried and tested or new—to understand the structure and dynamics of singular geographical <b>objects,</b> <b>and</b> not just to infer general mechanisms from them, even though they will certainly enhance our understanding of the nature <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of general mechanisms...|$|R
