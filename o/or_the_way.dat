He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth, 1600), in which Gilbert described his experiments which led {{to the conclusion that the}} Earth was magnetic, and introduced the term electricus to describe the phenomenon of static electricity produced by rubbing amber (called ēlectrum in Classical Latin, derived from ήλεκτρον (elektron) in Ancient Greek). According to the mathematician and physician Mark Ridley, chapter 12 of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how astronomical observations could be used to determine the magnetic variation, was actually Wright's work.|$|E

It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in the churches of many Western Christian denominations, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic.|$|E

25|$|According to Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud, in his Sefer HaQabbalah, the Karaite {{movement}} crystallized in Baghdad in the Gaonic period (circa 7th–9th centuries) {{under the}} Abbasid Caliphate {{in what is}} present-day Iraq. This is the view universally accepted among Rabbinic Jews. But, some Arab scholars (see cites) claim that Karaites were already living in Egypt {{in the first half}} of the 7th century, based on a legal document that the Karaite community in Egypt had in its possession until the end of the 19th century, in which the first Islamic governor ordered the leaders of the Rabbinite community against interfering with Karaite practices <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they celebrate their holidays.

500|$|Foo Fighters earned mostly {{positive}} reviews upon release. Many critics {{compared the}} album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear {{it in the way}} Nevermind taught us to hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E
500|$|Joplin's {{usage of}} Italian tempo {{indications}} in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] {{has been interpreted}} as his intention to give the piece a serious aspect {{in a similar manner}} to Treemonisha and [...] "Scott Joplin's New Rag". [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] begins with the instruction [...] "Allegretto ma non troppo" [...] (moderately fast, but not too much) and continues in the D strain with [...] "Tempo l'istesso" [...] (tempo remains the same), a warning against slowing down for the minor-mode section. As well, Joplin employed in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] the classic [...] "common time" [...] 4/4 time signature instead of the more usual 2/4 time of rag tunes. Simultaneously, Joplin doubled all the note values, effectively making the unusual 4/4 time signature have no practical effect on the way the piece sounded <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was performed. His publishing it in 4/4 was simply a way to connect the rag with classical and popular piano works of prior fame. Since Joplin published [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] himself, {{it has been suggested that}} the composition fully reflected his wishes and contained no compromises.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right.

[...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work.

500|$|Although he {{normally}} hates clip shows, David Mirkin {{liked this}} episode {{because of the}} singing and dancing and called the clips [...] "truly wonderful".

The only one missing really is [...] "Dr Zaius" [...] from [...] "A Fish Called Selma".

500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited that we got Ringo Starr coming in to do the show and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. We were given a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when he shows up in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he showed up with a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E
