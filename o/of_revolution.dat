Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E

50|$|In the Indian astronomical tradition, a Yuga is {{a period}} {{consisting}} of 1,577,917,500 civil days. Saturn makes 146,564 revolutions and Mars makes 229,6824 revolutions in a Yuga. So Saturn makes 146,564/1,577,917,500 = 36,641/394,479,375 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue <b>of</b> the <b>revolution</b> <b>of</b> Saturn is x, what is meant is that the fractional number <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> is x/394,479,375. Similarly, Mars makes 229,6824/1,577,917,500 = 190,412/131,493,125 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue <b>of</b> the <b>revolution</b> <b>of</b> Mars is y, what is meant is that the fractional number <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> is y/131,493,125.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, Philippine ports {{opened to}} world trade and shifts started {{occurring}} within Filipino society.

The ideals <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> also began to spread through the islands. Criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{analyzes the}} topic <b>of</b> <b>revolutions,</b> primarily its theoretical use. In introduction, there is explained for which events the word revolution is ordinarily used {{and in what}} sense {{the author of this}} work uses the term. In first chapter thesis outlines the emergence <b>of</b> the word <b>revolution</b> in ancient times and also understanding of the word by contemporaries. There is also analysis of the shift in using <b>of</b> the word <b>revolution</b> as the result of American and French revolutions. Second chapter aims on first theorists <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> in 19 th century with focus on Karl Marx, Alexis De Tocqueville and Vladimir Iljič Lenin. In third chapter author summarizes the development of the study <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> between world wars and in fourth, there is analysis of the study <b>of</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> after World War II. In that time revolutions were in the centre of attention of researchers in the field of social sciences. Fifth chapter deals with European revolutionary process as set forth by Martin Malia.

5|$|The {{semi-major axis}} of an {{asteroid}} {{is used to}} describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located at positions where their period <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice in November 1918, Strachwitz was repatriated and {{returned}} to a Germany in civil turmoil. He travelled to Berlin via Konstanz, at the Swiss–German border, and Munich. On his journey he saw many former German soldiers whose military discipline had broken down. Unable to tolerate this situation and fearing a Communist revolution, he travelled on to Berlin, arriving at the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof where he was met by a friend. Strachwitz had called ahead asking his friend to bring him his Gardes du Corps uniform, which he put on immediately. Berlin {{was in a state}} <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> The newly established provisional government under the leadership of Chancellor Friedrich Ebert was threatened by the Spartacist uprising of the German Revolution, whose ambition was a Soviet-style proletarian dictatorship. Ebert ordered the former soldiers, organized in Freikorps (paramilitary organizations) among them Strachwitz, to attack the workers and put down the uprising.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s Notosusanto wrote extensively, {{focusing}} on essays but also writing poems and, later, short stories; {{the last of}} his creative works were written around 1956. He published four short story anthologies between 1958 and 1963. The first, Hudjan Kepagian (Morning Rain), consisted of six short stories. It dealt with the struggle against the Dutch colonists during the revolution. His second anthology, Tiga Kota (Three Cities), was published the following year and followed events in three cities: Rembang, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta. The others, and his numerous stories which were published outside of anthologies, mostly dealt with the war and the positive effects <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E

5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order <b>of</b> <b>Revolution</b> was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The large scale mobilization of the Reds {{began in the late}} evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E

I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
