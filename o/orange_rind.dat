5000|$|Buccellati, in Sicilian, {{literally}} [...] "little bracelets" [...] {{are uniquely}} Sicilian fig cookies of a sweet dough rolled out {{and filled with}} figs as well as numerous other ingredients. The ingredients are {{as varied as the}} names the cookies are called by, apparently a function of the town or region in which they are made. In most of Sicily (as in most Sicilian-American homes) they are called [...] "cucciddati". They often include dates or date paste, and [...] "cucciddati" [...] could be interpreted as [...] "date cookies". Other towns call them [...] "nucciddati" [...] (nut cookies), [...] "zucciddati", [...] "ucciddati", [...] "vucciddati" [...] and as in Serradifalco, pucciddati. That town's version includes ground figs and dates, nuts, and <b>orange</b> <b>rinds.</b> The rolls are either cut into short tubes, or curved around to form a [...] "bracelet".|$|R

It is {{suitable}} for slicing, and characterised by an <b>orange</b> coloured <b>rind.</b> The cheese has been produced at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium since 1953. It is matured in the abbey cellars where the even temperature of 12 C and the 95% humidity favour the micro-organisms that transform the raw curd into cheese.|$|R
50|$|Cup fungi grow in {{peculiar}} shapes, frequently resembling cups or saucers. For example, {{the orange}} peel fungus (Aleuria aurantia) resembles a discarded <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> They may be vividly colored, like the scarlet cup (Sarcoscypha coccinea), {{which is often}} {{one of the first}} signs of spring where it grows. According to one 2008 estimate, the family contains 31 genera and 230 species.|$|E
5000|$|The Scottish city of Dundee {{has a long}} {{association}} with marmalade. [...] James Keiller and his wife Janet ran a small sweet and preserves shop in the Seagate area of Dundee. In 1797, they opened a factory to produce [...] "Dundee Marmalade", a preserve distinguished by thick chunks of bitter Seville <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> The business prospered, and remains a signature marmalade producer today.|$|E
50|$|At the {{resolution}} of the Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft (around several m per pixel), much of the northern plains has a distinctly stippled, pitted texture that causes the ground to resemble the surface of a basketball or <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> This texture is likely caused by a mantle of ice and dust covering the landscape. The small hollows and pits formed as the ice evaporated (sublimed).|$|E
2500|$|The dextro-form, S-(+)-carvone is {{obtained}} practically pure by the fractional distillation of caraway oil. The levo-form {{obtained from the}} oils containing it usually requires additional treatment to produce high purity R-(−)-carvone. This {{can be achieved by}} the formation an addition compound with hydrogen sulfide, from which carvone may be regenerated by treatment with potassium hydroxide in ethanol and then distilling the product in a current of steam. Carvone may be synthetically prepared from limonene via limonene nitrosochloride which may be formed by treatment of limonene with isoamyl nitrite in glacial acetic acid. This compound is then converted into carvoxime, which can be achieved by refluxing with DMF in isopropanol. Refluxing [...] carvoxime with 5% oxalic acid yields carvone. This procedure affords R-(−)-carvone from R-(+)-limonene. [...] The major use of d-limonene is as a precursor to S-(+)-carvone. [...] The large scale availability of <b>orange</b> <b>rinds,</b> a byproduct in the production of orange juice, has made limonene cheaply available, and synthetic carvone correspondingly inexpensively prepared.|$|R
50|$|The orange {{fruit is}} an {{important}} agricultural product, used for both the juicy fruit pulp and the aromatic peel (<b>rind).</b> <b>Orange</b> blossoms (the flowers) are used in several different ways, as are the leaves and wood of the tree.|$|R

5000|$|It is a {{typically}} autumnal dessert, {{made by a}} dough of chestnut, water, olive oil, pine nuts, and raisins, and baked. Local variations may include other ingredients, such as rosemary, <b>orange</b> <b>rind,</b> fennel seeds, and other dried fruit. There are also variations on {{the thickness of the}} cake, and specific names are sometimes used locally to refer to such variations. For example, in Livorno, a castagnaccio 3 centimeters thick is called [...] "toppone".|$|E
5000|$|In French cuisine, à la zingara (lit. [...] "gypsy style"), {{sometimes}} spelled as à la singara, is a garnish or sauce {{consisting of}} chopped ham, tongue, {{mushrooms and truffles}} combined with tomato sauce, tarragon and sometimes madeira. Additional ingredients may include white wine, cayenne pepper, lemon juice and <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> The sauce is prepared by cooking the ingredients until the mixture reduces and thickens. This garnish is served with meat such as veal, poultry and sometimes eggs.|$|E
50|$|Ventricina {{is a type}} of mildly spicy sausage {{made the}} area in and around Crognaleto. Ground pork is mixed with prosciutto crudo and other spices which {{typically}} include salt and pepper, bell peppers, peperoncini (dried hot peppers), garlic and rosemary. Fennel seeds and <b>orange</b> <b>rind</b> are sometimes added to this mixture which is then encased in the pig’s intestines or stomach before aging. Ventricina is often spread on bread and is sometimes placed on the grill or in the oven to make a form of bruschetta.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century Arabic's {{literature}} and Arab history {{accounts of the}} period Safarberlik became a synonym for the famous famine that overran Greater Syria, especially Mont Lebanon, in 1916 during World War I. The Syrian journalist Abd al-Ghani al-Utri in his book I’tirafat Shami ‘atiq; sira dhattyya wa suwar dimashqiyya (translated: Confessions of an old Damascene, Biography and Damascene pictures) suggests that Syrians have sanctified bread even since the Great War. The diary of a Palestinian Ottoman soldier, Ihsan Turjman, during WWI clearly describes the scarcity of foodstuffs and the overpricing sugar, rice and grains.Novelists, journalists, and playwrights used the oral accounts of those who lived and experienced WWI, and the miseries of Safarberlik that they described to produce an impressive body of literary and drama production. Safarberlik scenes report on the miserable circumstances people lived through. In al-Ghazzi’s book Shirwal Barhum (translated: The Pants of Barhum), during Safarberlik people were depicted as fighting over lemon and <b>orange</b> <b>rinds</b> while children pick watermelon rinds from the mud. Siham Turjman tells the account of her mother who was then 14 years old and tells that during the Safarberlik everything was expensive, people would line {{up in front of}} the bakery at midnight to buy the following morning coal-like, burnt, and overpriced bread.|$|R
50|$|The tree may fruit after {{as little}} as two years. The fruits are smooth spheres about an inch in {{diameter}} with a thin yellow, <b>orange</b> or red <b>rind</b> around a white pulp. They are edible and have an appealing sweet and sour taste. It is usually eaten out of hand, though {{can be used for}} drinks, jams and jellies.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{traditional}} methods of preparation, honeycombs are crushed, and the balls of wax containing 20-30% of honey are collected in generic containers. In the days immediately after all the honey extract has settled, the remaining combs containing honey and pollen are dipped in hot water (~ 50 °C), so that the water dissolves all the honey still present in the combs. At this point, any remaining lumps of wax and pollen are broken up {{through the use of}} a suitable mixer or by hand. The remaining wax is then pressed further to squeeze out any remaining liquid and is then stored in appropriate containers. The remaining liquid from the previous step is filtered, for example with a linen cloth, at least twice, and then placed in a suitable high-capacity boiler (sometimes made of copper) where it is boiled and concentrated via decoction. During this concentration process, finely cut lemon or <b>orange</b> <b>rinds</b> are added, and any impurities on the surface of the liquid are removed. The content of the boiler becomes gradually syrupy and must be kept in constant motion to prevent the product from sticking on the bottom and developing a smokey flavour. The liquid also becomes caramelized, becoming dark like molasses but much more complex, with a toasty flavour that has hints of coffee and caramel. When the liquid assumes a consistency similar to that of honey, the heating is interrupted, and the boiler is deposited in a secluded place and allowed to cool before the abbamele is drained.|$|R

5000|$|Struffoli ( [...] ; struffule [...] ) is a Neapolitan dish made of {{deep fried}} balls of dough {{about the size}} of marbles. Crunchy on the outside and light inside, struffoli are mixed with honey and other sweet ingredients. There are many {{different}} ways to dress them, but the traditional way is to mix them in honey with diavulilli (nonpareils sprinkles), cinnamon, and bits of <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> In Calabria they are also known as scalilli, and in Abruzzi cicerchiata. They are often served at Christmas and are sometimes served warm.|$|E
50|$|Muenster is pale {{in color}} and smooth in texture with an <b>orange</b> <b>rind.</b> The cheese is made from cow's milk. The rind's orange color is from annatto, a sweet and nutty {{seasoning}} used to add flavor and color to cheeses such as Cheddar, Colby, Red Leicester, and Mimolette. Muenster usually has a very mild flavor and smooth, soft texture. In some cases, when properly aged, it can develop a strong flavor with a pungent aroma. This cheese is commonly served as an appetizer. Because it melts well, it is also often used in dishes such as grilled cheese sandwiches, tuna melts, quesadillas, cheeseburgers, macaroni and cheese, and pizza.|$|E
5000|$|The tangor (C. reticulata × C. sinensis) is a {{citrus fruit}} hybrid of the {{mandarin}} orange (tangerine, Citrus reticulata) {{and the sweet}} orange (Citrus sinensis). The name [...] "tangor" [...] is a formation from the [...] "tang" [...] of tangerine and the [...] "or" [...] of [...] "orange". Also called the temple <b>orange,</b> its thick <b>rind</b> is easy to peel and its bright orange pulp is sour-sweet and full-flavoured.|$|R
40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} with one week old {{one hundred and fifty}} Anak broiler chickens to assess the nutritive potentials of sun dried sweet <b>orange</b> (Citrus sinensis) <b>rind</b> (SOR). They were randomly assigned to five dietary groups in which rind replaced maize at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 % levels in both starter and finisher diets. Each group had thirty broilers and replicated thrice. The birds were fed ad libitum for a nine-week period during which performance indices and carcass cuts and organs were evaluated. Experimental diets had no significant effect (p> 0. 05) on feed intake, body weight gain, water consumption, water: feed ratio, feed conversion ratio and feed cost per broiler while final live weight was affected significantly (p< 0. 05). Increasing dietary SOR content beyond 15 % reduced growth rate, which cumulatively caused a decrease in final live weight. Diets had significant effect only thigh+drumstick and the abdominal fat, and the dressing percentage values of broilers on the SOR diets were higher those on the control. The liver of chickens on the 20 % SOR replacement treatment manifested hypoplasia. The study has shown that dried SOR can be used to replace dietary maize in the diet of broilers at 15 % level...|$|R
60|$|The wild banana is {{a native}} of the Malay region, {{according}} to De Candolle, who has produced by far the most learned and unreadable work on the origin of domestic plants ever yet written. (Please don't give me undue credit for having heroically read it through out of pure love of science: I was one of its unfortunate reviewers.) The wild form produces seed, and grows in Cochin China, the Philippines, Ceylon, and Khasia. Like most other large tropical fruits, it no doubt owes its original development to the selective action of monkeys, hornbills, parrots and other big fruit-eaters; and it shares with all fruits of similar origin one curious tropical peculiarity. Most northern berries, like the strawberry, the raspberry, the currant, and the blackberry, developed by the selective action of small northern birds, can be popped at once into the mouth and eaten whole; they have no tough outer rind or defensive covering of any sort. But big tropical fruits, which lay themselves out for the service of large birds or monkeys, have always hard outer coats, because they could only be injured by smaller animals, who would eat the pulp without helping in the dispersion of the useful seeds, the one object really held in view by the mother plant. Often, {{as in the case of}} the <b>orange,</b> the <b>rind</b> even contains a bitter, nauseous, or pungent juice, while at times, as in the pine-apple, the prickly pear, the sweet-sop, and the cherimoyer, the entire fruit is covered with sharp projections, stinging hairs, or knobby protuberances, on purpose to warn off the unauthorised depredator. It was this line of defence that gave the banana in the first instance its thick yellow skin; and, looking at the matter from the epicure's point of view, one may say roughly that all tropical fruits have to be skinned before they can be eaten. They are all adapted for being cut up with a knife and fork, or dug out with a spoon, on a civilised dessert-plate. As for that most delicious of Indian fruits, the mango, it has been well said that the only proper way to eat it is over a tub of water, with a couple of towels hanging gracefully across the side.|$|R
