5000|$|Sociologists Blau and Duncan {{collected}} mobility data {{along with}} the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1962. The data included information on <b>occupational</b> <b>family</b> backgrounds. In 1962, 56.8% of sons with fathers who had occupations in upper nonmanual ended up with occupations in the same level. Only 1.2% of sons with fathers who had farming occupations ended up in upper nonmanual occupations. In 1973, these differences increased. 59.4% of sons with fathers in upper nonmanual occupations achieved occupations of this same level and 0.9% of sons with fathers in farming occupations ended up in upper nonmanual occupations. However, the occupational structure is more rigid towards the top and bottom. Those in lower nonmanual occupations, and upper and lower manual occupations {{were more likely to}} be vertically mobile. Upper nonmanual occupations have the highest level of occupational inheritance. [...] In the 1980s studies found that only 20 percent of the income gap persisted between generations in America, according to the Christian Science monitor. However, by 2003 improvements in econometrics showed that poverty could endure over several generations.|$|E

Less appreciated are the psychiatric conse-quences of NSIs, potentially including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disor-der (AD). Aims To study psychiatric consequences of NSIs by diagnosis, duration and severity of depressive symptoms. Methods Case control study from patients referred to a psychiatric trauma clinic diagnosed according to ICD- 10 diagnostic research criteria guidelines. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to measure depressive symptomatology and assess differences in depression severity between psy-chiatric trauma patients who had or had not experienced an NSI, and for relationships between the severity of depression and time since NSI using linear models. Results There were 17 NSI cases and 125 controls. NSI patients had moderately severe depressive symp-toms (mean BDI score 22. 7 15), which was similar to 125 non-NSI trauma patients. 13 of these 17 cases had AD and four had PTSD.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how {{aesthetic}} concepts of harmony and tension contribute to the vocational goals and perceptions of students preparing for child care work. 1 Nine students, recently or currently enrolled in <b>occupational</b> <b>family</b> and consumer sciences (FCS) child care programs and courses, were interviewed regarding their perceptions of harmony and tension in their schooling and work. Respondents indicated that they experience harmony in their love of children, enjoyment of teamwork, and personal mission to help children.

Although several participants briefly mentioned a desire for better wages and more respect from society, such tensions seemed to be accepted and not critically questioned.

40|$|<b>Occupational,</b> <b>family,</b> {{and social}} {{pressures}} {{have led to}} a society that sleeps less. In 1960, a survey by the American Cancer Society found that people slept, on average, 8 h per night. This figure has dropped today to 6. 7 h, a decrease of 15 % in less than one generation. This fall may be due to medical conditions, sleep disorders, or medications that inhibit sleep, as well as lifestyle disrupters such as jet lag, exam stress, or parenting infants. With the change toward a 24 -h society, working outside of the 9 -to- 5 day has also become increasingly prevalent. Shift workers commonly obtain less sleep than permanent daytime workers as daytime sleep is sacrificed to accommodate social, family, and leisure activities. Sleep deprivation causes between $ 43 billion and $ 56 billion worth of accidents annually, as well as contributing to a substantial number of injuries and deaths worldwide. Humans are biologically programmed to sleep at night, and going without sleep has a range of deleterious consequences for cognitive performance, health, and well-being. This article will first outline the methodologies used to investigate partial sleep deprivation in humans and animals and discuss the neurobehavioral, physiological, and psychosocial consequences of reduced sleep. The article will then describe the function of sleep stages, again summarizing methodologies and reviewing the findings from rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) selective sleep stage deprivation studies in humans and animals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo analyze gender inequalities in {{socioeconomic}} {{factors affecting}} {{the amount of}} time spent travelling for work-related and home-related reasons among working individuals aged between 30 and 44 years old during a weekday in Catalonia (Spain). MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were obtained from employed individuals aged between 30 and 44 years of age who reported travelling on the day prior to the interview in the Catalan Mobility Survey 2006 (N = 23, 424). Multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted to determine the factors associated with longer time spent travelling according to the reason for travelling (work- or home-related journeys). Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals are presented. ResultsA higher proportion of men travelled and spent more time travelling for work-related reasons, while a higher proportion of women travelled and spend more time travelling for home-related reasons. A higher educational level was associated with greater time spent travelling for work-related reasons in both men and women but was related to an increase in travelling time for home-related reasons only in men. In women, a larger household was associated with greater travel time for home-related reasons and with less travel time for work-related reasons. ConclusionThis study confirms the different mobility patterns in men and women, related to their distinct positions in the <b>occupational,</b> <b>family</b> and domestic spheres. Gender inequalities in mobility within the working population are largely determined by the greater responsibility of women in the domestic and family sphere. This finding should be taken into account in the design of future transport policies...|$|E

The method used to gather the data on which the paper is based was a questionnaire consisting of 72 multiple choice items. The questionnaire was divided into sections, each of which dealt respectively with the effects upon the ostomate's occupation, family life and social life. Answers to the questionnaire were provided by 63 members of the Ostomy Association of Los Angeles at two meetings held in Southern California in early 1979. There is included in the thesis {{a review of the literature}} written during the past 20 years dealing with the potential psychological problems the ostomate might encounter as a result of the surgery. Research reflected a paucity of articles written on this aspect of the ileostomy surgery and virtually no articles based upon a substantial empirical study of ostomates themselves. Some have assumed, based upon the dramatic body altering nature of the surgery, that the ostomate may have some very serious psychological adjustment problems. However, the thesis, based upon the findings resulting from the information provided by the 63 ileostomates, clearly indicates that the ileostomates cope surprisingly well with life after surgery, including their <b>occupational,</b> <b>family</b> and social lives. In fact, it appears that post surgically, the once chronic sufferer of ulcerative colitis is happier and better adjusted. As evidenced by the survey, there were very few life style changes, and the small changes that did occur were positive in nature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of North American adult females {{do not meet}} current physical activity recommendations (150  min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) per week accrued in ≥ 10  min bouts) ultimately placing themselves at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Working-age females face particular challenges in meeting physical activity recommendations as they have multiple demands, including <b>occupational,</b> <b>family</b> and social demands. To develop effective interventions to increase MVPA among working-age females, {{it is necessary to}} identify and understand the strongest modifiable determinants influencing these behaviours. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to examine the available evidence to identify intrapersonal, social and environmental determinants of MVPA among working-age females. Methods/Design Six electronic databases will be searched to identify all prospective cohort studies that report on intrapersonal, social and/or environmental determinants of MVPA in working-age females. Grey literature sources including theses, published conference abstracts and websites from relevant organizations will also be included. Articles that report on intrapersonal (e. g. health status, self-efficacy, socio-economic status (SES), stress, depression), social environmental (e. g. crime, safety, area SES, social support, climate and capital, policies), and environmental (e. g. weather, workplace, home, neighbourhood, recreation environment, active transportation) determinants of MVPA in a working-age (mean age 18 – 65 years) female population will be included. Risk of bias will be assessed within and across all included studies using the Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Harvest plots will be used to synthesize results across all determinants, and meta-analyses will be conducted where possible among studies with sufficient homogeneity. Discussion This review will provide a comprehensive examination of evidence in this field and will serve to highlight gaps for future research on the determinants of MVPA in working-age females and ultimately inform intervention design.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid pace}} {{of modern life}} {{requires}} working-age women to juggle <b>occupational,</b> <b>family</b> and social demands. This modern lifestyle {{has been shown to}} have a detrimental effect on health, often associated with increased smoking and alcohol consumption, depression and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Despite the proven benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA), few are meeting the current physical activity (PA) recommendations of 150 min of MVPA/week. It is important that appropriate and effective behavioural interventions targeting PA are developed and identified to improve the MVPA levels of working-age women. As these women spend a substantial proportion of their waking hours at work, workplaces may be an opportune, efficient and relatively controlled setting to implement programmes and strategies to target PA in an effort to improve MVPA levels and impact cardiometabolic health. The purposes of this systematic review are to compare the effectiveness of individual-level workplace interventions for increasing MVPA levels in working-age women in high-income/developed countries and examine the effectiveness of these interventions for improving the known beneficial health sequelae of MVPA. Methods/Design Eight electronic databases will be searched to identify all prospective cohort and experimental studies that examine the impact of individual-level workplace interventions for increasing MVPA levels among working-age (mean age 18 – 65 years) women from high-income/developed countries.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid pace}} {{of modern life}} {{requires}} working-age women to juggle <b>occupational,</b> <b>family,</b> and social demands. Despite {{the large numbers of}} working-age women in developed countries and the proven benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity (MVPA) in chronic disease prevention, few women meet current physical activity (PA) recommendations of 150 min of MVPA per week. It is important that appropriate and effective behavioral interventions targeting PA are identified and developed to improve the MVPA levels of working-age women. As women worldwide embrace modern technologies, e-health innovations may provide opportune and convenient methods of implementing programs and strategies to target PA in an effort to improve MVPA levels and cardiometabolic health. Previous reviews on this topic have been limited; none have focused on working-age women from developed countries who exhibit inappropriately low PA levels. It remains unknown as to which e-health interventions are most effective at increasing MVPA levels in this population. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the effectiveness of e-health interventions in raising MVPA levels among working-age women in developed countries and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions in improving the health of women. Methods Eight electronic databases will be searched to identify all prospective cohort and experimental studies examining the impact of e-health interventions for increasing MVPA levels among working-age women (mean age 18 – 65 years) in developed countries.
