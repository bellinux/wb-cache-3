40|$|Reverse cycle {{defrosting}} is {{the most}} widely used standard defrosting method for air source heat pump (ASHP) units. It was suggested in previous experimental studies that during reverse cycle defrosting, downwards flowing of the melted frost due to gravity over a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit has negative effects on defrosting performance. Therefore, an experimental study on draining away locally the melted frost for an experimental ASHP unit having three refrigerant circuits using water <b>collecting</b> <b>trays</b> was carried out and the study results were separately reported. To enable further quantitative analysis on the effects of local draining away the melted frost on reverse cycle defrosting performance of the ASHP unit, a modeling study on the defrosting process, at the two experimental settings of with and without the use of water <b>collecting</b> <b>trays</b> between circuits was carried out and is reported in this paper. Two semi-empirical mathematical models, corresponding to the two settings, were developed. In this paper, firstly the detailed development of the two semi-empirical models is presented. This is followed by reporting the validations of the two models using the experimental data previously reported. Finally, detailed discussions on the potential uses of the two models developed and the limitations of the modeling work reported are included. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

In this paper, the stress has been laid on {{the safety of the}} working personnel by implementing the technique of automation using automated devices and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). In Oil refineries, we have analyzed the specific zone of an oil collection station and found the necessity of implementing a safer working environment for the working personnel. An <b>oil</b> <b>collecting</b> station is an area in an oil refinery where oil in various forms after refining is stored in large oil tanks. It is from here that the stocks of oil are dispatched to various locations. The <b>oil</b> <b>collecting</b> stations contains large cylindrical tanks which are used to store oil. Oil in various form are sent from the digging zone after refining to the <b>oil</b> <b>collecting</b> station through long pipelines. Taking into account these aspects, safety system have been designed and developed in order to secure that area. In any industry the safety of the working personnel is of first priority. The productivity and efficiency of any organization depends on the efficiency of the working personnel. Hence {{it is very important to}} provide a better working environment for the working personnel.

40|$|A {{previous}} related {{study has}} indicated that for an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit having a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil, during reverse cycle defrosting, downwards flowing of melted frost over the outdoor coil surface could affect the defrosting performance, without however giving a detailed quantitative analysis. Therefore an experimental study has been carried out and the study results are reported in this paper. Firstly, a detailed description of a specially built experimental ASHP unit having a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil is presented. This is followed by reporting the experimental results. Finally, a detailed quantitative analysis is presented. The experimental results and the corresponding analysis demonstrated that allowing downwards flowing of the melted frost over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil would result in a longer defrosting duration and more energy consumption. The study results also suggested that the use of water <b>collecting</b> <b>trays</b> can help mitigate these negative impacts on defrosting performance.
