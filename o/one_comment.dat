His omission was highly publicized by Swedish media as he was in the midst of a career season with the Canucks (he went on to record the second-highest goals total among Swedish NHLers that season in 2009–10, with 30).

The magazine's later review of the remake was also fairly positive, finding the atmosphere somber and the battles entertaining, stating that the reviewers appreciated being able to play both parts of Persona 2 on PSP. IGN's David Smith, while noting the game's slower pace than other contemporary RPGs, he generally enjoyed the plot's mature themes and the Rumor and Persona systems. Summing up, he said: [...] "Its unique visual style, its unusual characters, and its absorbing gameplay systems make it a game to kill plenty of hours with this winter." ...|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just <b>one</b> <b>comment</b> on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E

500|$|When {{he retired}} from the NHL, Vanbiesbrouck took over as the head coach and {{director}} of hockey operations for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In February 2003, the team had a record of 18-24-4-3. A month later on March 7, the Greyhounds lost 6–1 to the Guelph Storm. After the game Vanbiesbrouck used a racial slur in expressing his anger with Trevor Daley (now with the Detroit Red Wings), a black player and Greyhounds' team captain, to two of Daley's white teammates. Daley was told of the remarks by his teammates and was advised to leave the team by his agent Bobby Orr. Daley returned home to Toronto and informed the commissioner of the OHL about the remarks. The day after Daley left the team, Vanbiesbrouck resigned his positions as coach and general manager, and sold his ownership stake in the team. In his apology Vanbiesbrouck stated [...] "I used the 'N' word instead of calling him Trevor, I used it just not thinking. It's a mistake and consequences have to be paid by me, I've embarrassed everybody and my family by this <b>one</b> <b>comment.</b> It's not what they represent and it's not what the Sault Greyhounds organization represents." [...] He added [...] "I told Trev this is an old wound with me, I grew up with it. I'm as sorry as anybody that it's stuck with me." [...] Daley returned to the team three days after leaving, but Vanbiesbrouck never returned to a coaching position.|$|E
500|$|Jardine's first {{experience}} against Australia {{came when he}} scored an unbeaten 96 to secure a draw against the 1921 Australian touring side for Oxford University. The tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, but had tried {{to help him with}} some easy bowling. There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine's antipathy towards Australians, although Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas denies this. Jardine's attitude towards Australia hardened after he toured the country in 1928–29. When he scored three consecutive hundreds in the early games, he was frequently jeered by the crowd for slow play; the Australian spectators took an increasing dislike to him, mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear—a Harlequin cap that was given to successful Oxford cricketers. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators; his general demeanour drew <b>one</b> <b>comment</b> of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] By this stage Jardine had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when teammate Patsy Hendren remarked that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". During the tour, Jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding, particularly when chasing the ball. On one occasion, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E
500|$|Jardine was {{the centre}} of {{attention}} {{at the start of}} the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing <b>one</b> <b>comment</b> of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{area has}} also been {{utilized}} during times when security concerns {{make it difficult to}} allow the use of the outdoor prayer plaza, such as the March 19, 2009 visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the Wall and Temple Mount. Despite the fact that the Pope's visit coincided with the Jewish festival of Lag B'Omer, the decision had been made to close the Wall and not allow services, but {{at the request of the}} Wall's rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz, the government allowed worship to be conducted in the area within the Arch. The original decision to close the entire prayer area to Jewish worship had begun to elicit negative reaction as soon as the decision was announced, between one and two months before the visit. Rabbi Rabinowitz, protesting the decision, was quoted as saying that [...] "It's inconceivable that the pope's visit would hurt worshippers at the Western Wall, some of whom have been praying there daily."
