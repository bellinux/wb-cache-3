5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> with transcripts of these, which {{he had not been}} given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E

Other members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone who took <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> included Miner Searle Bates and John Magee. George A.

25|$|The court called Hitler {{to appear}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> on 8 May 1931. Litten {{set out to}} show that the SA Sturm 33 ("Storm 33") was a rollkommando (a small, mobile {{paramilitary}} unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership. This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts {{to be seen as a}} serious politician and statesman.|$|E

25|$|Graciela Reyes, {{played by}} Tara Correa-McMullen: She is {{a gang member}} Amy counsels. As time passes, she makes progress, though she is arrested one day for murder, as {{she was in the}} car with her cousin when she was {{involved}} in a drive-by shooting. Graciela is tried and found guilty as an adult because of a cousin's lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> and thus being sent to adult prison. The cousin later recants, but Graciela is murdered in a gang retaliation before Amy can get her out of prison.|$|E
25|$|Eric Black, {{played by}} Blake Bashoff: He is a gay {{teenager}} {{who had been}} so badly abused that he was blind for two years. When all else fails, Maxine reluctantly takes him into her home, where he rapidly bonds with the family; afterwards, Sean becomes his foster father. Eventually, Eric protectively confronts and kills a stalker after Amy and Lauren. He is tried and found not guilty, but does so by lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> Maxine is disappointed in him, so he decides to move to Canada with his boyfriend, Mark.|$|E
25|$|When <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> Erickson gave a {{detailed}} description of Ferguson strangling Heitholt, despite apparently not remembering any details following the murders and during the interrogation. The defense countered that all of the evidence found at the crime scene pointed elsewhere. None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson was driving the night of the murder. Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E

50|$|The trial resumes and Felix Gaeta takes <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> He perjures {{himself by}} saying Baltar willingly signed the death {{order to have}} Roslin, Zarek, and others executed. Rather than {{attempting}} to disprove this during cross-examination, however, Lampkin acts on Lee Adama's suggestion and moves for a mistrial, based on prejudicial statements Admiral Adama had made to Lee concerning Baltar's guilt and the trial's outcome. Lee then takes <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> but refuses to testify against his father, instead returning to Lampkin's original line of argument that Baltar, for all his failings, could not be faulted for <b>the</b> tragedy <b>on</b> New Caprica.|$|R
25|$|During the hearings, a {{photograph}} of Schine was introduced, and Joseph Welch accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> Cohn and Schine both insisted that the picture entered into evidence (Schine and Stevens alone) was requested by Stevens {{and that no one}} was edited out of the photograph. Welch then produced a wider shot of Stevens and Schine with McGuire AFB wing commander Colonel Jack Bradley standing to Schine's right. A fourth person also edited out of the picture (his sleeve was visible to Bradley's right in the Welch photograph) was identified as McCarthy aide Frank Carr.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} then reinstated {{charges in}} February 1940 against Gold, the NTWIU and 28 other labor leaders based on allegations not pursued in 1933. Charges against six labor leaders were dropped on March 20, 1940, and four others but Gold and 17 others were tried. Despite one witness recanting {{most of his}} accusatory testimony <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> Gold and IFWU Vice President Irving Potash were convicted of these additional antitrust charges. As the union raised a $100,000 defense fund for Gold and Potash, the government brought a fresh set of charges against Gold on May 17, 1940, accusing him of jury tampering during his first trial. As the jury deliberated Gold's fate, a group of employers sued Gold and the NTWIU for $3 million in damages under the Clayton Antitrust Act, and accusations of witness tampering were levied against Gold.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{agreed to}} provide boats and other {{provisions}} for the expedition. However, on November 10, he learned from a military captain that Burr's plans apparently included seizure of New Orleans, then part of the Louisiana Territory of the United States, and incorporating it, along with lands won from the Spanish, into a new empire. He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of Brigadier General James Wilkinson, whom he deeply disliked, in the plan. Jackson acted cautiously at first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President Thomas Jefferson, vaguely warning them about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were sent home. Jackson traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team decided against placing him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed James Monroe for President in 1808 against James Madison. The latter {{was part of the}} Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E

50|$|During {{the course}} of the trial, both Braithwaite and Alleyne took <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> Braithwaite claimed that Kinsella had thrown a punch at him, {{although}} there was no supporting evidence of this. After this, Braithwaite claimed he saw Alleyne carry out the murder. Braithwaite also claimed that a friend of Alleyne had punched him in the cells of the Old Bailey whilst he was handcuffed to a wall. Alleyne claimed that he had been contacted by Braithwaite and asked to back him following the dispute at Shillibeers, although no phone records identified a call between Braithwaite and Alleyne prior to the attack. Kika exercised his right to silence and did not take <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|R

25|$|If {{the law is}} made as it {{now stands}} respectable {{families}} in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be {{denied the right to}} intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture ofâ€¦ colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2016, {{prosecutors}} {{announced that}} they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would, instead, seek to have him deported.

Babs Proller, the woman who made the recording, turned it over to the police. [...] The U.S. Attorney's Office only stated that based on new information that had come to light during the previous week, there was no longer enough evidence to go forward with the retrial.|$|E

500|$|Starting on September 23 and {{continuing}} {{for over three}} weeks, each of the accused men {{was brought to the}} witness stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men's responses was that all of them were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by [...] "ringleaders" [...] persuading them not to workeach had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some men said that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers [...] "by the balls". <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> Small himself denied saying any such thing, though he would admit to it decades later in interviews.|$|E
