50|$|The Thermo Electric <b>Ore</b> <b>Reduction</b> Corporation Mill is {{significant}} in Queensland's history {{as an example}} of overseas (British) capital funding a state-of-the-art ore processing works, which was short-lived (18 months) due to foreign market influences and an inability to diversify.|$|E

The last analysis of specimens selected to represent the bulk had not been encouraging, but this test was unsatisfactory because the ore was variable.|$|R
40|$|Industrial pyrometallurgical {{processes}} in ferrous metallurgy {{are based on}} carbothermal reduction of metal oxides. Carbothermal reduction of stable oxides requires high temperatures. Low-temperature reduction can be implemented by using methane-containing gas with high carbon activity, or by carbothermal reduction under reduced CO partial pressure. Under standard conditions, methane is thermodynamically unstable above 550 °C and decomposes to solid carbon and hydrogen. At appropriate CH 4 /H 2 ratio and temperature, carbon activity in the methane-containing gas phase can be well above unity relative to graphite, which provides favorable thermodynamic conditions for reduction. To maintain these conditions, the rate of reduction/carburisation should be higher than the rate of solid carbon deposition. The paper discusses reduction of pure manganese and chromium oxides at relatively low temperatures, and constraints in reduction of manganese and chromium <b>ores.</b> <b>Reduction</b> of metal oxides by carbon in hydrogen as an alternative use of natural gas is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Production {{of direct}} reduced iron (DRI) was {{performed}} by a novel and environmentally friendly approach through a systematic experimental process development and process integration study on bio-oil reforming and iron <b>ores</b> <b>reduction.</b> The Ni-Cu-Zn-Al₂O₃ catalyst is one of most suitable candidates for bio-oil reforming because this non-noble metal catalyst can efficiently reform the bio-oil to H₂ and CO₂ at a lower operating temperature (450 - 500 °C) with a longer lifetime. The catalytic activities of the Ni-Cu-Zn-Al₂O₃ catalyst for different processes, including the reforming of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil, the water-gas shift reaction and the decomposition of organic compounds, have been investigated. A hydrogen yield of 87. 4 % with a carbon conversion of 91. 8 % was obtained at T = 500 °C and S/C = 6. 1. The hydrogen content reached about 94. 6 vol% after simple purification by removing CO₂. Furthermore, direct reduction of iron oxides at different reduction temperatures was investigated using on-line rich-hydrogen reducing gases. The metallization for production of DRI from three ore powders (limonite, hematite and magnetite) and hematite pellets ranges from 93 to 97 % at 850 °C for 1 h reduction. The reduction process from the oxidized iron to metallic iron and the intermediate phases were investigated via chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence analyses. The green DRI process with high reduction efficiency and real environmental benefits would, potentially, be a useful route to produce DRI from bio-oil or biomass. 12 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Mormon Island {{was used}} to {{assemble}} and launch the Southwestern Mining Company's schooner Sou'Wester, in 1879. Because the steamers could not reach the Virgin River during the low water months, and barges had been sailed up the river from Hardyville from the 1860s in the low water season, the mining company, had the Sou'Wester built in San Francisco, knocked down and shipped by rail to Yuma, Arizona, then shipped up river on the steamboat Gila to Hardyville where carpenters were waiting to reassemble it. The schooner was subsequently used to sail salt from the mines in the Virgin River valley down river from Rioville through the Boulder and Black Canyons {{to be used in}} the Southwestern Mining Company's silver <b>ore</b> <b>reduction</b> furnaces at Eldorado Canyon. It occasionally sailed down river as far as Hardyville to pick up freight. [...] It was wrecked in the Short and Dirty Rapids in the upper river in 1882.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{starts with}} the mineral structure, {{reducing}} properties of chromium ore and the {{physical and chemical properties}} of chromium oxide and discusses the requirements of the chemical composition of chromite and confirms the selection principle of chromium ore and reducing agent of chromium <b>ore</b> smelting <b>reduction.</b> The chemical compositions of the available chromite request the relatively high contents of chromium and iron, the lower contents of Al 2 O 3, MgO and P in gangue and the lower Cr/Fe ratio in keeping with the case of high chromium. Chromoium ore in South Africa is considered to be suitable for smelting stainless steel crude melts in a smelting reduction converter. From the reducing power and economy angle, carbon as a reducing agent is more suited to reducing chromium ore...|$|R

40|$|AbstractKinetics of Brazilian iron <b>ore</b> fines <b>reduction</b> was {{investigated}} in a micro fluidized bed, a newly developed kinetics analyzer for gas-solid reactions, where the effects of external and internal diffusion were significantly reduced by modifying the operation conditions. The reducing gas {{was a mixture of}} CO and N 2 and the temperature ranged from 973 K to 1123 K. The experimental data was analyzed with respect to the reduction mechanism of iron oxides, and the feasibility of the segment treatment on the experimental data was discussed. The kinetics parameters were determined by the iso-reduction degree method as well as models matching method, and compared with available data in the literature. Moreover, a reduction model for iron ore fines was hence established in terms of piecewise differential rate function, and the reduction stage FexO→Fe is considered as the most likely limit step during the <b>reduction</b> of iron <b>ore</b> fines...|$|R

40|$|Effect of sulphur on {{iron carbide}} process was {{investigated}} by examining iron <b>ore</b> <b>reduction,</b> iron cementation and cementite decomposition under gas atmosphere {{with and without}} sulphur. Sulphur added to H 2 -Ar gas {{in the form of}} H 2 S slightly decreased the rate of iron <b>ore</b> <b>reduction</b> at 750 oC, but had a negligible effectat 850 oC. Sulphur strongly retarded iron cementation. At 850 oC, cementite was formed in 10 min by sulphur-free gas, 100 min when gas contained 50 ppm H 2 S, and 180 min when H 2 S was in the amount of 100 ppm. The rate of cementite formation increased with increasing temperature from 750 oC to 925 oC. Sulphur also strongly retarded free carbon deposition and stabilised cementite. However sulphur had no significant effect on the rate of cementite decomposition when it was introduced to the gas atmosphere after the completion of the cementation process...|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of gold by ore leaching {{is influenced by}} the size of the particles and the chemical environment. The effect of particle size on the dissolution of gold is usually studied using mono-size particles as the gold in solution comes from the ore of a unique leached particle size. This paper proposes a method to estimate the gold dissolution as a function of particle size using a bulk ore sample, i. e., with the dissolved gold coming from the various sizes of particles carried by the ore. The results are consistent with the fact that gold dissolution increases with the decreasing particle size but results also indicate that gold dissolution of the ore within a size interval is not significantly affected by the grinding time used for the <b>ore</b> size <b>reduction.</b> Results also show a good dissolution of the gold contained in the fine-size fractions without oxidation and lead nitrate pre-treatment for an ore that is known to require such pre-treatment...|$|R
5000|$|The Corex Process is a {{smelting}} reduction process created by Siemens VAI {{as a more}} environmentally friendly alternative to the blast furnace. Presently, the majority of steel production is through the blast furnace which has to rely on ever decreasing amounts of coking coal. That is coal which has been cooked in order to remove impurities {{so that it is}} superior to coal. [...] In addition, the Blast furnace requires a sinter plant too in order to prepare the iron <b>ore</b> for <b>reduction.</b> [...] Unlike the Blast Furnace, {{smelting reduction}} processes are typical smaller and use coal and oxygen directly to reduce iron ore into a usable product. Smelting reduction processes come in two basic varieties, two-stage or single-stage. In a single-stage system the iron ore is both reduced and melted in the same container. Meanwhile, in a two-stage process, like Corex, the ore is reduced in one shaft and melted and purified in another. Plants using the Corex process have been put use in areas such as South Africa, India, and China.|$|R
