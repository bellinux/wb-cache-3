40|$|Formation of protoplanets and {{binary stars}} in a protostellar disk modifies the {{structure}} of the disk. Through tidal interactions, energy and angular momentum are transferred between the disk and protostellar or protoplanetary companion. We summarize recent progress in theoretical investigations of the disk-companion tidal interaction. We show that low-mass protoplanets excite density waves at their Lindblad resonances and that these waves are likely to be dissipated locally. When a protoplanet acquires sufficient mass, its tidal torque induces the formation of a gap in the vicinity of its <b>orbit.</b> <b>Gap</b> formation leads to the termination of protoplanetary growth by accretion. For proto-Jupiter to attain its present mass, we require that (1) the primordial solar nebula is heated by viscous dissipation; (2) the viscous evolution time scale of the nebula is comparable to the age of typical T Tauri stars with circumstellar disks; and (3) the mass distribution in the nebula is comparable to that estimated from a minimum-mass nebula model...|$|E

Here we demonstrate that gaps can be opened in dynamically cold debris disks at the mean-motion resonances of an <b>orbiting</b> planet. The <b>gaps</b> are opened away from the orbit of the planet itself, revealing that not all disk gaps need contain a planetary body. These gaps are large and deep enough to be detectable in resolved disk images {{for a wide range of}} reasonable disk-planet parameters, though we are not aware of any such gaps detected to date. The gap shape and size are diagnostic of the planet location, eccentricity and mass, and allow one to infer the existence of unseen planets, as well as many important parameters of both seen and unseen planets in these systems. We present expressions to allow the planetary mass to be calculated from observed gap width and location. Comment: minor revisions to reflect accepted ApJ versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects are}} studied of gas drag and gravitational perturbations by a proto-Jupiter on the orbital {{evolution of a}} swarm of planetesimals in the primordial asteroid belt in the 2 : 1 mean motion resonance region. The gas drag in the primordial nebula causes planetesimals to spiral towards the Sun and, therefore, to cross mean motion resonances with proto-Jupiter. The dynamics of planetesimals are numerically investigated while passing through an inner resonance in a planar model. It is found that eccentricities are drastically increased and the maximum value reached by each planetesimal depends only on the resonance argument ψ at the resonance entry. The higher average eccentricity of the swarm within the resonance borders induces a faster spiralling rate of planetesimals and a consequent decrease of their number density, in particular at the 2 : 1, the most relevant resonance in the asteroid belt. This phenomenon causes {{the formation of a}} gap in the swarm at the resonance location. By integrating a large number of planetesimal <b>orbits,</b> the <b>gap</b> formation process is analysed; it is found that the planetesimal number density near the resonance centre is reduced to 10 - 40 % of its average value, depending on the free eccentricity assumed for the proto-Jupiter. Relative velocities between planetesimals are increased by a factor of four by resonant perturbations, favouring fragmentation at impacts; higher impact velocities and the reduced planetesimal density slow down the planetesimal accretion process and inhibit the formation of big bodies in the resonance region...|$|R

We find that the hydrodynamic evolution of individual scattering systems is complex, and can involve phases in which massive planets <b>orbit</b> within eccentric <b>gaps,</b> or accrete directly from the disc without a gap.

In this work we study the conditions and the dynamics of such resonant trapping.

For two planet systems we associate the evolution of migration with the existence of families of periodic orbits in the phase space of the three-body problem. The family of circular periodic <b>orbits</b> exhibits a <b>gap</b> at the 2 : 1 resonance and an instability and bifurcation at the 3 : 1 resonance.

At a planet eccentricity above the planet's Hill radius divided by its semi-major axis, we find that the disk morphology differs from that exhibited by a disk containing a planet in a circular <b>orbit.</b> An eccentric <b>gap</b> is created with eccentricity that can exceed the planet's eccentricity and precesses with respect to the planet's orbit. We find that a more massive planet is required to open a gap when the planet is on an eccentric orbit. We attribute this behavior to spiral density waves excited at corotation resonances that increase the disk's eccentricity and exert a torque opposite in sign to that exerted by the Lindblad resonances. The reduced torque makes it more difficult for waves driven by the planet to overcome viscous inflow in the disk.

Here, we present new J-band imaging polarimetry of LkCa 15 with SPHERE IRDIS, yielding the most accurate and detailed scattered-light images of the disk to date down to the planet-hosting inner regions. We find what appear to be persistent asymmetric structures in the scattering material at the location of the planet candidates, which could be responsible at least for parts of the signals measured with sparse-aperture masking. These images further allow us to trace the gap edge in scattered light at all position angles and search the inner and outer disks for morphological substructure. The outer disk appears smooth with slight azimuthal variations in polarized surface brightness, which may be due to shadowing from the inner disk or a two-peaked polarized phase function.

40|$|ORBITAL defects {{are rare}} {{congenital}} abnormalities and the protrusion of intracranial contents into the orbit {{is a rare}} cause of congenital exophthalmos, less than 100 cases having been recorded. Duke-Elder (1952) states "An orbital cephalocoele, wherein {{a portion of the}} contents of the skull protrudes into the orbit, is not common; some eighty cases are on record since Brechet's original publication in 1831 ". The development of the orbit is complicated and is available in text-books of anatomy and embryology. It may be con-cluded that it is formed from the mesoderm surrounding the eyeball by con-densation into bone (Spondli, 1846; von K 6 lliker, 1861; Schultze, 1896), and that both membrane and cartilage bone share in its formation. The multi-plicity of the embryonic parts sharing {{in the formation of the}} bony <b>orbit</b> allows <b>gaps</b> to occur through which cranio-orbital communication or herniation may take place. Herniations occur not only through these defective gaps but also through the natural openings, e. g. the optic foramen or the sphenoid fissure. The defects are of two types, anterior and posterior. The anterior type is the commonest and it is located between the frontal bone, lacrimal bone, cribriform bone and the nasal process of the maxilla. The cephalocoele protrudes forwards " from the inner canthus onto the face or laterally displaces the eye " outwards. Sometimes it is visible at the base of the nose. " It may be bilateral and symmetrical (de Britto, 1904; Rohmer, 1905 a,b; Peters, 1917) ". The sac is usually connected with the cranial cavity by a pedicle which insinuates itself between one or other of the cranial sutures, thus producing a defect in the bone although occasionally "no communication with the cranial cavity is detected (di Marzio, 1924) ". This last form may be called a sequestrated meningocoele. The posterior type is less common. Strandberg (1949), who reviewed the literature from 1841 to 1948, reported 31 cases of this type and added one of his own, and Tayebi and Silverman (1956) reported two cases. The cranial contents may protrude through a natural opening, such as the optic foramen, the superior orbital fissure, or the posterior ethmoid foramen, or through a * Received for publication May 4, 1959...|$|R

The planet candidates, on the other hand, reside at orbital radii around 15 au, where disk observations have been unreliable until recently. Here we present new J-band imaging polarimetry of LkCa 15 with SPHERE IRDIS, yielding the most accurate and detailed scattered-light images of the disk to date down to the planet-hosting inner regions. We find what appear to be persistent asymmetric structures in the scattering material at the location of the planet candidates, which could be responsible at least for parts of the signals measured with sparse-aperture masking. These images further allow us to trace the gap edge in scattered light at all position angles and search the inner and outer disks for morphological substructure. The outer disk appears smooth with slight azimuthal variations in polarized surface brightness, which may be due to shadowing from the inner disk or a two-peaked polarized phase function. We find that the near-side gap edge revealed by polarimetry matches the sharp crescent seen in previous ADI imaging very well. Finally, the ratio of polarized disk to stellar flux is more than six times larger in J-band than in the RI bands. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table; accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
