5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of {{this fact}} appears in the bit-reversed {{ordering}} of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} embarrassment to the {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of the {{reassessment}} of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down {{the opportunity to}} kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, a dictator would be appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and <b>one</b> <b>consequence</b> of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the two states were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between the two states in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the two states.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the throne, Ranavalona annulled the Anglo-Merina treaty that had been {{concluded}} between Radama and British envoys, and refused to continue receiving annual payments from Britain in exchange for adherence to the stipulations of the treaty. The most significant of these conditions was the kingdom's non-participation in the international slave trade, which had historically been {{a major source of}} revenue for the kingdoms of Imerina, Betsimisaraka, Sakalava and others across the island. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> of the termination of the Anglo-Merina friendship treaty was an end to the delivery of British weaponry, which rendered the queen vulnerable to designs against her from foreign powers and pockets of local resistance alike. This vulnerability was underscored in 1829 when a fleet of six French ships launched an unprovoked attack against the fort of Foulpointe and the nearby town of Ivondro on the eastern coast of Madagascar. The queen's army successfully repelled the French at the next port, forcing the ships to Île Sainte-Marie, where they engaged a diplomatic envoy sent from Antananarivo by Ranavalona. The protracted negotiations ensured the French suffered from the malaria prevalent in coastal areas, until the increasing casualties forced the ships' withdrawal from Ranavalona's territory.|$|E

40|$|This study {{serves to}} examine the effects Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and {{personality}} have on alcohol-related consequences in collegiate students. To investigate these relationships, a survey was distributed to Butler University students via their daily email listserv, and 101 students’ responses were recorded. Using multiple regression analyses, no relationship was found between an individual’s degree of experienced FoMO and alcohol related consequences; however, neuroticism was found to be strongly correlated with FoMO. Additionally, extroversion inversely predicted more alcohol-related consequences, and Greek affiliation was found to be a significant predictor of <b>one’s</b> <b>consequences</b> as well...|$|R

25|$|Gluons {{also share}} this {{property}} of being confined within hadrons. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> is that gluons {{are not directly}} involved in the nuclear forces between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called mesons.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Constantine I {{promoted}} the Christianization of Roman society, giving it precedence over pagan cults. <b>One</b> <b>consequence</b> was that Hadrian's Temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount was demolished {{immediately following the}} First Council of Nicea in 325 CE on orders of Constantine.|$|E
