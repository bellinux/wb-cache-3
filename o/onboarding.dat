Before its release, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon wrote that he thought about Videoball daily after last playing two weeks prior due to its [...] "addictive sort of fun" [...] and his excitement for local multiplayer on PC following Hokra and TowerFall. He felt that the game's tagline of being appropriate for both a child's birthday party and prison was correct albeit silly. Fenlon praised the game's minimalist visuals, [...] "peppy music, and chirpy sound effects". He compared the player's controls to that of Asteroids and contrasted its simplicity with the 100-hour <b>onboarding</b> process for League of Legends, having learned Videoball after [...] "a couple minutes". Polygon Tracey Lien compared the game's feel to basketball, football, and hockey. Citing the strong role of strategy in playing the game, she compared the array of projectiles fired to military strategy or a football play.|$|E

Most of test cases are manually generated and can‟t be reused and leads to repeated works when the specification is changed. We introduced scenario-based method to improve the efficiency and quality of <b>onboard</b> equipment testing. The scenario-based hierarchy model of <b>onboard</b> subsystem was established according to the specification, and all definition coverage criteria were proposed with the all definition coverage observer. Then, an automatic tool chain was used to establish the <b>onboard</b> automata model and generate test cases for every scenario. Finally, a selection algorithm was given to choose a complete test sequence from the test cases, which was proven comprehensive to cover all running modes and efficient for <b>onboard</b> equipment testing.
