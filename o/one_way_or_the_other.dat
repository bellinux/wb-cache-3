But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery.

During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E

5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim. About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put that issues on agenda. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E

25|$|A {{balanced}} armature is a {{sound transducer}} design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move {{in the field of}} the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the armature <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> causing it to rotate slightly <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.|$|E

25|$|In 728, Leo sent to Italy a new exarch, Eutychius, {{to try to}} {{retrieve}} the situation. Eutychius sent an emissary to Rome, with instructions to kill Gregory and the chief nobility in the city, but the plot was uncovered and foiled. Next, he attempted to turn the Lombard king and dukes against the pope, but they retained their ambivalent stance, not committing <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> That same year Gregory wrote to Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople, giving the patriarch his support, and when Germanus abdicated, Gregory refused to acknowledge the new patriarch, Anastasius, nor the iconoclast rulings of a council summoned by Leo.|$|E
25|$|Gregory {{was also}} asked to {{arbitrate}} during his journey to Francia in 833 the case against Aldric of Le Mans, who was being forced out of his see by partisans of Lothair. On July 8 833, Gregory wrote to the bishops of “Gaul, Europe and Germany” declaring that Aldric {{had every right to}} appeal to the pope, and that until the pope had issued a judgement <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> no-one could pass a sentence against him. Further, that this mandate had to be obeyed in order to remain in communion with the Roman church.

25|$|However, {{it is also}} possible, {{by holding}} the seam at an angle and rolling the fingers {{over the surface of}} the ball, to produce a {{deliberate}} off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch - a tactic very effectively used by Mustafizur Rahman.|$|E
