25|$|Libertine Grimm {{is another}} gothic {{character}} who {{is actually an}} amalgam of many different women. She is sexy, erudite and possessed of an extraordinary wit, but this is counterbalanced by an unhealthy appetite for self-destruction and flights of morbid fancy, brought on by dark secrets, terribly chic drugs and wild, sexual abandonment. She is a gluttonous Miss Muffet; the fairy-tale girl who ate the Big Bad Wolf; and the beauty who slept with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coming talent. Libertina Grimm is every goth girl's coven mistress.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} team composing Vietnamese natives {{began to be}} assembled, drawing mainly from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Sport. Several members of the squad had previous experience in baseball (also a relatively new sport {{in this part of}} the world) and two had previously played on the Vietnam national baseball team. The team began playing in the VCA league to gain experience, which had previously been expat-only. Their coach was Australian expat Mick Blinkhoff. By early 2017, in preparation for the SEA Games in August, the national squad members were training five days a week and got a government stipend of VND5 million per week (INR14,148; USD219.5; GBP171.35). The VCA already has <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2021 Southeast Asian Games, hosted in Hanoi.|$|E

He argued that our unconscious knowledge could never be captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it was doomed to failure, an exercise in [...] "tree climbing with <b>one's</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon." ...|$|R

500|$|Rosas {{failed to}} realize that discontent was {{steadily}} growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at {{his right hand and}} became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: [...] "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; he goes in constant fear and always has <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night".|$|E

It also appears that the players {{will not be able}} to hold a contract from their provinces but will be allowed to play on a game by game basis.|$|E
5000|$|According to The New York TimesThe gobbledegookish {{title of}} Warner's Mara Maru {{is not the}} only obscure and unexciting thing about this stale {{adventure}} film. Its wholly improbable build-up of a criss-cross of rivalries... is bleakly confused and grossly tiresome, and when the action does finally get around to the business of diving for the treasure it is hackneyed and cheaply emotionalized. Even Errol Flynn and Ruth Roman as the working stars in its cast give the impression of being bored and indifferent toward it all.The Los Angeles Times said that [...] "while its scenes of physical action are scarcely original... they keep <b>one's</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen with a fair amount of absorption. What ails the overall production is that its performers talk too darn much." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Oxford Canal was {{originally}} {{built as a}} contour canal, meaning that it twisted around hills to minimise vertical deviations from a level contour. However, with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> developing railway network, in the 1820s the northern section of the canal between Braunston and Hawkesbury Junction was straightened out to reduce navigation time. This work reduced the distance by 14miles 6furlongs (23.7km). The section south of Napton was never straightened. The straightening challenged the capacity of three locks at Hillmorton, the first on the canal after the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction. The solution to the congestion was to duplicate or twin the existing locks at Hillmorton, creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks, which allowed for twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time. The work to double the locks was completed in August 1840. Not only was the capacity to pass the lock doubled, but the time taken was decreased as the locks were narrower. Tests showed that the locks could be operated {{in as little as}} one minute and 20 seconds! ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 saw Keating’s side {{taken on}} Limerick in their opening game. [...] It {{was a game}} that Tipp were {{expected}} to win, however, Limerick put up a good fight and the game ended in a draw. [...] For the replay of the game Keating made the drastic move of dropping legendary goalkeeper Brendan Cummins. [...] The second game saw Keating’s side lead by ten points at one stage, however, {{by the end of}} the seventy minutes both sides were level once again. [...] A period of extra-time failed to separate these two sides were forced to meet for a third time. [...] Once again extra-time had to be played, however, after nearly four hours of hurling Limerick emerged as the winners. [...] After the defeat Keating looked less than impressed when he was forced to do a television interview alongside ecstatic Limerick manager Richie Bennis. [...] The All-Ireland qualifiers saw Keating’s side win all of their games, including a victory over Cork for the first time since 1991. [...] It looked as if Tipp had come out on the easy side of the draw as their opponents, Wexford, were not regarded as being up to much. [...] Because of this Keating may have been guilty of having <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> All-Ireland semi-final. [...] His decision to relegate star forward Eoin Kelly to the substitutes bench baffled many, particularly since Kelly tops the chart as Tipp’s all-time top scorer. [...] The game itself was an exciting one, however, a Damien Fitzhenry penalty sealed the victory for Wexford and dumped Tipp out of the championship. [...] Keating resigned as manager shortly after this defeat.|$|E

30|$|The same content {{would have}} been {{received}} differently if the headline had asserted it: You are living with closed eyes! Most of the target would have recognised it as false and offensive. But the ad was designed as it was, because its being presented {{in the form of}} a presupposition allowed for the same content to be easily accepted by everyone. This is because presupposition effected its being processed in a vague, less scrupulous way, so that its intrinsic falsity and offensiveness was not noticed. The ad cleverly gives evidence (by asserting it) to the idea of opening <b>one’s</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary the presupposed idea that they were previously “closed” passes into the addressee’s knowledge without undergoing a moment of true focusing, i.e. of purposeful attention, which would probably lead to better awareness and rejection. Lesser attention thus prevents critical challenging of the offensive content, but not its becoming part of the state of the world believed by the addressee after reading the advertisement. In this case, the result is that one feels the strong need to change his “blindness” situation (by buying a new television screen).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Speech {{recognition}} {{technology is}} rapidly {{advancing to the}} point here it {{can be usefully applied}} {{in a wide range of}} mtexts. For applications within the SERC Environment Committee's area of interest -civil engineering; construction; building; transport; water resources there are a number of kinds of recording situation in which one needs to keep <b>one's</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation being studied; or in which the recording conditions (eg moving around with instruments) are unfavourable. The limitations of conventional pen and paper recording for these situations are obvious; and the limitations of hand-held data capture devices are also becoming apparent. Speech is therefore an easier medium to use; and a tape recorder a convenient means of recording the observations. For well defined recording tasks; speech recognisers might be a helpful way of transcribing the record. This seminar was convened to enable those who are potentially interested in such an application of information technology to hear of the latest developnents and assessments of the suitability of the technology...|$|R

How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen! When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence. You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix <b>one's</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy." ...|$|R
