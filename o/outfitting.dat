This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her <b>outfitting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{maritime}} fur {{trade was}} dominated by American traders from the 1790s to the 1820s. Between 1788 and 1826, American merchant ships made at least 127 voyages between the United States and China, via the Northwest Coast. The returns were lucrative. During the late 1810s, the return on investment ranged from about 300% to 500%. Even higher profits were common {{in the first decade}} of the 19th century. Returns of 2,200% or higher were common, although when taking into account the cost of buying and <b>outfitting</b> vessels, the 2,200% return would be closer to 525%.|$|E

Accessory sets were retained, numbered 1A to 9A, that converted a set to the next in the series (for example, accessory set 6A would convert a No. 6 set to a No. 7 set). As had been the case from early days, Meccano Ltd would also supply individual Meccano parts to complement existing sets.|$|R

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and <b>outfitting</b> of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E

2500|$|The {{need to buy}} a new <b>outfit</b> {{each year}} has given rise to a market in <b>outfits</b> for the images. Purchase of the <b>outfits</b> {{generally}} begins as early as December and continues until 2 February. <b>Outfits</b> range from the very simple made with inexpensive fabrics to elaborate creations in silk. The most common <b>outfits</b> are made with silk, satin, cotton and brocades decorated with silver or gold. Stationery stores generally sell the most traditional of <b>outfits</b> and the more expensive ones. However, these <b>outfits</b> are most commonly bought in traditional open markets called “tianguis.” [...] Here, more original ones can be found and can include various saints, pre-Hispanic dress, mariachis, soccer players and ethnic dress of various nationalities. Custom orders are also taken. Some priests frown upon the non-traditional <b>outfits</b> and only want white.

5|$|The Banner State was {{the first}} {{steamboat}} to land materials for building the city in early 1854, before the city was formally founded. Until 1879 Captain Joseph La Barge was the principal figure among the Missouri steamboat captains {{in the early years}} of the city. According to J. Sterling Morton, the golden era for steamboating on the Missouri was from 1855 to 1860, just before the advent of the railroads. In 1857, 174 steamboats carrying 13,000 tons of freight tied up at Omaha wharves. When Omaha became the <b>outfitting</b> center for Colorado gold seekers headed for Pikes Peak in 1859, 268 steamboats arrived at Omaha between March and November.|$|E

5|$|He married Ellen Negus in 1901, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. He was a {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party. He ran businesses throughout his career, with little success, and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his <b>outfitting</b> shop was damaged by fire. During the 1910s he ran a public house (despite being a teetotaller) and later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous Stretford cinemas in the 1930s. He also starred in 1926 picture The Ball of Fortune, playing himself as a football trainer; the film received generally positive reviews. In 1928, together with former colleague Charlie Roberts he became a coach for the ambitious but short-lived Manchester Central. Meredith's son-in-law, former City captain Charlie Pringle, was a player. He retained a passion for football, and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel, the Stretford Road Hotel, which he ran from 1930 to 1945. He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The British and Egyptian governments {{would not}} again attempt major {{intervention}} until 1896, whereupon {{the government in}} Britain was impelled to act by several factors. The Egyptian economy had improved since British administrators commandeered the country's finances. Public sentiment towards Mahdist Sudan had been stoked by several embellished accounts of the Mahdists' savagery {{and the desire to}} avenge General Charles Gordon. France, Britain's longtime competitor in the Scramble for Africa, was beginning to encroach upon the Nile river valley, alongside the Belgians. Finally, it was politically advantageous in Europe for Britain to distract the Khalifa from the Italians in Eritrea, who had been made vulnerable by a recent defeat at the hands of Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia. The government chose Herbert Horatio Kitchener to lead the new expedition, <b>outfitting</b> him with around ten-thousand soldiers and Britain's latest technology: Maxim guns, heavy artillery, and a small fleet of gunboats.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and <b>outfitting</b> a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{convalescence}} in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he {{found that he was}} in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery. With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the <b>outfitting</b> of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentinean corvette Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Nordenskiöld. In search of more permanent employment, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the back-door route of the Supplementary List, but despite the sponsorship of Markham and {{of the president of the}} Royal Society, he was not successful. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the Royal Magazine, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward.|$|E

Given the hair color, eye color, and skin {{color of the}} input body, plus a wardrobe of clothing items, our <b>outfit</b> synthesis system suggests a set of <b>outfits</b> subject to a particular dress code. We introduce a probabilistic framework for modeling and applying dress codes that exploits a Bayesian network trained on example images of real-world <b>outfits.</b> Suitable <b>outfits</b> are then obtained by optimizing a cost function that guides the selection of clothing items to maximize the color compatibility and dress code suitability. We demonstrate our approach on the four most common dress codes: Casual, Sportswear, Business-Casual, and Business. A perceptual study validated on multiple resultant <b>outfits</b> demonstrates the efficacy of our framework...|$|R
