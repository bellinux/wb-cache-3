500|$|When {{planning}} the development, Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure {{that would be}} an icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery, as well as providing spectators with good sightlines in an atmospheric arena. Arup Associates designed the stadium to be [...] "an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club" [...] with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres. The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and <b>openable</b> louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to high-tech architecture.|$|E

Argent worked with BT to provide 'green' features such as an upflow air conditioning system with heat recovery, <b>openable</b> windows and energy saving lighting and controls.

In {{consequence}} of which, people wrote by Dresden, and not the direct way, in future; wishing to avoid that <b>openable</b> FELLEISEN. Next morning, January 6th, his Majesty had left for Ohlau,--early, I suppose; though there proved to be nothing dangerous ahead there, after all.|$|E
5000|$|Interior doors {{should be}} closed and secured to {{restrict}} a child's {{access to such}} areas as garages, basements, laundry rooms, home offices & gyms, bathrooms, or any other potentially hazardous area. Many different types of door latches are available from simple door knob covers to top-of-door latches that can be operated {{from both sides of}} the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other <b>openables</b> to prevent easy opening.

50|$|Another type of lock is an {{inexpensive}} device {{which can be}} easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other <b>openables</b> to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated {{on the inside of}} the drawer or cabinet. The hook catches on part of the drawer or door and prevents opening unless the rod is bent downward simultaneously to disengage the hook. These devices are helpful to pet owners as well — a typical housecat may be able to paw open a cabinet filled with food, but would have trouble operating the hook mechanism. Also available are electromagnetic cabinet locking devices that are activated via remote control.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.130] {{longing to}} mount a camel. The Shaykh’s illness was nothing but {{weakness}} {{brought on by the}} hardships of the journey: he attributed it to the hot wind, and to the weight of a bag of dollars which he had attached to his waist-belt. He was a man about forty, long, thin, pale, and of a purely nervous temperament; and a few questions elicited {{the fact that he had}} lately and suddenly given up his daily opium pill. I prepared one for him, placed him in my litter, and persuaded him to stow away his burden in some place where it would be less troublesome. He was my companion for two marches, at the end of which he found his own Shugduf. I never met amongst the Arab citizens a better bred or a better informed man. At Constantinople he had learned a little French, Italian, and Greek; and from the properties of a shrub to the varieties of honey,[FN#5] he was full of “ useful knowledge,” and <b>openable</b> as a dictionary. We parted near Meccah, where I met him only once, and then accidentally, in the Valley of Muna. 	 At half-past five A.M. on Tuesday, the 6th of September, we rose refreshed by the cool, comfortable night, and loaded the camels. I had an opportunity of inspecting Al-Sufayna. It is a village of fifty or sixty mud-walled, flat-roofed houses, defended by the usual rampart. Around it lie ample date-grounds, and fields of wheat, barley, and maize. Its bazar at this season of the year is well supplied: even fowls can be procured.|$|E
60|$|As, {{whenever}} the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother {{took it to}} be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, <b>openable</b> all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of preserved tamarinds and ginger. Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a uniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach. The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their acerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various slender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed. Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a stock of cordials: whence issued whispers of Seville Orange, Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have undergone a saccharine transfiguration.|$|E

50|$|During the quake, they {{discover}} that the door seal of Togra's shrine, the research lab of the great Togra himself, has opened despite only being <b>openable</b> by Togra.

50|$|The {{wooden screen}} with <b>openable</b> windows gives shade and {{protection}} from the hot summer sun, while allowing the cool air from the street to flow through. The designs of the latticework are usually with smaller opening in the bottom part and larger openings in the higher parts, hence causing the draft to be fast above the head and slow in lower parts.

5000|$|Some older AC Transit buses are not air-conditioned. However, in 2007 the District's {{board of}} {{directors}} voted to purchase new buses equipped with air conditioning. Generally, the recent (2013 and later) models of Gillig and New Flyer vehicles and the older large MCI buses feature air conditioning, while the NABI and most Van Hool buses do not.

50|$|The look of {{the truck}} is {{different}} due to a new, custom-built superstructure, which is fixed on the front structure of the safety arc and the rear structure.

50|$|Hexagonal window (also Melnikov's or {{honeycomb}} window) is a hexagon-shaped window, {{resembling a}} bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite.

Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, {{but it can also}} be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings. The hexagonal window is relatively rare and associated with such architectural styles as constructivism, functionalism, and, occasionally, cubism.|$|E

Internal doors are four panelled and have <b>openable</b> transom lights above. The bathroom, created by the partial enclosure of the verandah, is lined in fibrous cement sheeting and has hollow-core doors. Timber floorboards throughout the residence have been overlaid with carpet.|$|E
