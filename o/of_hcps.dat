40|$|Background: The type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) {{has emerged}} as a protein secretion system important to several Gramnegative bacterial species. One of the common components of the system is Hcp, initially described as a hemolysin coregulated protein in a serotype O 17 strain of Vibrio cholerae. Homologs to V. cholerae hcp genes have been found in all characterized type VI secretion systems and they are present also in the serotype O 1 strains of V. cholerae that are the cause of cholera diseases but seemed to have non-functional T 6 SS. Methodology/Principal Findings: The serotype O 1 V. cholerae strain A 1552 was shown to express detectable levels <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> as determined by immunoblot analyses using polyclonal anti-Hcp antiserum. We found that the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> was growth phase dependent. The levels <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> in quorum sensing deficient mutants of V. cholerae were compared with the levels in wild type V. cholerae O 1 strain A 1552. The expression <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> was positively and negatively regulated by the quorum sensing regulators HapR and LuxO, respectively. In addition, we observed that expression <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> was dependent on the cAMP-CRP global transcriptional regulatory complex and required the RpoN sigma factor. Conclusion/Significance: Our results show that serotype O 1 strains of V. cholerae do express Hcp which is {{regarded as one of the}} important T 6 SS components and is one of the secreted substrates in non-O 1 non-O 139 V. cholerae isolates. We found that expression <b>of</b> <b>Hcp</b> was strictly regulated by the quorum sensing system in the V. cholerae O 1 strain.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} lack of knowledge among health care providers (HCPs) is a challenge to effective EID. Little is known on the knowledge and skills of health care providers in Malawi. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the knowledge and skills <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> on EID of HIV in Mzuzu, Malawi. Objectives: (i) to examine the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> on EID of HIV; and (ii) to determine the skills <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> on EID of HIV. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design with a quantitative approach was used. The study was conducted in three hospitals in Mzuzu, Malawi. The population was HCPs (doctors, nurses/midwives, clinical officers and medical assistants) working in maternity, paediatric wards and under-five clinics. A total of 68 HCPs participated in the study. A closed-ended self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science version 23. Descriptive statistics were used to present the frequency tables of observations. Ethical approval was sought from the University of the Western Cape Senate Research Committee and Malawi National Health Research Council. Results: The results on the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> demonstrate that 38 % of them had a score of 80 % (good). Results on the skills showed that 69 % of the HCPs scored 80 % (good).

40|$|Hantavirus {{cardiopulmonary}} syndrome (HCPS) is {{a life-threatening}} respiratory disease characterized by profound pulmonary edema and myocardial depression. Most cases <b>of</b> <b>HCPS</b> in North America {{are caused by}} Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is carried asymptomatically by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The underlying pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>HCPS</b> is poorly understood. We hypothesized that pathogenic SNV infection results in increased generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), which contribute to the morbidity and mortality <b>of</b> <b>HCPS.</b> Human disease following infection with SNV or Andes virus was associated with increased nitrotyrosine (NT) adduct formation in the lungs, heart, and plasma and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lungs compared to the results obtained for normal human volunteers. In contrast, NT formation was not increased in the lungs or cardiac tissue from SNV-infected deer mice, even {{at the time of}} peak viral antigen expression. In a murine (Mus musculus) model <b>of</b> <b>HCPS</b> (infection of NZB/BLNJ mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13), HCPS-like disease was associated with elevated expression of iNOS in the lungs and NT formation in plasma, cardiac tissue, and the lungs. In this model, intraperitoneal injection of 1400 W, a specific iNOS inhibitor, every 12 h during infection significantly improved survival without affecting intrapulmonary fluid accumulation or viral replication, suggesting that cardiac damage may instead be the cause of mortality.

40|$|Abstract Background As {{a number}} of {{commentators}} have noted, SARS exposed the vulnerabilities of our health care systems and governance structures. Health care professionals (HCPs) and hospital systems that bore {{the brunt of the}} SARS outbreak continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis. Indeed, HCPs – both in clinical care and in public health – were severely tested by SARS. Unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise, and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried. Many were exposed to serious risk of morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by the World Health Organization figures showing that approximately 30 % of reported cases were among HCPs, some of whom died from the infection. Despite this challenge, professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks, thus providing no guidance on what is expected <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> or how they ought to approach their duty to care in the face of risk. Discussion In the aftermath of SARS and with the spectre of a pandemic avian influenza, it is imperative that we (re) consider the obligations <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> for patients with severe infectious diseases, particularly diseases that pose risks to those providing care. It is of pressing importance that organizations representing HCPs give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members {{in the event of a}} pandemic. In this paper, we address the issue of special obligations <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> during an infectious disease outbreak. We argue that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> in the current context of pandemic flu preparedness, and that these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics. Finally, we present a brief historical accounting of the treatment of the duty to care in professional health care codes of ethics. Summary An honest and critical examination of the role <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> during communicable disease outbreaks is needed in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities, as well as ethical duties and obligations. With this paper, we hope to open the social dialogue and advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue. </p...|$|E

I refer to them as: the Trainwreck Paradox, the Jeopardy Paradox, and the Maximum Miti-gation Paradox. The Trainwreck Paradox states that HCPs are needed to avert the listing of species as threatened or endangered, but federal listings are needed to motivate landowners to develop HCPs. The Jeopardy Paradox stems from the vague language of section 10 (a) which allows an HCP to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a species ’ survival and recovery but establishes no objective limit on the magni-tude of reduction. The Maximum Mitigation Paradox argues that if a landowner provides maximum mitigation at the onset of an HCP, then there will be no financial resources for adaptive management in the future, but if resources are reserved for adaptive management, then the landowner is not mitigating to the maximum extent prac-ticable as required by section 10 (a). The {{purpose of this article is}} to explain these paradoxes <b>of</b> <b>HCPs</b> and discuss potential remedies...|$|E
40|$|When {{analysing}} the secretome of {{the plant}} pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC 3000, we identified hemolysin co-regulated protein (<b>Hcp)</b> as one <b>of</b> the secreted proteins. Hcp {{is assumed to be}} an extracellular component of the type VI secretion system (T 6 SS). Two copies <b>of</b> <b>hcp</b> genes are present in the Pst DC 3000 genome, hcp 1 (PSPTO_ 2539) and hcp 2 (PSPTO_ 5435). We studied the expression patterns <b>of</b> <b>hcp</b> genes and tested the fitness <b>of</b> <b>hcp</b> knock-out mutants in host plant colonization and in inter-microbial competition. We found that the hcp 2 gene is expressed, most actively at the stationary growth phase, and that the Hcp 2 protein is secreted via T 6 SS and appears in the culture medium as covalently linked dimers. Expression <b>of</b> <b>hcp</b> 2 is not induced in planta and it does not contribute to virulence or colonisation in tomato or Arabidopsis plants. Instead, hcp 2 is required for survival in competition with enterobacteria and yeasts, and its function is associated with suppression of the growth of these competitors. This is the first report on bacterial T 6 SS-associated genes functioning in competition against yeast. Our results suggest that the T 6 SS of P. syringae may {{play an important role in}} bacterial fitness, allowing this plant pathogen to survive in conditions where it has to compete with other micro-organisms for resources...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{the size}} and ratio <b>of</b> <b>HCP</b> to FCC phase in {{synthesized}} flower-like Ag nanostructures are well controlled by tuning the amount of catalyzing agent ammonia added to the solution. There indeed exists an optimal point where HCP is the richest. Ionic surfactants may have an adverse effect on the formation <b>of</b> <b>HCP</b> phase through its influence on the oxidation product of aldehyde group. The flower-like Ag NPs can be employed as SERS substrate, and the SERS enhancement factor is related to amounts of hot spots and has no direct relation with phase composition.|$|R
