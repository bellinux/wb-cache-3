50|$|Bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight</b> (BOB) is a {{fungal disease}} that is {{relatively}} new to the plant pathogen landscape. BOB started to appear in Midwestern states in the 1990s. The first few diagnoses pointed to a common fungus, Tubakia dryina, as the culprit. However upon further research BOB {{was said to be}} caused by a new unnamed species of Tubakia, later named ‘’Tubakia iowensis T.C. Harr. & D. McNew sp. nov. ‘’ BOB has severe symptoms and is a serious new problem amidst the plant pathology world.|$|E
40|$|Tubakia iowensis was {{recently}} recognized and {{described as the}} causative agent of bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight.</b> The pathogen causes vein necrosis and early season leaf death on Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak). Tubakia sp. B, an undescribed species, was isolated from bur oak and other oaks and {{was found to be}} morphologically indistinguishable from T. iowensis. In chapter 2, T. iowensis and Tubakia sp. B differed in causing a greater amount of necrosis on inoculated leaf blade tissue and in causing less petiole death and fewer conidiomata (pustules) after inoculation of expanding shoots. Both Tubakia spp. caused vein necrosis, but Tubakia sp. B was better at causing leaf spots, and T. iowensis was better at infecting petioles and preventing petiole abscission. Thus, T. iowensis appears to have a narrower ecological niche. Reports of bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight</b> appear to correspond with the geographic range of Q. macrocarpa var. oliviformis. However, even in the upland sites, there is substantial variation in symptom severity among trees within a stand. In chapter 3, seed sources were collected from within the geographic ranges of Q. macrocarpa var. oliviformis, Q. macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, and Q. macrocarpa var. depressa. Seedlings from blighted and healthy Q. macrocarpa trees also were inoculated to test the hypothesis that there is variation in resistance to bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight.</b> Greenhouse inoculations demonstrated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the number of symptomatic leaves or seedlings with petiole pustules among the different varieties of Q. macrocarpa. Seedlings from trees with bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight</b> showed no difference in production of petiole pustules when compared to seedlings from healthy trees in the same stand...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{diseases}} in eastern USA, laurel wilt (caused by Raffaelea lauricola T. C. Harr., Fraedrich & Aghayeva) and bur <b>oak</b> <b>blight</b> (BOB, caused by Tubakia iowensis T. C. Harr. & D. McNew), recently {{have appeared in}} eastern USA. A new disease on a native host suggests that the pathogen is exotic or {{that there has been}} a substantial change in the environment that favors pathogen over host. A few principles help distinguish between the two. Introduced pathogens generally go through severe genetic bottlenecks and show limited diversity compared to native pathogens. Also, in native pathosystems, especially with foliage diseases, susceptible host populations typically show substantial variation in resistance, with resistant and susceptible individuals in proportion to the disease pressure, often determined in part by rainfall and humidity. Mortality of redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng.) on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, was first noticed in 2003. Although initially attributed to drought, Steve Fraedrich of the US Forest Service found that the affected trees had vascular streaking typical of a wilt disease. True vascular wilt diseases (systemic colonization of the host through non-living vessels in the early stages) are generally rare on native trees. Cultures of an unusual fungus with a slimy yeast phase were isolated from the xylem discoloration and sent to Iowa for identification. Analysis of rDNA sequences showed that the fungus was related t...|$|E
50|$|Selly <b>Oak</b> was <b>blighted</b> in {{the late}} 20th century by a road-widening scheme for the Bristol Road (A38). Many {{historic}} buildings, {{the offices of the}} Birmingham Battery and Metal Company and the Westley Richards Gun Factory, were demolished. However, plans for a major regeneration of the area were confirmed in 2005 and a new 1.5 km stretch of road was opened in August 2011 to access the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. The work has involved the construction of the Aerial aqueduct to carry the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and a railway viaduct for the Cross-City Line. This scheme has {{paved the way for the}} enhancement of the Battery Retail Park shopping complex and a number of familiar ‘High Street’ shops have opened stores.|$|R
6000|$|An ancient {{minstrel}} sagely said, [...] "Where is {{the life}} which late we led?" [...] That motley clown in Arden wood, Whom humorous Jaques with envy viewed, Not even that clown could amplify, On this trite text, so long as I. Eleven years we now may tell, Since we {{have known each other}} well; Since, riding side by side, our hand, First drew the voluntary brand; And sure, through many a varied scene, Unkindness never came between. Away these winged years have flown, To join the mass of ages gone; And though deep marked, like all below, With checkered shades of joy and woe; Though thou o'er realms and seas hast ranged, Marked cities lost, and empires changed, While here, at home, my narrower ken Somewhat of manners saw, and men; Though varying wishes, hopes, and fears, Fevered the progress of these years, Yet now, days, weeks, and months but seem The recollection of a dream, So still we glide down to the sea Of fathomless eternity. [...] Even now it scarcely seems a day, Since first I tuned this idle lay; A task so often thrown aside, When leisure graver cares denied, That now, November's dreary gale, Whose voice inspired my opening tale, That same November gale once more Whirls the dry leaves on Yarrow shore. Their vexed boughs streaming to the sky, Once more our naked birches sigh, And Blackhouse heights, and Ettrick Pen, Have donned their wintry shrouds again: And mountain dark, and flooded mead, Bid us forsake the banks of Tweed. Earlier than wont along the sky, Mixed with the rack, the snow mists fly; The shepherd, who in summer sun, Had something of our envy won, As thou with pencil, I with pen, The features traced of hill and glen; - He who, outstretched the livelong day, At ease among the heath-flowers lay, Viewed the light clouds with vacant look, Or slumbered o'er his tattered book, Or idly busied him to guide His angle o'er the lessened tide; - At midnight now, the snowy plain Finds sterner labour for the swain. [...] When red hath set the beamless sun, Through heavy vapours dark and dun; When the tired ploughman, dry and warm, Hears, half-asleep, the rising storm Hurling the hail, and sleeted rain, Against the casement's tinkling pane; The sounds that drive wild deer, and fox, To shelter in the brake and rocks, Are warnings which the shepherd ask To dismal and to dangerous task. Oft he looks forth, and hopes, in vain, The blast may sink in mellowing rain; Till, dark above, and white below, Decided drives the flaky snow, And forth the hardy swain must go. Long, with dejected look and whine, To leave the hearth his dogs repine; Whistling and cheering them to aid, Around his back he wreathes the plaid: His flock he gathers, and he guides, To open downs, and mountain-sides, Where, fiercest though the tempest blow, Least deeply lies the drift below. The blast that whistles o'er the fells, Stiffens his locks to icicles; Oft he looks back, while, streaming far, His cottage window seems a star - Loses its feeble gleam,--and then Turns patient to the blast again, And, facing to the tempest's sweep, Drives through the gloom his lagging sheep. If fails his heart, if his limbs fail, Benumbing death is in the gale: His paths, his landmarks, all unknown, Close to the hut, no more his own, Close to the aid he sought in vain, The morn may find the stiffened swain: The widow sees, at dawning pale, His orphans raise their feeble wail: And, close beside him, in the snow, Poor Yarrow, partner of their woe, Couches upon his master's breast, And licks his cheek to break his rest. [...] Who envies now the shepherd's lot, His healthy fare, his rural cot, His summer couch by greenwood tree, His rustic kirn's loud revelry, His native hill-notes tuned on high, To Marion of the blithesome eye; His crook, his scrip, his oaten reed, And all Arcadia's golden creed? [...] Changes not so with us, my Skene, Of human life the varying scene? Our youthful summer oft we see Dance by on wings of game and glee, While the dark storm reserves its rage, Against the winter of our age: As he, the ancient Chief of Troy, His manhood spent in peace and joy; But Grecian fires, and loud alarms, Called ancient Priam forth to arms. Then happy those, since each must drain His share of pleasure, share of pain, Then happy those, beloved of Heaven, To whom the mingled cup is given; Whose lenient sorrows find relief, Whose joys are chastened by their grief. And such a lot, my Skene, was thine, When thou, of late, wert doomed to twine - Just when thy bridal hour was by - The cypress with the myrtle tie. Just on thy bride her sire had smiled, And blessed the union of his child, When Love must change its joyous cheer, And wipe Affection's filial tear. Nor did the actions next his end, Speak more the father than the friend: Scarce had lamented Forbes paid The tribute to his minstrel's shade; The tale of friendship scarce was told, Ere the narrator's heart was cold - Far may we search before we find A heart so manly and so kind! But not around his honoured urn Shall friends alone and kindred mourn; The thousand eyes his care had dried, Pour at his name a bitter tide; And frequent falls the grateful dew, For benefits the world ne'er knew. If mortal charity dare claim The Almighty's attributed name, Inscribe above his mouldering clay, [...] "The widow's shield, the orphan's stay." [...] Nor, though it wake thy sorrow, deem My verse intrudes on this sad theme; For sacred was the pen that wrote, [...] "Thy father's friend forget thou not:" [...] And grateful title may I plead, For many a kindly word and deed, To bring my tribute to his grave:- 'Tis little--but 'tis all I have. [...] To thee, perchance, this rambling strain Recalls our summer walks again; When, doing naught--and, to speak true, Not anxious to find aught to do - The wild unbounded hills we ranged, While oft our talk its topic changed, And, desultory as our way, Ranged, unconfined, from grave to gay. Even when it flagged, as oft will chance, No effort made to break its trance, We could right pleasantly pursue Our sports in social silence too; Thou gravely labouring to portray The <b>blighted</b> <b>oak's</b> fantastic spray; I spelling o'er, with much delight, The legend of that antique knight, Tirante by name, ycleped the White. At either's feet a trusty squire, Pandour and Camp, with eyes of fire, Jealous, each other's motions viewed, And scarce suppressed their ancient feud. The laverock whistled from the cloud; The stream was lively, but not loud; From the white thorn the Mayflower shed Its dewy fragrance round our head: Not Ariel lived more merrily Under the blossomed bough than we. [...] And blithesome nights, too, have been ours, When winter stript the summer's bowers. Careless we heard, what now I hear, The wild blast sighing deep and drear, When fires were bright, and lamps beamed gay, And ladies tuned the lovely lay; And he was held a laggard soul, Who shunned to quaff the sparkling bowl. Then he, whose absence we deplore, Who breathes the gales of Devon's shore, The longer missed, bewailed the more; And thou, and I, and dear-loved Rae, And one whose name I may not say - For not Mimosa's tender tree Shrinks sooner from the touch than he - In merry chorus well combined, With laughter drowned the whistling wind. Mirth was within; and Care without Might gnaw her nails to hear our shout. Not but amid the buxom scene Some grave discourse might intervene - Of the good horse that bore him best, His shoulder, hoof, and arching crest: For, like mad Tom's, our chiefest care, Was horse to ride, and weapon wear. Such nights we've had; and, though the game Of manhood be more sober tame, And though the field-day, or the drill, Seem less important now--yet still Such may we hope to share again. The sprightly thought inspires my strain! And mark how, like a horseman true, Lord Marmion's march I thus renew.|$|R
