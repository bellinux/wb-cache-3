5|$|A {{division}} {{developed between}} the uprising's communist {{leadership and the}} nationalists participating. The nationalists recognised the uprising had been crushed and wanted to stop fighting, while the Partisans were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, the nationalists contacted the Italians and <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. The nationalists had closer ties with Serbia and possessed a frontier mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue the uprising by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue fighting the Italians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.|$|E
