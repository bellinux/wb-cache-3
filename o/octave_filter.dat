50|$|Initially, the Monochord and Melochord {{were used}} in the Cologne Studio {{together}} with other equipment. A noise generator provided a rushing-noise signal, like what is heard for example in short-wave radio on frequencies between radio stations. Filters were important for transforming sounds. An <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> attenuates an input signal (like white noise, for example) into several octave-wide frequency bands. Two band-pass filters allow only a single band of frequencies to pass through from an input signal. By using the band-pass filters instead of the <b>octave</b> <b>filter,</b> this band could be adjusted in width and centre frequency. In addition there was as so-called ring modulator, which mixed two input signals multiplictively, in contrast to the additive mixing done with a mixing console. The ring modulator was used for intense sound transformations. An oscilloscope made sounds visible. A four-track tape recorder allowed the synchronisation of several separately produced successions of sounds. Two single-track tape recorders were used to copy one tape to another. By using the mixer, new sounds could be recorded along with those from the first audio tape while copying to the second tape recorder (one of Meyer-Eppler’s key ideas). The mixer consisted of two groups of eight channels each. It had remote controls for the four-track tape recorder and the <b>octave</b> <b>filter.</b> In addition, the inputs and outputs of all sound sources, filters, and modulators converged here, in a cross-plug-in busbar panel, so that the connections of the individual devices with one another could easily be established and modified as needed.|$|E

In brief, we first filter the speech signal with 15 gammatone filters (roughly equivalent to one-third <b>octave</b> <b>filters)</b> and we process the Hilbert envelope of the output of the gammatone filters with nine modulation spectrum filters [19]. The 135 -dimensional (135 -D) output of this system can be sampled at any rate that is an integer fraction of the sampling frequency of the input speech signal. For the conversion of the 135 -D output to posterior probability estimates of a set of states, we use the sparse coding (SC) approach proposed by [20]. Sparse coding is best conceived of as an exemplar-based approach [21] in which unknown inputs are coded as positive (weighted) sums of items in an exemplar dictionary.|$|R

One accepted model is often called the critical band model, which shows how signals psychoacoustically mask one another, {{as long as they are}} within a critical band [Zwicker, 1990]. A close approximation to the critical bands of hearing is a third <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> bank, which is designed in this paper.

This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with <b>octave</b> band <b>filters,</b> one-third <b>octave</b> band <b>filters</b> or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for <b>octave</b> band <b>filters,</b> and when Bt≈ 3 for one-third <b>octave</b> band <b>filters.</b> Four different commercially-available sound level meters are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or one-third octave bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R

30|$|In {{designing}} the modulation spectrum analysis system, {{a number of}} decisions {{had to be made}} about implementation details. Although we are confident that all our decisions were reasonable (and supported by data from the literature), we cannot claim that they were optimal. Most data in the literature on modulation spectra are based on perception experiments with human subjects, {{but more often than not}} these experiments use auditory stimuli that are very different from speech. While the results of those experiments surely provide guidance for ASR, it may well be that the automatic processing aimed at extracting the discriminative information is so different from what humans do that some of our decisions are sub-optimal. Our gammatone filterbank contains 15 one-third <b>octave</b> <b>filters,</b> which have a higher resolution in the frequencies < 500 Hz than the Mel filterbank that is used in most ASR systems. However, initial experiments in which we compared our one-third octave filterbank with a filterbank consisting of 23 Mel-spaced gammatone filters, spanning the frequency range of 64 to 3, 340 Hz did not show a significant advantage of the latter over the former. From the speech technology’s point of view, this may seem surprising because the narrow-band filters of the one-third octave filterbank in the low frequencies may cause interactions with fundamental frequency, while the relatively broad filters in the higher frequencies cannot resolve formants. But from an auditory system’s point of view, there is no such surprise, since one-third <b>octave</b> <b>filters</b> are compatible with most, if not all, outcomes of psycho-acoustic experiments. This is also true for experiments that focused on speech intelligibility [1].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and automated method of correcting baseline shifts in seismic acceleration records. The method {{focuses on the}} recovery of the low frequency ‘fling ’ from the acceleration record. The recovery of the fling makes double time integration to displacement much easier. Basically the wavelet transform can be described as a cascade of <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> banks, down-sampling to lower frequency sub-bands until the sub-band containing the low frequency fling is reached. The algorithm also implements a de-noising scheme, which removes low and higher frequency outliers thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The wavelets used for this analysis are bi-orthogonal, these have linear phase, though other wavelets perform as well. On recovering the low frequency fling and double time integrating, offsets in frequency and linear and quadratic trends in displacement are manifest, but at low frequencies these are straightforward to correct. The resulting trends are in the main due to instantaneous tilts and the method is able to recover these tilts. The algorithm simply locates the zero crossing point in the velocity time history and performs a simple correction. The events used in this paper are from the 1999 Chi-Chi event and the 2008 Iceland event. The method also lends itself to estimating instantaneous tilts...|$|E

Range of Investigation. [...] Curves of noise level in decibels against frequency have been obtained for eight aeroplanes, in various flight conditions, at different crew stations, and on one aeroplane with and without soundproofing. These curves have been examined in conjunction with details of the geometry of the aeroplanes, the frequencies of airscrew and engine rotation and of the engine explosions, and assessments of the aeroplane noise made by pilots and observers. Conclusions. [...] The principal sources of noise are airscrew rotation and engine exhaust at low frequencies and aerodynamic noise at high frequencies; in certain cases, other factors such as airscrew torsional vibration and engine vibrations appear to contribute. The noise level to be expected can be predicted roughly from a consideration of the distance of the crew stations from exhausts and airscrews, the area of perspex present, the aerodynamic cleanness of the windscreen and the degree of soundproofing.

30|$|A SIP 95 {{sound level}} meter was used to record {{acoustic}} data. The measurement system is inspected every two years {{and approved by the}} French National Laboratory for testing in accordance with international standards. The microphone is positioned at 4 m above the ground to comply with the requirement of the free field condition. The ground is flat and consists of grass shorter without brush, wood or obstacles. Two calibrations are performed every day. The free-field sensitivity level of the microphone and preamplifier in the reference direction, at frequencies over at least the range of one-third-octave nominal mid-band frequencies from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive, is within 1.0 dB of that at the calibration check frequency, and within 2.0 dB for nominal mid-band frequencies of 6.3 kHz, 8 kHz and 10 kHz. The output of the analysis system consists of one-third octave band sound pressure levels as a function of time, obtained by processing the noise signals with the following characteristics: a set of 24 one-third octave band filters [50 Hz– 10 kHz]; response and averaging properties in which the output from any one-third <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> band is squared, averaged and displayed or stored as time-averaged sound pressure levels; the interval between successive sound pressure level samples is 500 ms 5 ms for spectral analysis with or without slow time-weighting. Ambient noise, including both an acoustical background and electrical noise of the measurement system was recorded for 10 minutes a day with the system gain set at the levels used for the aircraft noise measurements. The recorded aircraft noise data is acceptable according to international standards. The exclusion criteria of the recorded data are: days on which a strike took place and special weather conditions (gusty winds, stormy rainfall, atmospheric turbulence, etc.). According to the measurement specifications, we identified and retained 15460 turbojet aircraft approaching the airport in the same conditions representing 84.5 % (+ 20 T) of the air traffic (15 % of the air traffic represents propeller aircraft (3 – 9 T and + 20 T) and 0.5 % others (− 3 T and 3 − 9 T)).

30|$|For {{a recent}} review {{of the range of}} {{approaches}} that has been taken towards noise-robust ASR, we refer to [17]. Here, we focus on one set of approaches, guided by the finding that humans have less trouble recognizing speech in noise, which seems to suggest that humans are either better in source separation or in latching on to the speech information that is not obscured by the noise (or in both). This suggests that there is something in the auditory processing system that makes it possible to deal with additive noise. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} replacing the conventional short-time spectral analysis based on the fast Fourier transform by the output of a principled auditory model should improve robustness against noise. However, up to now, the results of research along this line have failed to live up to the promise [18]. We believe that this is at least in part caused by the fact that in previous research, the output of an auditory model was converted to the equivalent of the energy in one-third <b>octave</b> <b>filters,</b> necessary for interfacing with a conventional ASR back end, but without trying to capture the continuity constraints imposed by the articulatory system. In this conversion most of the additional information carried by the modulation spectrum is lost.|$|R

This project presents the design of an audio graphic equalizer using digital filters and signal processing. Graphic equalizers are traditionally designed with a bank of bandpass filters spaced in frequency by octaves or fractions of octaves. The design in this project uses 10 bandpass filters with frequencies related by octaves to cover the entire audio range. The system designed emphasizes the application of state of the art digital signal processing hardware to audio equipment. The signal processor AMI S 2811 is used as the heart of the system due to its fast processing speed and flexible instruction set. The speed, however, is not enough to process ten filters in a sampling period. To solve this problem, a scheme is used whereby a basic digital bandpass filter is sampled at successively halved rates to generate all the lower <b>octave</b> <b>filters.</b> Digital lowpass filters are interposed to prevent aliasing. With this scheme, only two bandpass and two lowpass filters need be processed per each sampling period.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify fundamental limitations on spatial acuity that result from image motion. Discrimination of Vernier offset was measured for a pair of vertical abutting lines and letter resolution was measured using a four-orientation letter ‘T’. These stimuli were digitally filtered using one of five band-pass (bandwidth= 1. 5 <b>octaves)</b> <b>filters</b> with a center frequency between 0. 83 and 13. 2 c/deg, and presented at velocities that ranged from 0 to 12 deg/s. Filtered and unfiltered stimuli were presented for 150 ms at a constant multiple (4 × or 2 ×) of the contrast-detection threshold at each velocity. For stimuli of low to middle spatial frequency (up to 3. 3 c/deg), Vernier and letter acuity for equally detectable targets are essentially unaffected by velocity up to 12 deg/s, i. e., for temporal frequencies of motion (velocity×spatial frequency) up to approximately 50 Hz. For stimuli of higher spatial frequency, acuity remains essentially constant until the velocity corresponds to a temporal frequency of about 30 Hz, and increases thereafter. Both Vernier and letter acuities worsen by approximately a factor of two for each one-octave decrease in filter spatial frequency. Both types of acuities worsen also as the contrast of the stimulus is reduced, but Vernier discrimination exhibits a stronger contrast-dependence than letter resolution. Our results support previous suggestions that a shift in the spatial scale used by the visual system to analyze spatial stimuli is principally responsible for the degradation of acuity in the presence of image motion. The results are consistent with a spatio-temporal-frequency limitation on spatial thresholds for moving stimuli, and not with a temporal-frequency limitation per se...|$|R

5000|$|In {{electronic}} filters, {{the trade-off}} between frequency domain response and time domain ringing artifacts is well-illustrated by the Butterworth filter: the frequency response of a Butterworth filter slopes down linearly on the log scale, with a first-order filter having slope of −6 dB per <b>octave,</b> a second-order <b>filter</b> -12 dB per octave, and an nth order filter having slope of [...] dB per octave - in the limit, this approaches a brick-wall filter. Thus, among these the, first-order filter rolls off slowest, and hence exhibits the fewest time domain artifacts, but leaks {{the most in}} the stopband, while as order increases, the leakage decreases, but artifacts increase.|$|R
5000|$|The Langevin Model EQ-251A was {{the first}} {{equalizer}} to use slide controls. It featured two passive equalization sections, a bass shelving filter, and a pass band filter. Each filter had switchable frequencies and used a 15-position slide switch to adjust cut or boost. The first true graphic equalizer was the type 7080 developed by Art Davis's Cinema Engineering. It featured 6 bands with a boost or cut range of 8 dB. It used a slide switch to adjust each band in 1 dB steps. Davis's second graphic equalizer was the Altec Lansing Model 9062A EQ. In 1967 Davis developed the first 1/3 <b>octave</b> variable notch <b>filter</b> set, the Altec-Lansing [...] "Acousta-Voice" [...] system.|$|R
40|$|The {{binaural}} {{synthesis of}} acoustical environments {{is based on}} binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) measured with a dummy head for discrete head positions and angular resolutions of typically between 1 °and 15 °. The resolution of the BRIR grid defines {{the size of the}} BRIR database as well as the duration of its measurement. To determine the minimum grid resolution required for dynamic binaural synthesis a listening test was performed. Following an adaptive 3 AFC procedure, a spatial grid of BRIR data was gradually coarsened from a maximum resolution of 1 ° / 1 ° until audible artefacts were introduced. Thresholds of audibility were tested for a sound source located at 0 ° / 0 ° with dynamical auralization in two rotational degrees of freedom. The datasets used were acquired in an anechoic environment and in two rooms of different size and reverberation time. Pink noise and acoustical guitar were used as stimuli. A third <b>octave</b> band <b>filter</b> bank analysis of the data sets, using a 1 dB-deviation-in-a-band criterion for the audibility of spectral differences, was in good accordance with the listening test results...|$|R
