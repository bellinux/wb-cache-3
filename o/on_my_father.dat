2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Gira {{hinted at}} the {{prospect}} of resurrecting the Swans project. Later that year, many of the tracks that would appear <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky were released in demo and acoustic form [...] on I Am Not Insane and sold in order to fund the recording process for this album. Gira handmade 1,000 copies of that album to fund the new Swans recordings. In January 2010, Gira amended the band's Facebook and MySpace to read [...] "SWANS ARE NOT DEAD"—an announcement that the band had been reformed as well as a play on words from Swans' live album Swans Are Dead.|$|E
2500|$|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) {{has been}} {{suspected}} of trafficking underage women across state lines, {{as well as}} across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, {{for the purpose of}} sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual abuse. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: [...] "In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity." [...] According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute {{may not be able to}} be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change. Former FLDS members have also alleged that children belonging to the sect were forced to perform sexual acts as children upon older men while being unable to leave. This has been described by numerous former members as sexual slavery, and was reported as such by the Sydney Morning Herald, One former resident of Yearning for Zion, Kathleen Mackert, stated: [...] "I was required to perform oral sex <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> when I was seven, and it escalated from there." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{a day or}} {{two after}} that I rested at Jane's, lest I should disturb my brain too much.

6000|$|... "He was so obliging as {{to suggest}} my father for your tutor, and he called <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to propose it.

60|$|I had sensations, I had thoughts, I had visions, now--but {{they all}} acted in the frightful self-concentration of delirium.
