The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: Santa Monica, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning.

5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game, such as triggering a sand avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed. Sand sometimes <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E

As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea.

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissnerâ€“NordstrÃ¶m solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmannâ€“LemaÃ®treâ€“Robertsonâ€“Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the GÃ¶del universe (which <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E

The NY55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into Amenia, where an overlap with NY343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic, the most distant Metro-North station from the city in direct miles. Route343 remains joined with Route22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, US44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with Route22. The valley <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes by the large Coleman Station Historic District.|$|E
