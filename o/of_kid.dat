5|$|The {{electronic}} music <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> A and Amnesiac {{was inspired by}} Yorke's admiration for {{electronic music}} exemplified by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th century classical music also had a role, as the influence of composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen was apparent; since the recording <b>of</b> <b>Kid</b> A, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen.|$|E
