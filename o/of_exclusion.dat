United States, 320 U.S. 115 (1943) was a United States Supreme Court case {{regarding}} {{the constitutionality of}} curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> along the West Coast of the United States where Japanese-Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese sentiment in the country.|$|E

After {{two years}} of combat neutrality, the United States was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese-Americans by issuing Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This executive order authorized the military to create zones <b>of</b> <b>exclusion,</b> which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.|$|E

40|$|From ostracism on the {{playground}} to romantic rejection, bullying at work, and social disregard for the aged, individuals are at constant risk of experiencing instances <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> including ostracism, rejection, dehumanization, and discrimination. These phenomena have a powerful impact as testified by their immediate influence on people’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Social Exclusion: Psychological Approaches to Understanding and Reducing Its Impact investigates different psychological approaches, across multiple psychological subdisciplines, to understanding the causes and consequences <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> and possible ways to reduce or buffer against its negative effects. The purpose of this volume is threefold. First, it lays {{the groundwork for the}} understanding <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> research; reviewing the different instances <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> in everyday life and methods to experimentally investigate them. Second, this volume brings together different psychological approaches to the topic <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> Leading scholars from around the world contribute perspectives from social psychology, social neuroscience, developmental psychology, educational psychology, work and organizational psychology, clinical psychology, and social gerontology to provide a comprehensive overview <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> research in different psychological subdisciplines. Taken together, these chapters are conducive to the important development of new and more integrative research models on social exclusion. Finally, this volume discusses psychological strategies such as emotion regulation, psychological resources, and brain mechanisms that can reduce or buffer against the negative consequences <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> From school shootings to domestic violence, from cognitive impairment to suicide attempts, the negative impact <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> has been widely documented. Thus, from an applied perspective, knowing potential ways to mitigate the negative effects <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> can have a significant positive influence on people’s—and society’s—well-being. Overall, this book provides the reader with the knowledge to understand the impact <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> and with tools to address it across many different contexts...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{usefulness}} of the concept <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> for Australian social housing policy. We draw on recent theoretical and empirical research from Europe and the UK to develop a critique of the concept <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> It is argued that any assessment <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> needs to distinguish between its utility as an academic explanatory concept and its political deployment to justify new forms of policy intervention. Policy targeting anti-social behaviour through increasingly more punitive means, for instance, is often justified on the basis that it ameliorates the problems <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> experienced by tenants residing in public housing estates. We conclude that, in spite of the limitations <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> as an analytical concept, for political and pragmatic reasons it is likely to become {{an important component of the}} emerging Australian housing policy agenda...|$|R
