5|$|Samuel Adams {{was born}} in Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts on September 16, 1722, an Old Style date that is {{sometimes}} converted to the New Style date of September 27. Adams was one of twelve children born to Samuel Adams, Sr., and Mary (Fifield) Adams {{in an age of}} high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday. Adams's parents were devout Puritans and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>South</b> Congregational Church. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston. Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially virtue.|$|E
5|$|The redeveloped Hampden {{has held}} the top status with the various UEFA stadium categories, holding {{category}} four status. The Scottish Football Museum, which opened in 2001, is located within Hampden. Part of the museum is the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. A distinctive feature of the old Hampden, the press box which sat on the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>South</b> Stand, is also exhibited at the museum. The offices of the Scottish Football Association, Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League are all located within Hampden.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near the Lawn and boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of these houses cost up to $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>South,</b> using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E
5|$|The UK Government {{eventually}} {{provided a}} grant of £3.5 million in 1992, which allowed work to begin on a £12 million project to convert Hampden into an all-seater stadium. The last match played {{in front of the}} sloping terraces was the 1992 Scottish League Cup Final. Within a year, the east and west ends of the ground had been replaced and the partially rebuilt Hampden was re-opened for a friendly match between Scotland and Netherlands on 23 March 1994. It was then also used for the later stages of the 1993–94 Scottish Cup competition. As the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>South</b> Stand had been limited to 4,500, the total capacity of Hampden had been reduced to approximately 37,000. With Celtic Park also undergoing extensive redevelopment to become all-seater, Celtic spent the 1994–95 season groundsharing at Hampden, at a cost of £500,000 rent.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>South</b> Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E

25|$|Kannada is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>south</b> Indian {{languages}} with an antiquity of {{at least}} 2000 years.

5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>South</b> African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E

In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.|$|E
