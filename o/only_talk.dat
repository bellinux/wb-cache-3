5|$|At Giles' {{apartment}} Xander and Anya argue, as Anya {{is trying}} to get Xander to tell her what she means to him. He is unable to answer her. Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share her interest in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic. A shy woman in the group, Tara Maclay, starts to speak up to support Willow's suggestion, but falls silent when the attention turns to her.|$|E
5|$|In 615, some of Muhammad's {{followers}} {{emigrated to}} the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony {{under the protection of}} the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to Hijra, while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> about one migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|He {{once again}} worked with actress Shinobu Terajima on the 2005 film It's <b>Only</b> <b>Talk,</b> {{returning}} to his concentration {{on the problems of}} modern city life in Japan. The film won Best Film Third Place at the 16th Japanese Professional Movie Awards (2006) and Hiroki was given a Special Award. Also during this period, Hiroki directed two character dramas with sexual themes, L'Amant about a teenaged girl selling herself as a sex slave and M, detailing the experiences of a housewife whose sexual experimentation leads to prostitution.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E

25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E
25|$|His radio {{career began}} in New York City, working as the {{producer}} for the Tex and Jinx interview program from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, a live remote broadcast over WNBC-AM {{in the mid-1950s}} at 10:30 PM to Midnight, Monday through Friday. William Safire hired Farber as a producer. Farber eventually hosted his own show on WINS. Begun in 1960, his first talk show was called Barry Farber’s WINS Open Mike. It was the <b>only</b> <b>talk</b> show on {{what was then a}} rock n’ roll station. He left that job for an evening talk show on WOR-AM in 1962, and then became an all-night host in 1967. In 1970, he ran for Congress in New York City's 19th district on the Republican ticket, but was defeated by Bella Abzug. Farber left his talk-radio career for a time in 1977 to delve into politics, running for mayor of New York City, but was defeated.|$|E

After Maria completes tasks for him, Ernest warns her about James, whom he describes as a [...] "bad man". After Maria opens the door to Ernest's room and finds it empty, she leaves the mansion.

In Lyra's world, it is considered to be [...] "the grossest breach of etiquette imaginable" [...] for one person to touch another's dæmon— this violates the strictest of taboos. [...] "A human being with no dæmon is like someone without a face, or with their ribs laid open and their heart torn out: something unnatural and uncanny that belonged to the world of night-ghasts, not the waking world of sense".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the split}} of SDS in 1969, Oughton and Ayers joined the Weatherman faction. Oughton's sense of herself {{made it more}} {{difficult}} to get along with her father; she saw her parents' lives in Dwight, Illinois as complacent and secure, and lives in the impoverished sections of Chicago and Detroit as chaotic. At this time, SDS protests became more violent and radical. Oughton and Ayers had been drifting apart since December 1968. Monogamy, according to Ayers, would interfere with his political work. Oughton replaced her old friends, and she abandoned teaching, for politics was now her life. Merrill Rosenberg told Oughton, [...] "Revolution means violence and risk, or it is <b>only</b> <b>talk.</b> The Weathermen's arguments pointed to their conclusion that the time was now to fight." ...|$|E
