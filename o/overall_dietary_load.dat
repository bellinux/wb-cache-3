40|$|Although diet is {{believed}} to influence colorectal cancer risk, {{the long-term effects of}} a diet with a high glycemic load are unclear. The growing recog-nition that colorectal cancer may be promoted by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance suggests that a diet inducing high blood glucose levels and an elevated insulin response may con-tribute to a metabolic environment conducive to tumor growth. We pro-spectively followed a cohort of 38 451 women for an average of 7. 9 years and identified 174 with incident colorectal cancer. We used baseline dietary intake measurements, as-sessed with a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire, to examine the associations of <b>dietary</b> glycemic <b>load,</b> <b>overall</b> <b>dietary</b> glycemic index, carbohydrate, fiber, nonfiber carbo-hydrate, sucrose, and fructose with the subsequent development of colo-rectal cancer.

Before applying this method to nutrition data, further analyses {{are required to}} assess its validity in nutritional epidemiology. We aimed to compare dietary patterns from factor analysis and TT and their associations with diabetes incidence. Complete data were available for 7349 women (50 - 55 y at baseline) from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Exploratory factor analysis and TT were performed to obtain patterns by using dietary data collected from an FFQ. Generalized estimating equations analyses were used to examine associations between dietary patterns and diabetes incidence. Two patterns were identified by both methods: a prudent and a Western dietary pattern. Factor analysis factors are a linear combination of all food items, whereas TT factors also include items with zero loading. The Western pattern identified by factor analysis showed a significant positive association with diabetes [highest quintile: OR = 1. 94 (95 % CI: 1. 25, 3. 00); P-trend = 0. 001). Both factor analysis and TT involve different assumptions and subjective decisions. TT produces clearly interpretable factors accounting for almost as much variance as factors from factor analysis. However, TT patterns include food items with zero loading and therefore do not represent <b>overall</b> <b>dietary</b> patterns. The different <b>dietary</b> pattern <b>loading</b> structures identified by both methods result in different conclusions regarding the relationship with diabetes.

However, the higher nutrient adequacy of diets rich in plant protein may also originate from overarching factors associated with more healthful dietary behaviors, such as a greater dietary diversity. Objective: Our main objective {{was to determine whether}} the relation between plant protein intake and nutrient adequacy could be explained, at least in part, by an association with <b>overall</b> <b>dietary</b> diversity. Methods: We used data from 1330 adults participating in the French Nutrition and Health Survey [Etude Nationale Nutrition Sante (ENNS); 2006 - 2007]. With the use of global, integrative approaches, we assessed nutrient adequacy (by using the probabilistic PANDiet (Probability of Adequate Nutrient Intake) scoring system] and <b>overall</b> <b>dietary</b> diversity (by using a 100 -point score that accounts for the relative number of subgroups consumed in 7 food groups). Linear multivariate modeling was used for the analysis. Results: We found a positive association between plant protein (but not total or animal protein) intake and dietary diversity (beta = 0. 08) and a strong positive association between dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy (beta = 0. 33). However, the association between plant protein intake and nutrient adequacy was not explained by dietary diversity (r= 0. 38 and partial r= 0. 36, P < 0. 0001). In multivariate analysis, nutrient adequacy was positively associated with dietary diversity (beta = 0. 44) and plant (beta = 0. 37) and animal (beta = 0. 15) protein intakes. Associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (total energy, energy density, sex, body mass index, income, occupational status, educational level, region, season, and smoking status).

Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether <b>dietary</b> acid <b>load</b> is associated with blood pressure or the incidence of hypertension in older men taking into account each individual’s kidney function. Methods: We included 673 men aged 70 – 71 y and not receiving antihypertensive medication from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men. Of those, 378 men attended re-examination after 7 y. <b>Dietary</b> acid <b>load</b> was estimated at baseline by potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP), based on nutrient intake assessed by 7 -d food records at baseline.

Objective: Our objective was to investigate whether <b>dietary</b> insulin <b>load</b> and <b>dietary</b> insulin index are associated with the risk of pan-creatic cancer. Design: We prospectively followed 86, 740 women and 46, 147 men who were free of cancer and diabetes at baseline in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. During 26 y of follow-up, 691 pancreatic cancer cases were documented. <b>Dietary</b> insulin <b>load</b> was calculated {{as a function of the}} food insulin index, and the energy content of individual foods was reported on food-frequency questionnaires.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{work on the}} nephrotoxicity of contaminants in drinking water using laboratory mice, motivated {{by the need to}} understand the origin of chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology is examined within our understanding of the hydration of ions and proteins. Qualitative considerations based on Hofmeister-type action of these ions, as well as quantitative electrochemical models for the Gibbs free-energy change for ion-pair formation are used to explain why Cd$^{ 2 +}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and water hardness due to Mg$^{ 2 +}$ ions (but not Ca$^{ 2 +}$) can be expected to be more nephrotoxic, while AsO$_ 3 ^{ 3 -}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and hardness may be expected to be less nephrotoxic. The analysis is applied to a variety of ionic species typically found in water to predict their likely combined electro-chemical action. These results clarify the origins of chronic kidney disease in the north-central province of Sri Lanka. The conclusion is further strengthened by a study of the <b>dietary</b> <b>load</b> of Cd and As, where the <b>dietary</b> <b>loads</b> are found to be safe, especially when the mitigating effects of micronutrient ionic forms of Zn and Se, as well as corrections for bio-availability are taken in to account.

FRAP scores and antioxidant intake (i. e., vitamin A, C, E, selenium, flavonoids and carotenoids) was assessed at baseline by a food frequency questionnaire. Incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed through medical reports. During a median follow-up of 17 years, 199 cases with breast cancer were identified. High dietary FRAP score was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR) : 0. 68; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 0. 49, 0. 96]. No overall association between individual antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk was found.
