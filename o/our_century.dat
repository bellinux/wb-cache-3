25|$|I {{wanted to}} write about American mythologies, American yearnings that might be responses, delayed or exaggerated but in some way typical, to the {{political}} and social truths of our part of the world in <b>our</b> <b>century.</b> But I wrote very personally about one family.

2500|$|During the renaissance, {{particularly}} with Bruno, actual infinity transfers from God to the world.

2500|$|Pierre Barousse, {{the curator}} of the Musée Ingres, wrote: ...One realizes in how many ways a variety of artists claim him as their master, from the most plainly {{conventional}} {{of the nineteenth century}} such as Cabanel or Bouguereau, to the most revolutionary of <b>our</b> <b>century</b> from Matisse to Picasso. A classicist? Above all, he was moved by the impulse to penetrate the secret of natural beauty and to reinterpret it through its own means; an attitude fundamentally different to that of David... there results a truly personal and unique art admired as much by the Cubists for its plastic autonomy, as by the Surrealists for its visionary qualities.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>our</b> <b>century,</b> {{observers}} have warmed to the rebel myth of Caravaggio, and often ignore the profound influence on art that Carracci had. Caravaggio almost never worked in fresco, {{regarded as the}} test of a great painter's mettle. On the other hand, Carracci's best works are in fresco. Thus the somber canvases of Caravaggio, with benighted backgrounds, are suited to the contemplative altars, and not to well-lit walls or ceilings {{such as this one}} in the Farnese. Wittkower was surprised that a Farnese cardinal surrounded himself with frescoes of libidinous themes, indicative of a [...] "considerable relaxation of counter-reformatory morality". This thematic choice suggests Carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of Caravaggio's canvases. Wittkower states Carracci's [...] "frescoes convey the impression of a tremendous joie de vivre, a new blossoming of vitality and of an energy long repressed".|$|E

Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along." [...] Vanzetti developed his command of English {{to such a degree that}} journalist Murray Kempton later described him as [...] "the greatest writer of English in <b>our</b> <b>century</b> to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ivan Turgenev {{gradually}} re-considered {{his initial}} skepticism {{as to the}} novel’s historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written {{in the form of}} a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper , Turgenev described Tolstoy as [...] "the most popular Russian writer" [...] and War and Peace as [...] "one of the most remarkable books of our age". [...] "This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of <b>our</b> <b>century</b> in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there’s true, real Russia", Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.|$|E

60|$|In {{an age of}} hurry {{like ours}} the {{appearance}} of an epic poem more than five thousand lines in length cannot but be regarded as remarkable. Whether such a form of art is the one most suited to <b>our</b> <b>century</b> is a question. Edgar Allan Poe insisted that no poem should take {{more than an hour}} to read, the essence of a work of art being its unity of impression and of effect. Still, {{it would be difficult to}} accept absolutely a canon of art which would place the Divine Comedy on the shelf and deprive us of the Bothwell of Mr. Swinburne. A work of art is to be estimated by its beauty not by its size, and in Mr. Wills's Melchior there is beauty of a rich and lofty character.|$|E
