40|$|The {{case for}} taxing {{financial}} transactions merely {{to raise more}} revenues from the financial sector is not particularly strong. Better alternatives to tax the financial sector {{are likely to be}} available. However, a tax on financial transactions could be justified in order to limit socially undesirable transactions when more direct means of doing so are unavailable for political or practical reasons. Some financial transactions are indeed likely to do more harm than good, especially when they contribute to the systemic risk of the financial system. However, such a financial transaction tax should be very small, much smaller than the negative externalities in question, because it is a blunt instrument that also drives out socially useful transactions. There is a case for taxing <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>derivative</b> transactions at a somewhat higher rate than exchange-based derivative transactions. More targeted remedies to drive out socially undesirable transactions should be sought in parallel, which would allow, after their implementation, to reduce or even phase out financial transaction taxes. transaction tax, Tobin tax, financial transactions, global financial crisis, financial regulation...|$|E
40|$|Banks use <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>derivative</b> (OTCD) {{contracts}} for sharing {{the risks of}} their asset streams. OTCDs are composed of an optimal combination of interbank loans, asset swaps and credit default swaps (CDS). The settlement of ex-post realized claims are renegotiated by participating banks after defaults {{by one or more}} banks to minimize the systemic impact of the default. The bailout by a solvent bank of an insolvent one creates a positive externality for all other solvent banks in the system with claims due from the insolvent bank. The lack of coordination among the solvent banks leads to an inefficient liquidation policy (system-wide runs) even though we allow mergers among them to potentially internalize the positive externality. Interbanks loans and CDS contracts have relatively lower incentive costs than swaps, but the former has the largest distress costs without renegotiations. With renegotiations, the payoffs of interbank loans and CDS are similar in strong bankruptcy regimes, while the latter dominate in weak regimes. Asset swaps provide the best hedging and are optimal for banks without incentive problems. Hedging with optimal OTCD contracts creates a tradeoff between the amount of credit risk and systemic risk (liquidation spillover) in the banking system...|$|E

40|$|The credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) on an <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>derivative</b> transaction is {{the price}} of the risk associated with the potential default of the counterparties to the trade. This dissertation provides an introduction to the concept of CVA, beginning with the required backdrop of counterparty risk and the basics of default risk modelling. Right and wrong way risks are central themes of the dissertation. A model for the pricing of both the unilateral and the bilateral CVA on a credit default swap (CDS) is implemented. Each step of this process is explained thoroughly. Results are reported and discussed for a range of parameters. The trends observed in the CDS CVA numbers produced by the model are all justified and the right and wrong way nature of the exposures captured. In addition, the convergence and stability of the numerical schemes utilised are shown to be appropriate. A case study, in which the model is applied to a set of market scenarios, concludes the dissertation. Since the field is far from established, a number of areas are suggested for further research.

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} {{the background of the}} recent global financial crisis and the concept of one of the financial derivatives such as the credit default swap(CDS) or synthetic CDO(collateral debt obligations), given the rapid growing and changing the <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>derivative</b> markets in their volume and structures. In comparison with the previous literature such as the study of Park & Kim (2011), this research empirically performed more thorough and comprehensive investigations to find any financial characteristics or attributes to determine the CDS spreads. Regarding the results obtained from the multiple regression models, the explanatory variables such as STYIELD 3, SLOPE, INASSETS, and VOLATILITY, showed their statistically significant effects on all the tested dependent variables(DVs). Another procedure such as the principle component analysis(PCA), was also performed to account for additional IDVs as possible determinants of the dependent variables. Subsequent to this analysis, larger coefficients of each corresponding eigenvector such as BETA, PFT 2, GROWTH, STD, and BLEVERAGE were found to be possible financial determinants. For robustness, all the IDVs were employed to be tested in the 'full ' regression model with stepwise procedure. As a result, STYIELD 3, SLOPE, and VOLATILITY, and BETA showed their statistically significant relationship with all th...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{collection}} of four papers, which study a range of topics related to money and finance and use different modeling techniques. The topics, nonetheless, are closely related to a main financial friction: default. The essay on default and monetary policy establishes "collateral default" as an additional monetary transmission mechanism. It studies the interactions between monetary policy, collateral prices and default decision. It shows hat default leads to suboptimal out come by causing inefficient allocations of capital goods. The essay on default and borrowing constraint studies the optimal Loan- to-Value ratio. It shows that the welfare of constrained borrower is not monotonically increasing in the LTV ratios. Moreover, there exist an over borrowing issue which necessitates government regulation on the amount of borrowing. The essay on default and banking regulation provides a DSGE model to study the impacts of Basel capital requirements on the real economy. It predicts banks' choice for the different regimes under the Basel framework. Finally, the essay on default and financial infrastructure studies the capital requirements on the <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>derivative</b> central counterparties (CCPs). It finds that the capital buffers of CCPs are highly sensitive to alternative model assumptions and inputs. Thus, it calls for detailed and prescriptive regulatory standards to avoid regulatory arbitrage land to sustain financial stability. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
