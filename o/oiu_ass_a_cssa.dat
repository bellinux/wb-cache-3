We present algorithms for finding a minimum width color-spanning axis parallel square annulus (CSSA), minimum width color spanning axis parallel rectangular annulus (CSRA), and minimum width color-spanning equilateral triangular annulus of fixed orientation (CSETA). The time complexities of computing (i) <b>a</b> <b>CSSA</b> is O(n^ 3 +n^ 2 k k) which is an improvement by a factor n over the existing result on this problem, (ii) that for a CSRA is O(n^ 4 n), and for (iii) a CSETA is O(n^ 3 k). The space complexity of all the algorithms is O(k). Comment: 14 page...|$|R
