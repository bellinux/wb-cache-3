5|$|Ahead of the 2003 {{municipal}} elections, the Labour Party mayor {{candidates for}} the municipalities of Skedsmo, Rælingen and Lørenskog, Andreas Hamnes, Terje Granerud and Åge Tovan, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for Nedre Romerike. The proposal was followed up by the three athletics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Strømmen IF and Lørenskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestrøm idrettspark because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of existing utilities, parking and changing rooms, which would reduce the investment costs. In the process, Strømmen stadion was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive artificial turf and Marikollen was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in Lørenskog was deemed unsuitable. The choice of Lillestrøm idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.|$|E
5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of inputs, such as {{physical}} capital or labour, or from technological progress in {{knowledge of how to}} transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{trends in the}} residual Sq amplitude at 40 investigated stations on <b>the</b> data <b>availability</b> period, we analyzed <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trends in the residual Sq amplitude as functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>availability</b> period and <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. These results are shown in Figure  7.

In Figure  7, the trends in the residual Sq amplitude were largely scattered without dependence on <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>availability</b> period at each station. These results indicate that <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>availability</b> period at <b>the</b> different stations did not influence the long-term trends in the residual Sq amplitude.|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the first}} season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010, and the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black) and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell. The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of studio space.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>availability</b> required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{obligations}} that telecommunications providers have with their customers are nowadays clearly specified in SLA contracts. <b>The</b> offered <b>availability</b> during <b>the</b> contract period is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most relevant variables in SLAs. Modeling accurately the transient solution posed by <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> considering <b>the</b> interval <b>availability</b> {{is still an}} open challenge. A common policy taken to make simpler models is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> steady state assumptions. Nevertheless, this simplification may put on risk the contract fulfillment as stochastic variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measured <b>availability</b> are significant over a typical contract period. This paper makes a theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval <b>availability</b> and propose an approximation to evaluate the cumulative downtime distribution of a system component using renewal theory. We study <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval <b>availability</b> with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation period i. e., duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, and show its respective impact in the SLA success probability. In addition, using the approximation proposed, we analyze numerically <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cumulative downtime distribution and the SLA risk under processes that do not follow Markovian assumptions. ...|$|R
