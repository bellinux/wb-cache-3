First of all, we have developed the list of viewpoints for university students to check the environment <b>of</b> <b>lecture</b> rooms. The list consists of 107 items that were picked out through the free-answer method. Next, using these effects, we have examined the differences of the environment factors by means of cluster analysis. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) The environment factors <b>of</b> <b>lecture</b> rooms presented by university students have been devided into 7 categories. Those are "equipment", "school furniture", "color", "disaster", "cleanness & silence", "space" and "air". 2) By means of cluster analysis, 6 types of viewpoints to cognize the environment <b>of</b> <b>lecture</b> rooms have been clarified...|$|R
5|$|His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, {{died from}} lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a {{four-year}} struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> overseas {{to spend more}} time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series <b>of</b> <b>lectures.</b> In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Gillespie {{and others}} founded a {{registered}} charity {{which was to}} become the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The Society's first president was lawyer and politician Edward Theodore Salvesen, son of the Norwegian merchant Christian Salveson—a connection which would prove significant in later years. A series <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> given to the society by J. Arthur Thomson gave yet more momentum to the modern approach being spearheaded by Hagenbeck in Germany.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA lecture {{should contain}} various forms <b>of</b> <b>lecture</b> {{language}} {{that could help}} students understand the flow <b>of</b> the <b>lecture.</b> <b>Lecture</b> language consists <b>of</b> expressions that mark the topic and plan <b>of</b> a <b>lecture,</b> and/or expressions that signal a new or transition of ideas. Currently, a spoken academic corpus <b>of</b> Malaysian engineering <b>lectures</b> (MASE corpus) is being developed in a joint project between Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Coventry University.

5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries.

He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based on a series <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that {{the primary cause of}} economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, a series <b>of</b> <b>lectures</b> {{he gave to}} the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809.

In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course <b>of</b> <b>Lectures</b> on Mineralogy.

40|$|In {{discussing}} about lecturing (teaching and learning) at thehigher education, we {{are usually}} too much concerned with theapproaches, methods, media <b>of</b> <b>lecturing,</b> but do seldom or even never {{pay attention to}} the objectives <b>of</b> <b>lecturing.</b> We are too much occupied with changing from one method <b>of</b> <b>lecturing</b> to another, for example, from active learning method, contextual method, constructivistic method, student-based curriculum, school-based curriculum, competence-based curriculum, up to curriculum of lesson unit level. Such a complicated thinking is futile unless people are reallyconcerned with directions and objectives <b>of</b> the <b>lecturing</b> activities. In term <b>of</b> <b>lecturing</b> as a way of thinking, the planned activities, we need previously to find out the direction and the goals of the activities, and then we may draw our attention to the methods in order to reach the targeted goals. The targeted goals <b>of</b> <b>lecturing</b> are making students think clearly and distinctly, making students can find the truth of scientific knowledge, making students become problem finders and problem solvers. As academic activities, the lecturing processes should be held scientifically. In addition to obtaining clear scientific stuffs, the lecturing activities should support the students to find the truthof science. After comprehending all types of truth, we may start to find out the description of scientific truth, as the targeted goal to pursue in the scientific activities. Furthermore, we may try to reveal and to find the truth of scientific knowledge in the lecturing activities. Through finding out the description of the truth during the lecturing activities, we expect to have appropriate orientation and steps <b>of</b> implementing the <b>lecturing</b> activities in order to reach the targeted goals <b>of</b> <b>lecturing.</b> By reaching the goals <b>of</b> <b>lecturing,</b> the students are expected to find some benefits from the lecturing activities. Then the activities will not be considered as burden for the students, but rather as the activities resulting in mental richness, generating enlightenment, and increasing students 2 ̆ 7 abilities...|$|R

These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats.

5|$|The college's {{students}} {{became known}} as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were {{unlike the rest of}} the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead <b>of</b> <b>lectures.</b> Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.|$|E
