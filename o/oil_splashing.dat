Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump {{and back to the}} oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.|$|E

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{fluid dynamics}} of the flow around a rotating single gear wheel which is partially submerged in oil within a modelled SAAB gearbox. A literature survey shows a very limited amount of studies on this topic which are publicly available at the moment. The experimental measurements were carried out by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) on this very highly complex flow. For the purpose of experimental study a test rig representing a simplfied model of a gearbox was built. The rig is specially designed for using PIV which means the optical access to the flow is maximized. The flow similarity {{with respect to a}} real gearbox is maintained and the working fluid is a transparent mineral oil. The wheel model is made interchangeable and the wheel rotation speed can be varied to investigate different operation conditions. Two different wheel models with a diameter of 220 mm were considered in the measurement, one of them is smooth and the other one has spur teeth. At a very low rotational speed, (50 rpm), the flow is mostly in one-phase below the oil level. As the rotational speed increases (400 rpm), the flow pattern around the wheel become chaotic and two different two-phase flows with rotation, free-surface effects, and liquid splashing effects are involved. As the wheel rotates and splashing lead to the creation of oil droplets in the top part of the box and air bubbles are generated in the bottom part within the oil. At this stage the optical access become limited by partly from bubbles and <b>oil</b> <b>splashing</b> on the window. These bubbles cause problems due to optical refraction and distortion when laser light is illuminated on them. This issue was partly resolved by performing the experimental measurement in a "transient" mode. The transient mode was applied {{in such a way that}} a trigger signal was provided from the wheel to the PIV processor in order to allow immediate measurements suddenly after the rotation was started...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. Engine sump oil temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump oil temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump oil temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash,</b> its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump oil temperature and engine load as well as sump oil temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R

The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase.

50|$|Smaller {{compressors}} {{are often}} splash lubricated - the <b>oil</b> is <b>splashed</b> {{around in the}} crankcase by {{the impact of the}} crankshaft and connecting rods - but larger compressors are likely to have pressurized lubrication using an oil pump which supplies the oil to critical areas through pipes and passages in the castings. Most oil lubricated compressors will have a wet sump {{at the bottom of the}} crankcase, and require the oil level to be within limits indicated by a sight glass or dipstick for proper lubrication. The compressor should also be level within the manufacturer's specification while operating. These constraints ensure that the lubricant is in the right place for either the moving parts to contact it for splash lubrication, or for reliable suction to the oil pump. Failure to comply with these specifications can lead to damage to the compressor due to excessive friction and overheating, and contamination of the breathing air by toxic breakdown products of the lubricants.|$|R

Some semi-empirical computational models are introduced to calculate the number and diameters of the secondary droplets. Then, the performance of a typical air/oil separator is predicted, including the separation efficiency and the minimum diameter. Results show that about the efficiency may reduce 1 ~ 2 % due to the splash phenomena. While, no obvious difference is observed...|$|R

Decorative engravings made by this method may go through a second process to produce a decorative background. The raised parts and their shoulders are painted with an etchant-resistant material and a pattern of etchant-resistant material is applied to the deep parts of the engraving. The resist for the background may be another photoengraving or may be randomly splashed on. The engraving is etched again for a short time to produce a raised pattern in the background. Decorative engravings of this type may also be spray-painted and sanded as in the previous method.|$|R
40|$|An {{engineering}} {{model of a}} generic synchronizer is considered. The generic synchronizer is modeled consisting of the selector sleeve with engaging teeth and frictional cone, the synchronizing ring with blocker and the gearwheel with engaging teeth. It is assumed that for the sleeve and synchronizing ring translational and rotational motions are feasible, for the gearwheel only rotational motion is feasible. The motion of the generic synchronizer is performed under the external and internal loads. The external loads comprise the vehicle resistance torque and the control force applied to the sleeve and the drag torque due to the clutch. The internal loads comprise the forces and torques arises due to interaction between the sleeve, the synchronizing ring, the gearwheel as well as <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> during the synchronization process. A feasible synchronization process of a generic synchronizer is divided into four main phases: pre-synchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition (indexing for the ring), and engagement. Pre-synchronization and blocker transition are further divided into several sub-phases. The generic synchronizer is fully parametrized and together with description of all phases constitutes kinematics of synchronization process in question. Due {{to the nature of}} synchronization process in transmission system a motion of a synchronizer mechanism is subjected to unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates or/and generalized velocities of the synchronizer. Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) has been proposed as an approach for developing mathematical and computational models of a generic synchronizer dynamics. The CLF gives possibility to formulate direct dynamics, semi-inverse dynamics and inverse dynamics problems for a generic synchronizer in unified and efficient way. It is shown that CLF can be promising and useful for advanced dynamic analysis of the existing synchronizer mechanisms and to design novel optimized ones. In the present report mathematical and computational models of a generic synchronizer with five degrees of freedom have been developed using CLF. Application of CLF on the modelling of the synchronization process gives system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). Analysis of the generic synchronizer performance diagrams has shown that the CLF based model is able to predict the synchronization process characteristics reasonably well. The developed model has been validated by using measurement data from test rig at CV AB Scania. Performance of the generic synchronizer is also analyzed in case of driveline vibrations. Sensitivity analysis of the synchronizer mechanism performance with respect to cone angle, coefficient of friction, maximum value of shift force and rate of applying shift force has been done. Next, the developed models will be used to get further insight into synchronizer design and its performance diagrams with aid of global sensitivity analysis and Pareto optimization...|$|R

Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines {{in parts of the}} engine where directly <b>splashed</b> <b>oil</b> cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} thermodynamic and fluid mechanic analysis of an engine lubrication system. A comprehensive thermofluid computer model {{was developed to}} provide a flexible design analysis tool for the accurate prediction of oil pressures, flow rates and temperatures at any point within any lubrication system. Technical and financial support for the study was provided by Jaguar Cars. A comprehensive literature review revealed that the past {{research in this field}} had concentrated on either the thermofluid analysis of the lubrication system by engine testing, or the detailed analysis of individual components. A small number of computer models were developed for the flow analysis of the whole lubrication system. However, these models had limited heat transfer prediction capabilities, some requiring measured engine temperature data, and were not flexible enough to be employed as design tools. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a flexible steady-state thermofluid design analysis tool, by integrating a flow analysis approach with a detailed analysis of the heat transfer within the engine block. Mathematical models of the thermofluid behaviour of the lubrication system components were developed and were implemented in a suite of FORTRAN computer programs which formed the design analysis package. A simple, linear flow model was initially developed to represent the system with a combination of laminar pipes, pumps, filters, journal bearings, crank-shaft transfer holes and cam bearing transfer holes. The linear program provided a rapid analysis tool, but the accuracy of the results were limited by the simplified flow characteristics of the system components. A more comprehensive and flexible non-linear flow model was developed, which solved for the unknowns with an iterative technique. Additional component models with non-linear flow characteristics, such as turbulent pipes, annular pipes, strainers, and oil coolers, were developed. The non-linear solution technique was proven to be robust and flexible and was subsequently used in all the analysis programs. The heat transfer to the oil within the pressurised part of the lubrication system is modelled by the heat transfer program. The engine block temperatures are calculated by the engine block program. This program accounts for the heat transfer to the <b>oil</b> <b>splashed</b> on to the internal surfaces of the engine. The engine geometry is represented by a series of block elements and modelled as a nodal resistance network. This capability has particular importance during the design stage, rapidly providing an estimate of the temperature profile through the engine block, results which were previously only available from expensive and slow FEA models. It was shown that both the Jaguar AJ 6 and V 8 engine lubrication systems could be analyzed in great detail. Engine tests showed that the predicted flow rates, pressures and temperatures were in excellent agreement with measured values. The overall accuracy of the results induced a high degree of confidence in the thermofluid model. The final analysis package was proven to be easy to use, robust, rapid, flexible and accurate. The design analysis package, developed during the course of this study, represents a unique stand-alone simulation tool which can rapidly analyze any engine lubrication system configuration. This package provides a valuable analysis tool which can be used to optimise system designs at the initial design stage and the diagnosis of performance problems during the development phase. Parametric studies can be easily carried out on the lubrication system and engine block configuration to identify areas which can enhance heat transfer to the oil. The steady-state analysis package forms an excellent platform for the development of a full transient model. This would allow a detailed analysis of the lubrication system during engine warm-up, with the aim of reducing engine emissions and determining minimum oil requirements...|$|R
