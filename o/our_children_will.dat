Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] " [...] outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.

[...] As more details of the shooting emerged, the Christian Science Monitor reported: [...] "The suggestion that the shooting of Rep.

The other believes that the federal government, using taxpayers’ money, should {{play a major role}} in leveling out the nation’s wealth to guarantee outcomes to all, regardless of effort.

60|$|It is {{in quite}} other {{directions}} that the scientific achievements to astonish <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> probably be achieved. Progress never {{appears to be}} uniform in human affairs. There are intricate correlations between department and department. One field must mark time until another can come up to it with results sufficiently arranged and conclusions sufficiently simplified for application Medicine waits on organic chemistry, geology on mineralogy, and both on the chemistry of high pressures and temperature. And subtle variations in method and the prevailing mental temperament {{of the type of}} writer engaged, produce remarkable differences in {{the quality and quantity of}} the stated result. Moreover, there are in the history of every scientific province periods of seed-time, when there is great activity without immediate apparent fruition, and periods, as, for example, the last two decades of electrical application, of prolific realisation. It is highly probable that the physiologist and the organic chemist are working towards co-operations that may make the physician's sphere the new scientific wonderland.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the many}} wild absurdities of our {{existing}} social order {{perhaps the most}} grotesque is the costly and strictly enforced reservation of large tracts of country as deer forests and breeding grounds for pheasants whilst {{there is so little}} provision of the kind made for children. I have more than once thought of trying to introduce the shooting of children as a sport, as the children would then be preserved very carefully for ten months in the year, thereby reducing their death rate far more than the fusillades of the sportsmen during the other two would raise it. At present the killing of a fox except by a pack of foxhounds is regarded with horror; but you may and do kill children in a hundred and fifty ways provided you do not shoot them or set a pack of dogs on them. It must be admitted that the foxes have the best of it; and indeed a glance at our pheasants, our deer, and <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> convince the most sceptical that the children have decidedly the worst of it.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it must be}} {{steadily}} remembered {{that there are many}} naturalists at the present day, especially among those of the lower order of intelligence, who, while accepting evolutionism in a general way, and therefore always describing themselves as Darwinians, do not believe and often cannot even understand the distinctive Darwinian addition to the evolutionary doctrine--namely, the principle of natural selection. Such hazy and indistinct thinkers as these are still really at the prior stage of Lamarckian evolutionism. It is probable that in the future, while a formal acceptance of Darwinism becomes general, the special theory of natural selection will be thoroughly understood and assimilated only by the more abstract and philosophical minds. <b>Our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be taught {{as a matter of course}} the doctrine of development or of descent with modification; but the rationale of that descent will still remain in all likelihood always beyond the grasp of most of them: just as thousands accept on authority the Copernican astronomy, who would never even be capable of comprehending the simplest proofs of the earth's annual movement round the sun. Thus the name of Darwin will often no doubt be tacked on to what are in reality the principles of Lamarck.|$|E

The old earnest hearts go home one by one to their rest; and the young earnest hearts--and who shall blame them?--go elsewhere; and try new fashions of doing good, which are more graceful and more {{agreeable}} to them. For the religious world, like all other forms of the world, has its fashions; and of them too stands true the saying of the apostle: That this world and the fashion thereof pass away.

60|$|I {{know it is}} {{all very}} strange. From the height of eight hundred years ago, or of eight hundred years hence, our age must look {{incredibly}} odd. We call the twelfth century ascetic. We call our own time hedonist and full of praise and pleasure. But in the ascetic age the love of life was evident and enormous, so {{that it had to}} be restrained. In an hedonist age pleasure has always sunk low, so that it has to be encouraged. How high the sea of human happiness rose in the Middle Ages, we now only know by the colossal walls that they built to keep it in bounds. How low human happiness sank in the twentieth century <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> only know by these extraordinary modern books, which tell people that it is a duty to be cheerful and that life is not so bad after all. Humanity never produces optimists till it has ceased to produce happy men. It is strange to be obliged to impose a holiday like a fast, and to drive men to a banquet with spears. But this shall be written of our time: that when the spirit who denies besieged the last citadel, blaspheming life itself, there were some, there was one especially, whose voice was heard and whose spear was never broken.|$|E

The fortifications, so numerous in all this region, and now so unsightly with their bare, precipitous sides, will remain as historic monuments, grass-grown and picturesque memorials of an epoch of terror and suffering: they will serve to make our country dearer and more interesting to us, and afford fit soil for poetry to root itself in: for this is a plant which thrives best in spots where blood has been spilt long ago, and grows in abundant clusters in old ditches, such as the moat around Fort Ellsworth will be a century hence. It may seem to be paying dear for what many will reckon but a worthless weed; but the more historical associations we can link with our localities, the richer will be the daily life that feeds upon the past, and the more valuable the things that have been long established: so that <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be less prodigal than their fathers in sacrificing good institutions to passionate impulses and impracticable theories.
