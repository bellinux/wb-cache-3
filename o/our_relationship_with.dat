25|$|Shafarevich {{argued that}} ancient {{socialism}} (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was {{a reaction to}} the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E

500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a place you never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> God, we're going down. There's too much going against us.

According to military sources, the army chief was expected to meet the Chinese president and prime minister alongside top security officials, and a focal agenda of the meeting included discussions on the NATO incident, a briefing by Kayani on rewriting terms of engagement with the US, as well as security co-operation between China and Pakistan. Commenting on the occasion, a security official said: [...] "We want to take <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> China to the next level".|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini {{remarked to}} the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the {{completed}} album. [...] Albini commented {{years later that}} in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation [...] "from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. [...] All I know is... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. [...] A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone". [...] While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. [...] Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author [...] "ridiculed <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> our label based on totally erronous [...] information"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. [...] Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek {{to complain about the}} article.|$|E

[...] The interviews showed that computers are both a part of our selves as well as part of the external world.

500|$|Catholic {{theology}} sees conscience as {{the last}} practical [...] "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [...] to do good and to avoid evil". The Second Vatican Council (1962-65) describes: [...] "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and {{to do what is}} good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths." [...] Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but [...] "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful" [...] In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. [...] Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, [...] "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. [...] A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, [...] "t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits." [...] Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. [...] For example, some priests make {{on the use of the}} so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that [...] "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct".|$|E
