5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

25|$|Habeas corpus {{has certain}} limitations. Though a writ of right, {{it is not}} a writ <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>It</b> is {{technically}} only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or state of emergency.|$|E

For example, one might use respectively 0, 1, 2, and 3 volts to code a four-symbol alphabet on a wire, or holes of different sizes in a punched card. In practice, the tight constraints of high speed, small size, and low power combine to make noise a major factor. This {{makes it hard to}} distinguish between symbols when there are several possible symbols that could occur at a single site. Rather than attempting to distinguish between four voltages on one wire, digital designers have settled on two voltages per wire, high and low.|$|E
25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

On the whole I think our team played very well but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it.

500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E

500|$|Grossmith also wrote, composed, and {{performed}} in several one-man drawing room sketches, short comic operas or monologues that were {{given at the}} Opera Comique or the Savoy Theatre {{in place of the}} companion pieces when shorter matinee programmes were playing. These works included Beauties on the Beach (1878), Five Hamlets (1878), a revival of his A Silver Wedding (1879), The Drama on Crutches (1883), Homburg, or Haunted by The Mikado (1887–88), and Holiday Hall (1888). In reviewing a matinee performance of The Drama on Crutches, The Times commented, [...] "he not only satirizes the present tendency of fashionable amateurs to join the stage, but also parodies ... the manner of Mr. Irving and other actors of the present day, including himself. [...] The sketch created great amusement, though <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> depends entirely for its success upon the actor's powers of mimicry." [...] Grossmith also performed in charity events, including as Bouncer in Cox and Box in 1879 at the Opera Comique.|$|E

McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race: [...] "The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on us {{and we were able to}} trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage." [...] Villeneuve was happy with his strong finish and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who made contact with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision.

Ian Inglis writes that [...] "Its rolling melody and warm vocals give it the texture of a love song, which, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> is: a love song to the Beatles." [...] In his book subtitled The Essential Songs of the Beatles' Solo Careers, Andrew Grant Jackson concludes of [...] "Run of the Mill": [...] "Such personal musings would be irrelevant to anyone but the biggest Beatle fans if Harrison hadn't so artfully written the words to be open-ended and applicable to anyone … A touching work of maturity by a little brother who saw more clearly than the others, realizing that he loved them but {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E
