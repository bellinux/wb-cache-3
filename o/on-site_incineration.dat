Between 1991 and 1993, a groundwater extraction system was constructed onsite, which created a hydraulic barrier around the site, so that no off-site migration would occur. The original ROD also called for <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration</b> of soils and sludge materials. However, the ROD was amended in 1994 to the following: ...|$|E

Site remediation was originally to be done through an on-site incinerator, but after {{a significant portion of}} the incinerator apparatus was built, the plan was scrapped due to community opposition and because many of the pollutants were nonburnable minerals. The South Belt-Ellington Leader, a community newspaper still in publication as of January 2017, was known for publishing details of the Brio Superfund site and being a key opponent to <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration.</b>|$|E
40|$|Waste biosludge {{generated}} in Shell's Deer Park Manufacturing Complex aqueous effluent treatment facilities is disposed of by <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration.</b> In 1981, an energy conservation program {{resulted in a}} 48 percent reduction in natural gas consumption equalling 440 MSCF per day. The most significant reduction in natural gas consumption was realized by modifying the incinerator operating procedures. Further reductions were obtained by minor process control revisions and equipment modifications. It was also found that additional natural gas could be conserved by blocked out incinerator runs in which the incinerator was shut down and biosludge accumulated until inventories permitted operation of the incinerator nearer to design rate. This paper describes the operational and process control revisions that were made and the relative impact of these changes on natural gas consumption. Blocked out operation of the incinerator is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{vertical}} spinning {{fluidised bed}} (SFB) have several drawbacks, such as non-uniform radial and axial bed fluidisation, feeding and ash accumulation problems. The {{purpose of this}} research, therefore {{is to develop a}} prototype of the horizontal SFB combustor capable of overcoming these drawbacks. The scopes of the research include engineering design of the prototype, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and set-up/commissioning of the developed prototype. Under this research, a prototype of the horizontal SFB has been successfully developed and is able to overcome the inherent weakness in vertical SFB. The innovative secondary chamber provides more freeboard for more complete combustion and acts as particulate control device. The prototype is suitable for burning low-density materials (rice husk, fibrous materials), which are difficult to be burnt in conventional fluidised bed by imparting a higher centrifugal force. There is also no limit to the amount of air throughput and combustion is only limited by the kinetics in which each different type of waste burns. Results from the CFD modelling narrowed down the parameters to be tested on the SFB in future experimental works, as well as providing design improvements on the current SFB design. Due to its compactness and versatility in burning a wide range of waste, the SFB prototype {{has the potential to be}} utilised as small-scale <b>on-site</b> waste <b>incineration</b> facility and high-efficiency gas burner for high-loading waste gas streams in chemical plants or refineries. The whole system is mountable to a truck and can be transported to waste sources such as rice mills, sawmills, wastewater treatment plants to incinerate waste. The full performance on the developed SFB during combustion of various types of wastes is outside the scope of the current research and therefore, is subjected to future experimental works...|$|R
30|$|In Pakistan, {{there are}} several poultry farms that produce {{a large amount of}} poultry waste daily and all poultry farms’ owners are facing {{problems}} due to lack of storage, disposal and handling facilities. Problems related to regulatory pressure, urban invasion, fly control, and proximate land base for waste disposal compel the search for an alternative waste management system (Yadav et al. 2017). The commonly used livestock solid waste disposal techniques include <b>on-site</b> burial, landfill, <b>incineration</b> and composting. However, its direct use for plantations, pastures and open field’s area reduced the variety, quality and can disrupt the biological structure of the soil. Poultry waste is a mixture of poultry feces, bedding material, waste feed and feathers that have an important financial and viable potential for composting. The selection of the composting process depends upon the climate condition, nature of waste, type of animal waste, economic conditions and its application. The aerobic and anaerobic composting process are commonly used for poultry waste decomposition and are better compared to burning and other different drying techniques (Chen and Jiang 2014). The microbiological, chemical processed and recycled chicken feces waste are significantly used as organic fertilizer and widely spread on productive land. Poultry waste contains different concentrations of water and nutrients for plants’ growth like calcium, boron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, manganese, copper, nitrogen, sulfur, zinc, iron, molybdenum and organic matter. It is easily available at low cost from vicinity farms to restore and improve the chemical, physical and biological fertility of the degraded soil (Liang et al. 2017; Yee 2017).|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is a {{viral disease}} {{that caused the}} largest animal disease outbreak in the history of US agriculture. There are several disposal methods of AI infected poultry carcasses available in the US, which include <b>on-site</b> burial, landfill, <b>incineration,</b> rendering, and composting. Of these methods, composting is the most environmentally friendly and poses a low risk for biosecurity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed a comprehensive plan for composting AI infected carcasses. The current protocols have the potential for areas of anaerobic pockets within the windrow due to inadequate mixing and the large carcass size of whole birds. This could lead to ineffective virus neutralization or prolonged composting times and higher resource costs. The purpose of this project was to determine if using a horizontal mixer (HM) wagon to mix composting ingredients or a vertical mixer (VM) wagon to mix and cut up the compositing ingredients is an economical and timely means to accelerate the tissue break-down and obtain optimal temperatures for poultry carcass composting during an AI outbreak. Materials and Methods: A replicated trial with three treatments, HM, conventional layering (CL) and VM, and three replications was initiated at the Compost Research and Education Center part of the University of Maine Forest and Agricultural Experimental Station called High Moor Farm. Daily temperatures and screened core sample weights (screen weights) on day 0, 16, and 30 were recorded for each of the compost piles. The time to build each replication was recorded and used to help calculate the cost of each method. Data on equipment, carbon material and labor costs were collected from private contractors from the 2014 to 2016 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) outbreak and used to compare costs between methods. Results: All treatment methods reached USDA protocol temperatures to neutralize the HPAI virus. Screen weights for both the VM and HM treatments were lower than the CL treatment. Screen weights decreased significantly from day 0 to day 16 for the VM and HM treatments with no significant change from day 16 to day 30. When comparing costs, the mixer wagon methods were the more cost effective than the CL method when using high volume equipment. Conclusion: The data from this study support the use of a mixer wagon to reduce particle size and mix ingredients for more timely and effective composting of poultry carcasses...|$|R
40|$|Thousands {{of tons of}} {{chemical}} weapons are currently being stored in eight locations across the United States. Both a congressional act and an international treaty require the U. S. Army to destroy these chemical weapon stockpiles. The Army plans to use <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration</b> to destroy the weapons stored at four of these sites, and it has recently decided to use non-incineration processes to destroy the chemical agents stored at the other four sites. Two recent cases have been filed challenging the Army’s decision to continue pursuing incineration at half of the sites, alleging that the Army has violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to complete a supplemental environmental impact statement for the incineration program. This Note discusses why a court considering these issues should find that the Army has violated NEPA, and it also considers whether NEPA will be successful in stopping the Army’s use of incineration...|$|E

40|$|Eleven {{million tonnes}} of waste are {{produced}} yearly by the European {{pulp and paper}} industry, of which 70 % originates from the production of deinked recycled paper. Wastes are very diverse in composition and consist of rejects, different types of sludges and ashes in mills having <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration</b> treatment. The production of pulp and paper from virgin pulp generates less waste but the waste has similar properties to waste from the production of deinked pulp, although with less inorganics. Due to legislation and increased taxes, landfills are quickly being eliminated as a final destination for wastes in Europe, and incineration with energy recovery is becoming the main waste recovery method. Other options such as pyrolysis, gasification, land spreading, composting and reuse as building material are being applied, although research is still needed for optimization of the processes. Due to the large volumes of waste generated, the high moisture content of the waste and the changing waste composition {{as a result of}} process conditions, recovery methods are usually expensive and their environmental impact is still uncertain. For this reason, it is necessary to continue research on different applications of wastes, while taking into account the environmental and economical factors of these waste treatments...|$|E
40|$|An analyses, of six (6) soil {{remediation}} alternatives {{was completed in}} attempt to establish an effective hydrocarbon-contaminated soils remediation program at the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Program (YMP). The remediation alternatives analyzed included: no remediation, <b>on-site</b> <b>incineration,</b> off-site incineration, in-situ. bioremediation, ex-situ bioremediation, and excavation and disposal. Variables considered in the evaluation process included cost of contaminated soil transportation, treatment costs, future liability, and success of remediating the contaminated soils to below regulatory thresholds. The analysis concluded in the recommendation of an on-site ex-situ bioremediation treatment facility (BTF) to remediate hydrocarbon-contaminated soils at the YMP. The selection {{was based on the}} low treatment costs provided by the technology, the ability to treat the contaminated soils on-site, and the success of the technology to treat contaminated soils to below regulatory thresholds. The BTF will be established to treat YMP hydrocarbon-contaminated soils that originated from operational, historical, and abandoned hydrocarbon releases. Prior to submission for treatment, the contaminated soils must be qualified either through process knowledge or analytical sampling. Through this qualification process, hazardous wastes will entirely be excluded from the contaminated soils wastestream. In addition, the BTF will initially be operated in test mode in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the treatment technology and to develop a baseline remediation schedule. To that end, the BTF is expected to be expanded as site characterization continues at the YMP and ultimately fuction as an effective hydrocarbon contaminated soils remediation program...|$|E
