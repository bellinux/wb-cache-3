The security of the minority government came under fire as the Conservatives threatened to force an election by use of their [...] "opposition day," [...] when they get to set the Parliament's agenda. The Conservatives would use this time to hold a vote of no confidence in order to topple Martin's government. To avoid this, Martin removed all <b>opposition</b> <b>days</b> from the schedule and made a televised appearance on April 21, 2005, to attempt to gain support from the Canadian people to let the inquiry run its course before an election is called. In the rebuttal speeches by the opposition party leaders, Layton offered his party's support provided that they were given major concessions in the budget such as canceling the proposed corporate tax cuts. Days later, the Liberals took the NDP up on their offer and negotiated tax cut deferments and new spending initiatives. Among the new commitments was aid for Sudan, which Sudan's officials turned down as Martin did not consult them about it beforehand. This aid was attacked as a perceived attempt to win the vote of a single independent MP, former Liberal David Kilgour. Kilgour nevertheless would vote against the government.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>opposition</b> <b>days</b> were {{associated}} with debates over supply and held prior to the estimates and the budget and were created so that opposition parties could advance ideas for what should {{and should not be}} funded.

5000|$|An {{opposition}} {{day is a}} day in a legislature {{using the}} Westminster System in which an opposition party sets the agenda. Most days the parliamentary agenda is set by the government; <b>opposition</b> <b>days</b> allow the smaller parties to choose the subject for debate. The number of days varies between parliaments. In the United Kingdom there are twenty <b>opposition</b> <b>days</b> per parliamentary session, and in Canada there are twenty-two. The days are divided among opposition parties with the Official Opposition allotted the most; In the UK, the Official Opposition party is given 17 <b>opposition</b> <b>days,</b> and the second biggest opposition party given 3 days. Canadian opposition parties are allocated days, which are also called [...] "allotted" [...] or [...] "supply" [...] days, in proportion to their membership in the House. There are no <b>opposition</b> <b>days</b> in Australian jurisdictions. In India, the Parliament {{does not have an}} opposition day, but every week, one day (every Friday) during a session, is devoted to Private members bills and resolutions.|$|E

In addition to public pressure for the deal to be withdrawn or for the Government to halt the proposal, Britain's major political parties all expressed the view that the deal should not go ahead.

2500|$|In {{opposition}} David Cameron asked Andrew Murrison MP {{to establish}} the Military Covenant Commission. [...] Chaired by the author and ex-RAF pilot Frederick Forsyth CBE and with experts including the Falklands veteran Simon Weston OBE its report heavily influenced the current government's thinking. On 25 June 2010, The Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to enshrine the Military Covenant in law – such a development would allow British servicemen and servicewomen to sue the State for breaches of the Military Covenant. In February 2011 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government decided {{that there was no}} need to make the Covenant law, proposing instead to cover it in an annual report to parliament – a Labour attempt in an <b>opposition</b> <b>day</b> debate to reverse this was defeated by 86 votes.|$|R

50|$|In October 2013, Mathyssen {{introduced}} Bill C-282 {{to eliminate}} the HST on feminine hygiene products. The idea gained popular grassroots support, with a group called Canadian Menstruators organizing an online petition that rapidly attracted {{tens of thousands of}} signatures from across Canada. Mathyssen took the lead in the House of Commons for an NDP <b>Opposition</b> <b>Day,</b> introducing a motion to force a vote on the issue. The governing Conservatives initially tried to stall the effort promising to revisit the idea in the future, without a clear timeline. Mathyssen would not relent however, and with more than 74,000 Canadians having signed the petition, the Conservatives, with pressure mounting from their own female MPs threatening to not show up for the vote, changed course at the last moment. With the backing of MPs from all political parties in the House of Commons, Mathyssen's motion passed and the tax was eliminated July 1, 2015.|$|R

2500|$|The {{government}} then cancelled {{its initial}} <b>opposition</b> <b>day,</b> which was originally {{to be held}} on December 1, to avert the threatened vote of non-confidence, meaning the earliest the coalition could possibly take office would be following a vote on a Liberal motion of non-confidence or on a supply motion put forth by the government, both scheduled for December 8, 2008. On November 30, the Conservatives released a secretly recorded private NDP conference call in which Jack Layton indicated that the groundwork for assuring the Bloc's participation [...] "was done a long time ago." [...] The NDP said in reaction that they would consider pressing criminal charges and alleged that Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) John Duncan received the invitation to participate by mistake, in place of NDP MP Linda Duncan, who had [...] "a similar email address." [...] However, it does not constitute a wiretap crime under the Criminal Code of Canada if someone is {{invited to participate in}} a conference call and then releases the recording publicly.|$|R
