25|$|Three {{denominations}} of 1, 2 and 3-cents {{were printed}} by the offset printing process. There {{are two types}} of the 1-cent denomination, five different types of the 2-cent variety, and two types of the 3-cent variety. These types possess differences in the lines on the toga rope in Washington's profile and usually require the aid of magnification to positively identify their different characteristics. Stamps produced by the <b>offset</b> <b>process</b> were issued with a perforation gauge of 11 with the one exception of the 1919 1-cent issue with gauge 12½. The first Washington-Franklin stamp printed by the <b>offset</b> <b>process</b> was a 3-cent Washington-head, issued on March 22, 1918. The 1-cent green followed and was issued on December 24, 1918. The five types of the 2-cent denomination were issued sometime later on March 15, 1920. Beginning in 1919 an imperforate variety (no perforations between stamps) was also issued. All three denominations were printed and possess the same variations in type that are found on the perforated issues, as the imperforate issues were produced from the same plates. There were no Franklin-heads printed with the Offset printing press.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, several {{ingredients}} of postage stamp ink {{that had previously}} been imported from Germany became unavailable, and the domestic materials that replaced them had significant gritty impurities, with the result that the stamp printing plates became worn much more quickly. In response to this problem, the U.S. Post Office employed the new offset printing process to produce several separate Washington-head issues. The offset method involved taking a photo of a die proof of the postage stamp and through a special process, transferring an image of its negative to a plate of glass, which became the actual printing plate. The set-up and development process was more involved in the preparation stages than the engraving process, but once the photo mask was made it only took about an hour to produce and replace a worn printing plate. The <b>offset</b> <b>process</b> produced an image of lesser quality with a smooth surface, as compared to that of an engraved stamp whose lines are raised above the surface of the paper. A stamp produced by the <b>offset</b> <b>process</b> almost always possesses a softer or grayish tone to its color and is usually easy to distinguish, especially when placed next to a similar stamp printed by the engraving process.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a robust operational planning procedure for a make-to-order environment. The procedure successively {{takes into account}} order deadlines (lead time <b>offsetting</b> <b>process),</b> allows for capacity flexibility and aims at minimizing set-ups. The novelty of the procedure lies {{in the use of}} realistic lead time estimates (including capacity losses) for the lead time <b>offsetting</b> <b>process</b> used to trigger the release of production orders on the shop floor. This way, it overcomes one of the major shortcomings of traditional ERP systems: the shop floor planning becomes more robust (there is less need for changes to the plan) and system performance is improved (total lead times are reduced, while customer service levels increase). The lead time estimates are obtained through rough cut modelling approximations. The performance of the procedure is determined by means of a trace-driven simulation model, based on data from a real-life company. The results indicate that the use of realistic lead time estimates in the planning procedure enhances system performance (in terms of total lead time and customer service level). The results also show valuable insights into the advantages of interchangeable lines, the importance of the planning period, and the dangers of inappropriate batch sizing decisions. The procedure can substantively improve transparency, knowledge and information management for the company and its supply chain partners by integrating it as a fine-tuning tool in an enhanced ERP system.

50|$|So that’s how NURBS {{started at}} Boeing. Boehm’s B-spline {{refinement}} paper from CAD ’80 was of primary importance. It enabled {{the staff to}} understand non-uniform splines and to appreciate the geometrical nature of the definition so as to use B-splines in solving engineering problems. The first use of the geometrical nature of B-splines was in the curve/curve intersection. The Bezier subdivision process was utilized, and a second use was our curve offset algorithm, {{which was based on}} a polygon <b>offset</b> <b>process</b> that was eventually communicated to and used by SDRC and explained by Tiller and Hanson in their offset paper of 1984. The staff also developed an internal NURBS class taught to about 75 Boeing engineers. The class covered Bezier curves, Bezier to B-spline and surfaces. The first public presentation of our NURBS work was at a Seattle CASA/SME seminar in March of 1982. The staff had progressed quite far by then. They could take a rather simple NURBS surface definition of an aircraft and slice it with a plane surface to generate an interesting outline of some of the wing, body and engines. The staff were allowed great freedom in pursuing our ideas and Boeing correctly promoted NURBS, but the task of developing that technology into a useable form was too much for Boeing, which abandoned the TIGER task late in ’84.|$|E

On the other hand, pre-treatment with hydrogen peroxide solution gives better results for ink particle removal from digital offset prints than from conventional offset prints. Optimal parameters for hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment for both offset prints were chosen based on unprinted substrate mass loss results in the preliminary investigation. These results showed that hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment is more successful at removal of impurities in comparison with flotation deinking without pre-treatment...|$|R
