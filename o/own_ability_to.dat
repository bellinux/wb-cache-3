5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Egypt was already well developed before Ibn Tulun's arrival, {{with a number}} of departments (dīwāns) responsible for the collection of the land tax, the supervision of the post, the public granaries (dīwān al-ahrāʿ), the Nile Delta lands (dīwān asfal al-arḍ), and possibly a privy purse (dīwān al-khaṣṣ) for the governor's personal use. A chancery (dīwān al-inshāʾ) possibly also already existed, or else was established under Ibn Tulun, when he remodelled the Egyptian administration after the Abbasid central government. Most of the officials employed by Ibn Tulun were like him trained in the caliphal court at Samarra. Ibn Tulun's chancellor was the capable Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Abd al-Kan (died 891), while other important positions in the administration were held by the four Banu al-Muhajir brothers and Ibn al-Daya. Al-Balawi also reports several anecdotes about Ibn Tulun's extensive use of spies and his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> uncover spies sent against him, and claims that the chancery was established so that Ibn Tulun could check up on every piece of correspondence with the caliphal court.|$|E

25|$|Self-efficacy is an individual's {{impression}} of their <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery.

Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E
25|$|The narrator {{introduces}} a character he once dreamed about, an Abyssinian maid who sings of another land. She is {{a figure of}} imaginary power within the poem who can inspire within the narrator his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> craft poetry. When she sings, {{she is able to}} inspire and mesmerise the poet by describing a false paradise. The woman herself is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time Lewti. The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes it possible that the maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge's 1794 poem The Sigh. Evans, in the poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge's poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson, whom Coleridge wanted but was not his wife and experienced opium induced dreams of being with her.|$|E

40|$|The state {{explosion}} {{problem has}} limited further research of Fuzzy Petri Net (FPN). With the rising scale of FPN, the algorithm complexity for related applications using FPN has also rapidly increased. To overcome this challenge, this research proposed three algorithms, which are transformation algorithm, decomposition algorithm and bidirectional reasoning algorithm {{to solve the}} state explosion problems of knowledge-based system (KBS) modelling and reasoning using FPN. Based on {{the goal of this}} research, the entire research is separated into two tasks, which are KBS modelling and reasoning using FPN. In modelling, a transformation algorithm has been proposed while in reasoning, decomposition and bidirectional reasoning algorithms have been proposed. In transformation, the algorithm is proposed to generate an equivalent large-scale FPN for the corresponding large-size KBS using a novel representation method of Fuzzy Production Rule (FPR). In decomposition, the algorithm is proposed to separate a large-scale FPN into a group of sub-FPNs by using a presented index function and incidence matrix. In bidirectional reasoning, the algorithm for optimal path is proposed to implement inference operations. Experimental results show that all proposed algorithms have successfully accomplished the requirements of each link of KBS modelling and reasoning using large-scale FPN. First, the proposed transformation algorithm <b>owns</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> generate the corresponding FPN for the large-size KBS automatically. Second, the proposed decomposition <b>owns</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> divide a large-scale FPN into a group of sub-FPNs based on the inner-reasoning-path. Lastly, the proposed bidirectional reasoning algorithm <b>owns</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> implement inference for the goal output place in an optimal reasoning path by removal of irrelevant places and transitions.

25|$|An {{important}} quality {{which supports}} right action is Heedfulness (Appamada), {{a combination of}} energy/effort (Viriya) and Mindfulness. Mindfulness is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware {{of what is happening}} with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' (Sampajañña), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is Trust or Confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> put them into practice. Wisdom and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of not-self for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.|$|E

During her sophomore year, while taking {{a course in}} general chemistry, she {{questioned}} her <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> pursue a career in science, and considered switching her major to French. However, her French teacher suggested her to stick with science. Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch, both professors of chemistry at Pomona, had {{a major impact on}} her.

She went to Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989. Her Ph.D. thesis was on engineering a self-replicating catalytic RNA and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak. From 1989 to 1991, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School. From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P.

People with cancer pain who accept that pain will persist and nevertheless are able to engage in a meaningful life were less susceptible to catastrophizing and depression in one study. People with cancer pain who have clear goals, and the motivation and means to achieve those goals, were found in two studies to experience much lower levels of pain, fatigue and depression.|$|E

500|$|Ahimsā (...) in Jainism is a {{fundamental}} principle forming the cornerstone of its ethics and doctrine. The term ahimsa means nonviolence, non-injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms. Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa. The Jain concept of ahimsa {{is very different from}} the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the Jain philosophy, violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self – behaviour which inhibits the soul's <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> attain moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths). [...] At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential. All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as abhayadānam, is the supreme charity that a person can make.|$|E

[...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood.
