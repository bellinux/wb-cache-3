5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and <b>other</b> <b>foods</b> spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and <b>other</b> <b>foods</b> with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with <b>other</b> <b>foods</b> to mask the bitter taste.

5|$|Pottery {{and weaving}} {{are among the}} very first art forms {{showcasing}} Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country.

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is {{strongly}} associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings.

Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and <b>other</b> <b>foods.</b> Table vinegar {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and <b>other</b> <b>foods</b> to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Bean dip {{is a type}} of {{dipping sauce}} made using beans or refried beans as a primary ingredient.

He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc <b>other</b> <b>foods.</b> They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten <b>other</b> <b>foods.</b> The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{examined}} what kind of views and attitudes consumers and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> chain actors have concerning organic food and its production and how these views and attitudes differ. The survey data from year 2003 consist of responses by 1 186 consumers and 333 <b>other</b> <b>food</b> chain actors. The main methods used {{in the analysis of}} survey responses were factor, cluster and discriminant analyses. With the help of these methods, consumers and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> chain actors were clustered into various groups. The discriminant analysis was based on respondents’ attitudes towards organic food and organic food production. As a result of the analysis, five differing attitudinal groups among the consumers were identified. These attitudinal groups were Believers, Committed, Neutrals, Doubters and Negatives. In addition, six differing attitudinal groups were identi-fied among the <b>other</b> <b>food</b> chain actors. These attitu-dinal groups were Believers, Supporters, Weak Doubters, Strong Doubters, Unsatisfieds and Nega-tives. The organic food chain appears to suffer from shortcomings: the products and information do not flow smoothly from producers to consumers. Conse-quently, both consumers and <b>other</b> <b>food</b> chain actors want more information about organic food production and more visibility and public sales promotion activi-ties for organic products...|$|R
