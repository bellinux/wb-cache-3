5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E

5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the house was finished. Federal Hill was once {{believed to be the first}} brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, the C {{recognised}} the {{deficiencies of}} the section between Borough station and King William Street. A new route was chosen with a different pair of tunnels, avoiding this section. Near Borough, the new tunnels would branch off to London Bridge to form an interchange with the mainline station and then north through the City of London to Angel. The plan was approved on 24 August 1893 following a delay. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant more time to build the southern extension to Clapham. The new route and {{the first section of}} the northern extension from Borough to Moorgate opened on 25 February 1900, and the King William Street diversion was closed. The southern extension to Clapham Common opened on 3 June 1900. Work continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the northern extension and it opened on 17 November 1901.|$|E
40|$|Barbiturate-induced {{anesthesia}} is {{a complex}} mechanism that probably involves several ligand-gated ion channel superfami-lies. One of these superfamilies includes the archetypical nic-otinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), in which barbiturates act as noncompetitive antagonists. In this regard, we used the Torpedo californica nAChR {{and a series of}} barbiturate analogs to characterize the barbiturate binding site(s) on this superfam-ily member. [14 C]Amobarbital binds to one high-affinity (Kd 3. 7 M) and several (11) low-affinity (Kd 930 M) sites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> and desensitized nAChRs, respectively. Character-istics of the barbiturate binding site <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> nAChR include: (1) a tight structure-activity relationship.

5|$|Manningham Rugby Football Club, {{formed in}} 1876, {{originally}} played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground {{was sold to}} facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of the land in}} time to play there for the 1886–87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years prior}} to the game's events, the world was {{controlled}} by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his goodness, causing him to turn into a vicious dictator who declared war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Erion. During his conquests, the Cauldron went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a single night — everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over the possession of the Cauldron in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the Cauldron as too dangerous for the other to possess.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.

Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E

However, he was omitted from the senior team and {{sent back to the}} Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months, playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda. He took 20 wickets at 20.40, including a best of 6/41 against Gujarat, and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out. Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai, taking 1/69 from nine overs. Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More.|$|E

It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E

5|$|With the Soviet forces cut in half, {{the attack}} on the Karelian Isthmus could commence.

By mid-August the encirclement succeeded and both towns were taken but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, {{the attack on}} Viborg was launched. With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to encircle Vyborg by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Karelian Isthmus.

5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded.
