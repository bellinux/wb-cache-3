5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission <b>of</b> <b>HIV,</b> several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission <b>of</b> <b>HIV.</b> However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate <b>of</b> <b>HIV.</b> Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) exhibits immunological hypervariability, {{which has been}} an obstacle to successful production of effective anti-HIV vaccines. In this study, we estimated patterns of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in the env gene <b>of</b> <b>HIVs,</b> {{with the aim of}} finding characteristics of the mechanism which generates the immunological diversity of the env protein <b>of</b> <b>HIVs.</b> We found that nucleotide changes between A and G are predominant compared to those between other nucleotides. Since this feature is consistent with the pattern of nucleotide substitutions of other retroviral genes but is quite different from those of most eukaryotic genes, a high rate of nucleotide substitution between A and G appears to be specific for retroviruses including HIVs. We discuss the biological relationship between this biased substitution and the mechanism generating hypervariability of epitopes on the env protein <b>of</b> <b>HIVs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Two types <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> {{have been}} characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is {{the virus that}} was {{initially}} discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective, and {{is the cause of}} the majority <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> infection is less than 1% per year. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.

5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains <b>of</b> <b>HIV.</b> When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E
