The impact of such an injury can cause lifelong impairment, including <b>occupational</b> <b>restrictions,</b> as well as cognitive, behavioral and emotional sequelae (Ponsford et al., 2014).

Jonathan Frankel notes that this stereotype, though obviously an exaggeration, had a solid basis in reality. While not all Jews were moneylenders, {{it does seem to}} have been true that Jews were disproportionately represented in the trade.|$|R

In part, this is a reflection of the limited set of harmonised characteristics that are available for analysis. It is also a clear indication of how important nuanced factors that extend beyond standardised language tests and measures of experience are for administering migration policy. Establishment of effective pathways to permanent residence (e.g. the facilitation of conversion from temporary student to independent skilled migrant status), <b>occupational</b> <b>restrictions</b> that are tailored to local labour market conditions, and processes that distinguish useful qualifications and experience are all likely to be important to ensure that migrants “hit the ground running” from a labour market perspective.|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{dyscalculia}} (DD) and {{its treatment}} are receiving increasing research attention. A PsychInfo search for peer-reviewed articles with dyscalculia as a title word reveals 31 papers published from 1991 - 2001, versus 74 papers published from 2002 - 2012. Still, these small counts reflect {{the paucity of}} research on DD compared to dyslexia, despite the prevalence of mathematical difficulties. In the UK, 22 % of adults have mathematical difficulties sufficient to impose severe practical and <b>occupational</b> <b>restrictions</b> (Bynner and Parsons, 1997; National Center for Education Statistics, 2011). It is unlikely {{that all of these}} individuals with mathematical difficulties have DD, but criteria for defining and diagnosing dyscalculia remain ambiguous (Mazzocco and Myers, 2003). What is treated as DD in one study may be conceptualized as another form of mathematical impairment in another study. Furthermore, DD is frequently-but, we believe, mistakenly- considered a largely homogeneous disorder. Here we advocate a differential and developmental perspective on DD focused on identifying behavioral, cognitive, and neural sources of individual differences that contribute to our understanding of what DD is and what it is not. © 2013 Kaufmann, Mazzocco, Dowker, von Aster, Göbel, Grabner, Henik, Jordan, Karmiloff-Smith, Kucian, Rubinsten, Szucs, Shalev and Nuerk...|$|R

While 34 professional occupations are analyzed, special {{attention is focused on}} the legal profession.

2500|$|Once the Germans invaded, many Jews fled {{away from}} the {{advancing}} forces but France's rapid collapse both militarily and politically, the armistice, and {{the speed at which}} everything happened trapped many of them in southern France. Philippe Pétain, who became the French premier after Paris had fallen to the German Army, arranged the surrender to Germany. He then became the head of the Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, claiming that it would soften the hardships of occupation. Opposition to the German occupation of northern France and the collaborationist Vichy government was left to the French Resistance within France and the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle outside France. German occupation was quickly accompanied by harsh treatment; Jews were expelled from Alsace Lorraine and their property was confiscated, whereas foreign Jews—around 32,000—were interned following a Vichy decree on 4 October 1940. Additional discriminatory measures soon followed and intensified after the Nazis issued an ordinance on 27 September 1940; these were carried out by the French administration and included: identification requirements for Jews, a census to account for all Jewish persons and businesses, expropriation and [...] "Aryanization" [...] of property, along with <b>occupational</b> <b>restrictions</b> and bans. On 7 October 1940, Pétain's government repealed the Crémieux Law, a move which deprived 117,000 French Jews of the civil rights they were granted in 1870.|$|R

40|$|Re-licensing {{requirements}} for professionals that move across borders are widespread. In this Paper, we measure the returns to an occupational license using novel data on Soviet trained physicians that immigrated to Israel. An immigrant re-training assignment rule {{used by the}} Israel Ministry of Health pro- ides an exogenous source of variation in re-licensing outcomes. Instrumental variables and quantile treatment effects estimates of the returns to an occupa- ional license indicate excess wages due to <b>occupational</b> entry <b>restrictions</b> and negative selection into licensing status. We develop a model of optimal license acquisition that suggests that the wages of high-skilled immigrant physicians in the non-physician sector outweigh the lower direct costs that these immigrants face in acquiring a medical license. Licensing thus leads to lower average quality of service. The positive earnings effect of entry restrictions far outweighs the lower practitioner quality earnings effect that licensing induces. immigration; information and product quality; licensing; occupational mobility; quantile regression; quantile treatment effects model; regression discontinuity design; regulation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is an {{increasingly}} common condition worldwide with significant {{costs associated with}} its management. Identification of musculoskeletal risk factors that can be treated clinically before the development of LBP could reduce costs and {{improve the quality of}} life of individuals. Therefore the aim was to systematically review prospective cohort studies investigating lower back and / or lower limb musculoskeletal risk factors in the development of LBP. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2016. No age, gender or <b>occupational</b> <b>restrictions</b> of participants were applied. Articles had to be published in English and have a 12 month follow-up period. Musculoskeletal risk factors were defined as any osseous, ligamentous, or muscular structure that was quantifiably measured at baseline. Studies were excluded if participants were pregnant, diagnosed with cancer, or had previous low back surgery. Two authors independently reviewed and selected relevant articles. Methodological quality was evaluated independently by two reviewers using a generic tool for observational studies. Results: Twelve articles which evaluated musculoskeletal risk factors for the development of low back pain in 5459 participants were included. Individual meta-analyses were conducted based on risk factors common between studies. Meta-analysis revealed that reduced lateral flexion range of motion (OR[*]=[*] 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 73, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), limited lumbar lordosis (OR[*]=[*] 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 98, p[*]=[*] 0. 034), and restricted hamstring range of motion (OR[*]=[*] 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 94 - 0. 98, p[*]=[*] 0. 001) were significantly associated with the development of low back pain. Meta-analyses on lumbar extension range of motion, quadriceps flexibility, fingertip to floor distance, lumbar flexion range of motion, back muscle strength, back muscle endurance, abdominal strength, erector spinae cross sectional area, and quadratus lumborum cross sectional area showed non-significant results. Conclusion: In summary, we found that a restriction in lateral flexion and hamstring range of motion as well as limited lumbar lordosis were associated with an increased risk of developing LBP. Future research should aim to measure additional lower limb musculoskeletal risk factors, have follow up periods of 6 - 12 months, adopt a standardised definition of LBP, and only include participants who have no history of LBP...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Doctors are {{at higher}} risk of suicide than many other {{occupational}} groups. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate factors associated with suicide in doctors. METHOD: Psychological autopsy study of 38 working doctors who died by suicide in England and Wales between January 1991 and December 1993. RESULTS: Psychiatric illness was present in 25 of the doctors. Depressive illness and drug or alcohol abuse were the most common diagnoses. Twenty-five doctors had significant problems related to work, 14 had relationship problems and 10 had financial problems. Multiple and interrelated problems were often present. The most common method of suicide was self-poisoning, often with drugs taken from work. CONCLUSION: Prevention of suicide in doctors requires a range of strategies, including improved management of psychiatric disorder, measures to reduce <b>occupational</b> stress and <b>restriction</b> of access to means of suicide when doctors are depressed...|$|R

40|$|In {{occupational}} epidemiology, {{the need}} to consider the age factor properly influences the choice of study design and analytical techniques. In most studies, age is viewed as a potential confounder. Age is strongly associated with end points of interest in occupational epidemiology (diseases, physiological characteristics, doses of xenobiotics, etc), but to measure age as a confounder it must be associated with the exposure under study. When the exposure of interest is time related-for example, duration of employment, time since first exposure, cumulative exposure-a strong intrinsic association with age can be anticipated, and age will behave as a (usually strong) confounder. When occupational exposures without a direct relation with age-for example, job, department, type of exposure-are evaluated, the degree and direction of confounding bias cannot be anticipated. Control of the confounding effect of age can be accomplished in the design phase of a study by way of randomisation, restriction, and matching. Randomisation is seldom viable in <b>occupational</b> settings. <b>Restriction</b> is rarely used in the case of age. Matching is often used in a case-control study as a method to increase the study efficiency, but it must be followed by proper matched or stratified analysis. Options for age adjustment in the analysis phase involve stratification and regression methods. In longitudinal studies the modified life table analysis is used {{to take into account the}} fact that subjects cross categories of age as the study proceeds. Stability of relative measures of effect over age strata favoured the greater use of relative risks than risk differences. In the presence of effect modification the influence of age should not be eliminated; its interaction with exposure should be explicitly considered...|$|R
40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is {{an international}} crime renowned for extreme forms of violence against women, men and children. Although trafficking-related violence has been well-documented, the health of trafficked persons has been a largely neglected topic. For people who are trafficked, health risks and consequences may begin before they are recruited into the trafficking process, continue throughout the period of exploitation and persist even after individuals are released. Policy-making, service provision and research often focus narrowly on criminal violations that occur {{during the period of}} exploitation, regularly overlooking the health implications of trafficking. Similarly, the public health sector has not yet incorporated human trafficking as a health concern. We present a conceptual model that highlights the migratory and exploitative nature of a multi-staged trafficking process, which includes: 'recruitment', travel-transit', 'exploitation' and 'integration' or 'reintegration', and for some trafficked persons, 'detention' and 're-trafficking' stages. Trafficked persons may suffer from physical, sexual and psychological harm, <b>occupational</b> hazards, legal <b>restrictions</b> and difficulties associated with being marginalised or stigmatised. Researchers and decision-makers will benefit from a theoretical approach that conceptualizes trafficking and health as a multi-staged process of cumulative harm. To address a health risk such as trafficking, which spans geographical boundaries and involves multiple sectors, including immigration and law enforcement, labour, social and health services, interventions must be coordinated between nations and across sectors to promote the protection and recovery of people who are trafficked.

40|$|This thesis explores {{occupational}} fatalities to American males for {{the years}} 1998 and 1999. The focus is on predicting {{the likelihood that the}} individual will sustain an occupational injury resulting in death based on an occupational status score. Demographic variables measuring Southern residence, race, ethnicity, marital status, education and age were also included in analyses. Research questions include whether or not individuals in higher status occupations are at a decreased risk of sustaining an occupational fatality, and how the demographic variables included effect occupational fatalities. Using data from death certificates allowed me to measure the individual?s occupational status based on their ?usual occupation? and find out whether or not differences exist. The thesis involves two analyses, one with the sample comprised of only males between the ages of 25 and 55 and one including only married males between the ages of 25 and 55. Logistic regression is employed as the method of analysis to model the odds of the risk of sustaining an occupational fatality that results in death. The results of the first model found only marital status to be positively and significantly related to occupational fatalities. Black, Hispanic, South and education were found to be negatively related to occupational fatalities. The main hypothesis of this thesis was not supported, however because the regression shows that with each increase on the occupational status index, no significant increase or decrease occurred in sustaining an occupational injury that resulted in death. In the second regression that included only married males, many of the relationships no longer existed. Hispanic and the education variable both lost statistical significance. The only variables to maintain significance were black and South, which were both associated with a decreased risk of sustaining an occupational injury that resulted in death. Problems with the occupational status index as a predictor for the likelihood of sustaining an <b>occupational</b> fatality and <b>restrictions</b> of the data may be the main issue that resulted in a lack of findings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (POP) is {{a common}} health problem affecting nearby 40 % of multi Para women above 35 years of age. The life-time risk for women to undergo surgery {{for the management of}} POP is about 11 %.   30 % of these (11 %) women will need additional surgery due to prolapse recurrence. The risk of POP increases with the number of vaginal births and is higher in older and obese women. POP has significant negative effects on a woman’s quality of life, ranging from physical discomfort, psychological and sexual complaints to <b>occupational</b> and social <b>restrictions.</b> Methods: This is a community based cross sectional descriptive study carried out for the 141 women, who experienced at least one time pregnancy. The study was conducted in two phases, in the first phase; a structured questionnaire was prepared and screening of cases done by the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) at household level. In the second phase, outreach examination camps were conducted for the screened cases by a Gynecologist. The degree of severity of cases was decided using a Standard Score System. Results: The finding of the study revealed that {{the mean age of the}} respondents was 36. 3 years. Majority of the respondents (41. 5 %) were of age > 36 years and only 1 % were of the below 20 years. The majority of the respondents were from SC/ST community with 43 % schedule caste and 38. 7 % schedule tribe. A good percentage of respondents were literate (58. 8 %), with 17 % respondent having education level of primary and junior and 1. 9 % having above high school level. 37. 7 % of respondents were occupied with agriculture activities and 46. 7 were housewife. The major source of income for more than half of the respondents was agriculture (56. 6 %). Two third of the respondents were living in joint families households (74. 2 %).   Conclusions : The study revealed that the higher burden of uterus prolapse is found in those with poor economic background, those aged above 30 years and with more than two deliveries conducted at home. Median time for prolapse suffering was two years. The age of respondents, occupation, age at first birth, place of delivery, work load during the peurperium period, time to resume work after delivery, number of delivery and person providing assistant during delivery are the key associated factors. </p...|$|R
