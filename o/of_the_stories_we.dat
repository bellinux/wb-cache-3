5000|$|Various dates {{have been}} {{proposed}} for the first written copies. Geoffrey Lewis dates it fairly early in the 15th century, with two layers of text: a substratum of older oral traditions related to conflicts between the Oghuz and the Pecheneks and Kipchaks and an outer covering of references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation. Cemal Kafadar agrees {{that it was no}} earlier than the 15th century since [...] "the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and the Ottoman rulers". However, in his history of the Ottoman Empire, Stanford Jay Shaw (1977) dates it in the 14th century. Professor Michael E. Meeker argues for two dates, saying that the versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> have today originated as folk stories and songs no earlier than the 13th century and were written down no later than the early the 15th century. At least one of the stories (Chapter 8) existed in writing {{at the beginning of the}} 14th century, from an unpublished Arabic history, Dawadari's Durar al-Tijan, written in Egypt some time between 1309 and 1340.|$|E

5000|$|Based on 126 reviews {{collected}} by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron has an overall approval rating of 69% and a weighted average score of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: [...] "A visually stunning film {{that may be}} too predictable and politically correct for adults, but should serve children well." [...] Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 52 based on 29 reviews, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Critic Roger Ebert, said in his review of the film, [...] "Uncluttered by comic supporting characters and cute sidekicks, Spirit is more pure and direct than most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> see in animation - a fable I suspect younger viewers will strongly identify with." [...] Leonard Maltin called it [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} and exciting animated features ever made". Clay Smith of Access Hollywood considered the film [...] "An Instant Classic". The film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Rain received an honorary registration certificate from the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), which has registered more than 670,000 American Paint Horses to date. She is the first animated horse to be registered by this organization.|$|E
5000|$|Abrams {{suggested}} that the show be told with {{the perspective of the}} [...] "hosts" [...] in mind. Nolan took inspiration from video games like BioShock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to deal with the narrative's moral component on a spectrum. During the research, the films of Sergio Leone provided reference points for the characters and visuals, novels by Philip K. Dick informed them about dilemmas concerning artificial intelligence, and for world-building and interlocking narrative, they consulted the Grand Theft Auto games. Nolan explained the show would explore why [...] "violence is in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> like to watch, but it isn't part of what we like to do" [...] through the characters known as guests, who give payment to satisfy those urges. The autonomous existence of non-player characters in video games influenced the approach to the individual storylines in Westworld that are reset in a continuous loop. A recitation from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet—"These violent delights have violent ends"—is made part of the show as a virus trigger within the hosts that alters how they perceive their existence. The series explores ideas about the bicameral mind by Julian Jaynes, about the existence of two separate minds—one that gives instructions and another that performs them, and how consciousness comes from breaking down the wall between them by exposing the individual to new kinds of stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Is Baudolino an {{ambiguous}} game about truth and lies? Eco's medieval metafiction entertains with philosophical insights about the makings and meanings of truth.

The confusion of textual worlds with the empirical world and a reversed logic {{of cause and effect}} produce paradoxical truth-effects, whereas possibility is the precondition for hope; hope that can bring into being the desires and dreams that are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell about ourselves...|$|E

40|$|Who Do You Think You Are’isacclaimed as {{the best}} {{critical}} book of Munro’s career andis awarded with Governor General’s award, Canada highest literary prize. The {{title of the book}} itself refers tothe question of identity. In Munro’s earlier work, the search for identity is limited to the social milieu, where protagonists struggle against stereotypical gender norms to assert their own identity but this collection of short story reflects the battle of identity that isfoughtwithin the self and hence become a psychological struggle. Munro goes beyond the tradition of bildungsroman as a genre which explores the growing up of a male hero. She denies the chronological progression as in a conventional bildungsroman in order to explore the unequal opportunities and the power struggle of growing up of female protagonist so that she could realizeher true self. Thus, a full and far-reaching portrayal of female life and creativity is centered through Rose’s life with a candid attitude. Through the unfolding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>we</b> find an unapologetic insight into human behavior what turns out for Rose’s search for space in society. Hence, this paper endeavors to explore various elements of the protagonist’s struggle to find and shape her own identity; how she deniesbeing a puppet in the hands of others overstepping societal boundaries only to create space and a distinct identity thereupon in this patriarchal world...|$|E
40|$|Many {{educators}} will {{be familiar}} with the power of stories to stimulate rich and meaningful philosophical enquiry on ethical issues with of children. In this paper, I present a view of the nature of narrative and ethics – and {{the relationship between the two}} – that attempts to explain why this is the case. It is not an accident that ethical matters are illuminated to children and adults alike in stories, nor is the explanation of this fitness for purpose, merely pragmatic, or a matter of convention. Narrative, I argue, is at the heart of ethical life and learning. We live and learn by virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell and the stories that are told to us. This is possible not only because these stories present us with vivid ethical content, but also because successful engagement with and enjoyment of these narratives requires the exercise of capacities that also help us lead good lives. Narrative is central, in two respects, to learning how to live a good live and living it: it is both source and a method of ethical knowledge and understanding. Crucially for educators narrative is a rich and abundant source and a method that can be easily grasped and then practiced and improved upon. For those who find this account persuasive, I conclude with som...|$|E

Our journeys have not followed the standard stages of grief and we find ourselves still grappling with loss many years on. We explore how {{the act of writing}} has offered spaces of reflection, spaces of raw connection, spaces to sit with our lives, values and perspectives. We explore how the act of sharing our writing with another, with a view to writing into even more public spaces, has taken us into vulnerable realms where intense emotions are processed actively and windows into experiences deliberately opened, at once letting out pain but also allowing in new ways of being, seeing and thinking about our mourning. Strangely our presentation also connects us to the sense of loss that we have felt in the academy, our longings to ‘be’ differently in academia. And so we ponder the relationships that exist when one engages in reconciliation and reclamation across personal/professional territories, and share our tentative steps to unearth our stories and expand safe spaces for humanising life and work.
