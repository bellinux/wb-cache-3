5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than in <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of the East German armed forces. Many potential recruits {{were screened}} out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany. They were all subjected to close scrutiny to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government to interfere with <b>other</b> <b>branches,</b> the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E
5|$|Several famous {{individuals}} {{became involved}} with Dianetics. Aldous Huxley received auditing from Hubbard himself; the poet Jean Toomer and the science fiction writers Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt became trained Dianetics auditors.

5|$|Then, late in 1983, the U.S. {{government}} made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter, the IAI Lavi. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi {{would be a}} potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor. Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop's complaints along with complaints from <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of the government.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} Street Fighter titles relied almost {{solely on}} Capcom's Research and Development branch, the development team instead allowed <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> {{of the company}} to give input {{on the design of}} new characters, due to the influx of fan requests from outside Japan. Rufus was designed based upon marketing research on what sorts of characters an American audience would enjoy playing, and was one of several characters considered for inclusion during the game's development.|$|E
5|$|By 1821, Stratford {{was served}} {{by a number of}} wharves, some located on the Lea and others on the Channelsea River or <b>other</b> <b>branches.</b> In {{addition}} to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, stone, coal, or wheat. Several of the factories and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust. Half of it had been filled in by 1896, and the rest by 1920.|$|E

5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} branch, Zero manages to kill {{all of her}} sisters and absorb their powers, {{managing}} to take down One with help from Accord. After absorbing all their powers, she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic is sealed away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form. In the novel Drag-On Dragoon 3 Story Side, a novel detailing the events leading directly into Drakengard, a combination of events from <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> occurs. During the final confrontation with One, Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him. After killing One, One's clone kills Zero.|$|E

5|$|Staff {{working for}} British Airways are {{represented}} {{by a number of}} trade unions, pilots {{are represented by}} British Air Line Pilots' Association, cabin crew by British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (a branch of Unite the Union), while <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of Unite the Union and the GMB Union represent other employees. Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.|$|E

5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court.
