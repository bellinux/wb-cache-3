It would kick off with an attack by the U.S. reserve units on the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River {{in the middle of}} the month. One of Walker's goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near Taegu by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On 6 August, the Eighth Army issued the <b>operational</b> <b>directive</b> for the attack by the task force. The plan of attack was to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River, and depended on the arrival of the entire U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks which were en route from the United States.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, the US Eighth Army {{issued an}} <b>operational</b> <b>directive</b> to all UN ground forces in Korea for their planned {{withdrawal}} {{east of the}} Naktong River. UN units would then establish main defensive positions behind {{what was to be}} called the Pusan Perimeter. The intent was to draw the line on retreating and hold off the Korean People's Army while the U.S. Army built up its forces and launch a counteroffensive. The US 25th Infantry Division held the southernmost flank at Masan, while the 24th Infantry Division withdrew to Koch'ang. The 1st Cavalry Division withdrew to Waegwan. US forces demolished all bridges over the Naktong River in the retreat. At one bridge in the 1st Cavalry Division sector, the division commander attempted several times to clear refugees from the bridge but they continued to cross it despite warnings and several attempts to clear the bridge. Eventually the commander was forced to demolish the bridge, taking several hundred refugees with it.|$|E

The 2nd Army Group requested and received an extension of the ultimatum in order to confer with the Supreme Command. The next day, the Supreme Command ordered the 2nd Army Group and 4th Army to cease all military operations and not to resist the Germans. The Germans captured the Supreme Command on 15 April outside Sarajevo, where the staff was waiting to surrender. Despite being a prisoner of war, Kalafatović authorised his deputy chief of staff, Radivoje Janković, to sign an armistice and unconditional surrender with the Axis, effective at noon on 18 April.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. We model the minimum-cost procurement and allocation of anti-ship cruise missiles to naval combat ships as a two-period stochastic integer program. Discrete scenarios in two periods define "demands" for missiles (i. e., targets {{and number of}} missiles required to kill those targets), which must be met with sufficiently high probabilities. After the former combat period, ships may replenish their inventories from a depot if desired and if the available depot inventory suffices. A force commander optimizes ship-to-target assignments to meet demands. The basic model solves slowly, so we add constraints to enforce reasonable <b>operational</b> <b>directives,</b> and add valid inequalities.
