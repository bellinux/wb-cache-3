5|$|Uncle David is a 2010 British black comedy film {{directed}} by David Hoyle, Gary Reich, and Mike Nicholls. It {{was produced by}} Reich and stars Hoyle, an English performance artist, in the titular role alongside English pornographic actor Ashley Ryder. Developed collectively under the banner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Avant-Garde</b> Alliance, it was filmed in October 2009. Created without a script, every scene was improvised and filmed in a single take.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde,</b> including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{the end of}} World War II, Romania {{came under}} {{communist}} rule, and a purge of interwar modernist values followed: Urmuz's works were among the many denied imprimatur by the 1950s. Before communist censorship became complete, Urmuz still found disciples in the last wave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde.</b> Cited examples include Geo Dumitrescu, Dimitrie Stelaru and Constant Tonegaru. Also at the time, writer Dinu Pillat donated a batch of Urmuz's manuscripts to the Romanian Academy Library.|$|E
25|$|The Russian avant-garde was a large, {{influential}} wave {{of modernist}} art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related art movements that {{occurred at the}} time, namely neo-primitivism, suprematism, constructivism, rayonism, and Russian Futurism. Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, and Marc Chagall. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism.|$|E
25|$|William Gear – {{a student}} of Fernand Léger and the only British member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> CoBrA {{movement}} – had close links with Birmingham, exhibiting with the Birmingham Artists Committee and forming links with the Birmingham Surrealists in the 1940s, before finally moving {{to the city to}} teach at the School of Art in 1964. Later that decade John Salt's obsessively detailed paintings of cars and mobile homes in the American landscape made him the only major English artist among the pioneers of photorealism.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Romanian <b>avant-garde</b> {{language}} code {{is based on}} the constructive and destructive power <b>of</b> words. <b>The</b> Romanian <b>avant-garde</b> poets used <b>the</b> Romanian lexis as source of creating their specific artistic language. This language is made up of alien terms, dialect terms, cult terms and scientific terms. The most prolific means <b>of</b> ‘building’ <b>the</b> <b>Avant-garde</b> lexicon is <b>the</b> progressive derivation, the paratactic composition, the conversion and the innovated and coined words and languages. <b>The</b> <b>avant-garde</b> poetic language has its source in the most ‘inappropriate’ Romanian words for writing poetry and in <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> word meaning connection, which leads to semantic incoherence...|$|R

25|$|Miró {{initially}} went {{to business}} school {{as well as}} art school. He began his working career {{when he was a}} teenager as a clerk, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown. His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. The resemblance of Miró's work to that of the intermediate generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.|$|E
25|$|The Russian avant-garde is an {{umbrella}} {{term used to}} define the large, influential wave of modernist art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely neo-primitivism, suprematism, constructivism, rayonism, and futurism. Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexander Rodchenko, Pavel Filonov and Marc Chagall. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, {{at which point the}} revolutionary ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain their pre-war status at the {{forefront}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde,</b> and faced {{with the possibility of}} being overthrown by Dada, the cubists regrouped. Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.|$|E

40|$|This work {{intends to}} {{encounter}} the textual corpus constituted by <b>the</b> Expressionist Manifesto <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Die Brücke group <b>of</b> artists. In <b>the</b> first place, with Marshall Berman, we {{must say that}} expressionism is a modern phenomenon, and, more specifically, a modernist one. It is in this last sense {{that we can see}} it as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artistic <b>avant-gardes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century. In the second place, the expressionist movement shows certain specific features that distinguish it from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-gardes,</b> and which we will display along the essay. Since our object of study is a text, certain intellectual history and discourse analysis tools become necessary, so we will be working with the ones provided by Michel Foucault and Jonathan Culler. Finally, since our object is also a manifesto, that is, a specific discursive genre, we will have to analyze it with the tools provided by Eliseo Verón...|$|R

25|$|The {{increasingly}} {{conservative and}} academic juries were not {{receptive to the}} Impressionist painters, whose works were usually rejected, or poorly placed if accepted. The Salon opposed the Impressionists' shift away from traditional painting styles. In 1857 the Salon jury turned away an unusually high number of the submitted paintings. An uproar resulted, particularly from regular exhibitors who had been rejected. In order {{to prove that the}} Salons were democratic, Napoleon III instituted the Salon des Refusés, containing a selection of the works that the Salon had rejected that year. It opened on 17 May 1863, marking the birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde.</b> The Impressionists held their own independent exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886.|$|E
25|$|Penderecki {{explained}} this shift {{by stating that}} he had come to feel that the experimentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: 'The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez and Cage was for us, the young – hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country – a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone'. Penderecki concluded that he was 'saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition'.|$|E
25|$|From 1958 Ballard {{worked as}} {{assistant}} editor on the scientific journal Chemistry and Industry. His interest in art {{led to his}} involvement in the emerging Pop Art movement, and in the late fifties he exhibited a number of collages that represented his ideas for a new kind of novel. Ballard's avant-garde inclinations did not sit comfortably in the science fiction mainstream of that time, which held attitudes he considered philistine. Briefly attending the 1957 Science Fiction Convention in London, Ballard left disillusioned and demoralised and did not write another story for a year. By the late 1960s, however, he had become an editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>avant-garde</b> Ambit magazine, which was more in keeping with his aesthetic ideals.|$|E
