A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like <b>other</b> <b>customers,</b> BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E

5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to <b>other</b> <b>customers,</b> but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E

40|$|RCM is a {{maintenance}} method, {{which comes from}} the airline industry, in the late 1970 's. The method is used to control the maintenance, prevent possible failures and make the maintenance done in an appropriate frequency. To achieve the RCM analysis a RCM team must be created. When implement the RCM method in <b>other</b> <b>customer</b> operational conditions, the method must {{be the same for}} fulfil the SAE maintenance standard. Instead must the implementation process be modificated. This thesis work has been performed at Metso Paper, Service Inc., in Sundsvall. Metso Paper is interested in the RCM process and how it could be used in <b>other</b> <b>customer</b> operational conditions. The purpose with this thesis report was to define what the RCM method is, try to find suggestions of how to implement the RCM method into <b>other</b> <b>customer</b> operational conditions. There was also pilot project done on a twin wire press, to really se how the RCM analysis was performed. The pilot project were limited to five sub-systems of the twin wire press.

To successfully implement the RCM method into <b>other</b> <b>customer</b> operational conditions and in their maintenance organizations, must a very good understanding about their culture be made.
