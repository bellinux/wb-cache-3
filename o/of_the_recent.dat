5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up in the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E

The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> eruption, slowing the recovery process.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E

Ann (Rashida Jones) feels awkward now that Chris is back; the two previously dated, but Chris broke up with Ann in such a friendly manner {{that she did not}} initially realize it was a break-up. Leslie invites Ann to the camping trip to help her feel better.|$|E

He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E
5|$|In July 1170, Becket and {{the king}} were {{reconciled}} {{and the king}} agreed that the archiepiscopal estates would be returned to Becket's control. But difficulties dragged on and Becket accused de Broc of stripping the estates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> harvest and storing {{it away from the}} archbishop's control. In November, John of Salisbury was sent by Becket to England to inspect the estates prior to Becket's return from exile. John claimed that although de Broc had originally returned custody of the estates to Becket's officials, shortly before John's arrival de Broc had regained control of the estates and expelled Becket's officials. De Broc was also accused of seizing a cargo of the archbishop's wine and destroying the ship carrying it.|$|E

5|$|In November 1830, a National Congress was {{established}} to create a Belgian constitution. Fears of mob rule associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, {{as well as the}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. The Congress approached several candidates, but chose Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a minor but well-connected German noble, to be the first King of the Belgians. He was officially inaugurated on 21 July 1831, after taking an oath to abide by the Constitution. Leopold I was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed {{to the production of}} two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
5|$|In the Crimea, Heber {{encountered}} the region's large Muslim community, and observed eastern manners and practices {{for the first}} time. He expressed particular pleasure at being greeted with the oriental salaam. The {{course of the war}} in Europe had meanwhile shifted, so that Heber and Thornton were able, on the final stages of their journey, to pass through Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany to reach the port of Hamburg. On the way they visited Austerlitz, where they heard accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> battle from the local population. In the course of his enquiries, which included making sketches of the scene, Heber was briefly mistaken for a French spy by local farmers. At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth's private yacht and sailed for England, arriving at Great Yarmouth on 14 October 1806.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the origins}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> {{conflict}} {{in what is now}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which then led to the Great Lakes refugee crisis. Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in Goma in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan Hutu fighters, who were eventually organised into the Rassemblement Démocratique pour le Rwanda, who launched repeated attacks into Rwanda. Rwanda eventually backed Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his quickly organised Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on Rwanda in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by Rwanda, the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing the overthrow of Mobutu in 1997.|$|E
