50|$|Reaction of {{chloroacetonitrile}} (1) with methanol {{and hydrogen}} chloride {{leads to the}} corresponding iminoether (Pinner reaction). Condensation of 2 with 3-methylaminopropylamine gives (3) gives the corresponding tetrahydropyrimidine (4). Displacement of the halogen with the sodium salt 5 affords <b>oxyphencyclimine</b> (6).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{anticholinergic}} agents—atropine, propantheline, <b>oxyphencyclimine,</b> and propionyl atropine methyl nitrate—on silva flow and on hypoglycaemic stimulated gastric secretion has been studied. The acid secretion {{of the nervous}} phase of gastric secretion was inhibited by anticholinergic drugs. They influenced gastric secretion {{to a greater extent}} than saliva flow...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the binding {{properties of the}} (R) - and (S) -enantiomers of the muscarinic antagonists trihexyphenidyl, procyclidine, hexahydro-difenidol, p-fluoro-hexahydro-difenidol, hexbutinol, p-fluoro-hexbutinol, and their corresponding methiodides at muscarinic M 1, M 2, M 3 and M 4 receptor subtypes. In addition, binding properties of the (R) - and (S) -enantiomers of <b>oxyphencyclimine</b> were studied. The (R) -enantiomers (eutomers) of all the compounds had a greater affinity than the (S) -isomers for the four muscarinic receptor subtypes. The binding patterns of the (R) - and (S) -enantiomers were generally different. We did not observe any general correlation between the potency of the high-affinity enantiomer and the affinity ratio (eudismic ratio) of the two enantiomers. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a 'four subsites' binding model. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{receptor}} affinities of 18 anticholinergics, {{expressed as}} dissociation constants, were determined {{in order to}} select the most active compounds. Six drugs showed high affinities towards the muscarinic receptor (K-d < 30 nM), and these compounds were selected as possible candidates for transdermal drug delivery because they can theoretically provide therapeutic plasma concentrations by dermal application on a limited area. From the six selected anticholinergics (atropine sulphate monohydrate. benztropine mesylate, dexetimide hydrochloride, <b>oxyphencyclimine</b> hydrochloride, scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate; tropicamide), the physicochemical characteristics are described, together with atropine base. These characteristics {{may be useful to}} explain possible differences in permeation experiments. The chemical structures, molecular weights, and pK(a) values were available from the literature. The partition coefficients, and the solubility, pH and stability in the dosing and receptor solutions were experimentally determined. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
