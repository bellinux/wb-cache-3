The {{aim of this}} pilot study {{was to assess the}} efficacy and safety of <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in epidural blockade among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients and methods: In 11 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system II/III, age range: 59 – 82 years), THA was conducted with an epidural blockade using 15 mL 0. 25 % bupivacaine (37. 5 mg) with 5 mg <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and sedation with propofol infusion at a dose of 3 – 5 mg/kg/h. After the surgery, patients received ketoprofen at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. In the first 24 hours postoperative period, pain was assessed by numerical rating scale at rest and on movement; adverse effects (AEs) were recorded; and plasma concentrations of oxycodone, noroxycodone, and bupivacaine were measured. Results: The administration of epidural oxycodone at a dose of 5 mg in patients undergoing THA provided analgesia for a mean time of 10. 3 ± 4. 89 h. In one patient, mild pruritus was observed. Oxycodone did not evoke other AEs. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone while preserving analgesia were > 2. 9 ng/mL. Noroxycodone concentrations in plasma did not guarantee analgesic effect. Conclusion: The administration of epidural oxycodone at a dose of 5 mg prolongs the analgesia period to ~ 10 hours in patients after THA. Oxycodone may evoke pruritus.

Hydromorphone is an opioid analgesic that is routinely {{used instead of}} morphine for cancer pain; however, {{it is not yet}} available in Japan. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone (DS- 7113 b) extended-release tablets in opioid-naïve patients with cancer pain not relieved by non-opioid analgesics. Subjects and methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. A double-dummy method was used for blinding. Each randomized subject received either hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus placebo <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> extended-release tablets 4 mg/day (n= 88) or placebo hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> extended-release tablets 10 mg/day (n= 93) orally for 7 days (once-daily dosing for hydromorphone and twice-daily dosing for oxycodone). The doses were adjusted as necessary. Efficacy was evaluated by change in visual analog scale (VAS) score from baseline to completion of treatment. Results: The between-group difference in least squares mean changes in VAS score from baseline to completion or discontinuation of treatment was − 0. 4 mm (95 % CI − 5. 9 to 5 mm) by analysis of covariance where the baseline VAS score was used as a covariate. The upper limit of the 95 % CI was below 10 mm, which was predefined as the noninferiority limit. This verified the noninferiority of hydromorphone tablets relative to oxycodone tablets. The incidence of adverse events was 80. 7 % (71 of 88) in the hydromorphone group and 83. 7 % (77 of 93) in the oxycodone group. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, and constipation, most of which are commonly observed with opioid analgesics. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of hydromorphone extended-release tablets were equivalent to those of the oxycodone extended-release formulation.

40|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> controlled-release, {{also known}} as extended-release {{oxycodone}} (ER oxycodone), was reformulated with physicochemical barriers to crushing and dissolving intended to reduce abuse through nonoral routes of administration (ROAs) that require tampering (eg, injecting and snorting). Manufacturer shipments of original ER oxycodone (OC) stopped on August 5, 2010, and reformulated ER oxycodone (ORF) shipments started August 9, 2010. A sentinel surveillance sample of 140, 496 individuals assessed for substance abuse treatment at 357 U. S. centers between June 1, 2009, and March 31, 2012, was examined for prevalence and prescription-adjusted prevalence rates of past- 30 -day abuse via any route, as well as abuse through oral, nonoral, and specific ROAs for ER oxycodone and comparators (ER morphine and ER oxymorphone) before and after ORF introduction. Significant reductions occurred for 8 outcome measures of ORF versus OC historically. Abuse of ORF was 41 % lower (95 % CI: - 44 to - 37) than historical abuse for OC, with oral abuse 17 % lower (95 % CI: - 23 to - 10) and nonoral abuse 66 % lower (95 % CI: - 69 to - 63).

Although some pain symptoms can be effectively treated by dopaminergic medication, a correct diagnosis of the different types and distribution of pain in PD is challenging, and accordingly, its treatment remains troublesome. We evaluated the efficacy and the safety of a prolonged release oral formulation of <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> combined with naloxone hydrochloride dehydrate, in a fixed ratio of 2 : 1 (OXN PR). A total of 16 PD patients with history of pain with a minimum intensity of four on numerical rating scale (NRS) received low-dose OXN PR (5 / 2. 5  mg twice daily) and were observed for a period of 8  weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the pain severity measured with NRS and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary efficacy measured the safety profile by recording the occurrence of side effects, clinical global impression of change (CGI-C), Parkinson's disease sleep scale 2 (PDSS- 2), Bowel function index (BFI). Data were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Patients who completed the study (14 out of 16) reported a significant pain relief as observed by the reduction of NRS and BPI scores. No adjustment of dopaminergic therapy was required. No significant changes were observed in bowel function and constipation symptoms as measured by the BFI during the 8 -week period. Similarly, no changes were observed in PDSS- 2 score, whereas an improvement was recorded by CGI-C compared to baseline. Low-dose oral OXN PR was efficacious for the management of pain symptoms of patients with PD. More importantly, patients did not experience significant side effects, such as constipation or sedation.

Nearly all patients with malignant tumors suffer pain at the advanced stage of their disease. Oxycodone is a first-line choice for treating moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain, and OxyContin, a controlled-release <b>oxycodone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> tablet, is internationally recognized as a safe and effective opioid analgesic. OxyContin has the characteristics of both immediate release and sustained release, with a time to onset and peak {{similar to those of}} immediate-release morphine. It acts on both µ and κ receptors and {{has been shown to be}} effective in treating different types of pain, especially neuropathic pain, theoretically without a dose cap. However, the dose is limited in clinical applications due to various factors that are likely to affect its analgesic effect and reduce patient quality of life. Cooperation with a patient’s family members is required during the treatment of cancer pain. Chronic cancer pain has a long disease course, which could easily cause complex psychological symptoms due to their important role in the pain experience. Pain is controllable, and patients have a right to not experience pain. An optimal living state can be achieved through collaboration between physicians and patients. Rational personalized treatment of cancer pain can improve patient quality of life, relieve pain, and help prolong patient survival. This article reports the treatment procedure and adverse reactions in a patient who was treated with high-dose OxyContin, with the aim of providing a reference for other clinical practitioners.
