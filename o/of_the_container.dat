5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which {{is connected to}} a reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In {{order to maintain the}} equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E

50|$|General {{average was}} {{declared}} {{and at least}} one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> were damaged by <b>the</b> blaze. Every <b>container</b> aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure was either incinerated or lost overboard. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure were left intact, although after the ship lost power, any cargo in <b>the</b> refrigerated <b>containers</b> would have spoiled.

5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} was halted {{during the war}} years afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing. Many of them came back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Container</b> Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Luka Rijeka d.d., {{operator}} of the Port of Rijeka, {{signed a contract}} of strategic partnership with the ICTSI and Jadranska vrata d.d.. The partnership aims to expand the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> terminal to 600,000 TEUs. The contract also stipulates that the concession regarding operation of the terminal is to last for 30 years with an investment of 54 million euro. It is estimated that ICTSI and Luka Rijeka d.d. will invest up to one billion kuna (135million euro) in the Port of Rijeka. Upgrades of other port terminals are also planned, with investments through the World Bank and through build-operate-transfer and public–private partnership schemes. They include cargo terminals {{in the city of}} Rijeka and the new passenger terminal opened in October 2009.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> He learns {{that the man}} in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, and the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
50|$|Communicating vessels {{is a name}} {{given to}} a set of {{containers}} containing a homogeneous fluid: when the liquid settles, it balances out to the same level in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape and volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>containers.</b> If additional liquid is added to one vessel, the liquid will again find a new equal level in all the connected vessels. This process is part of Stevin's Law and occurs because gravity and pressure are constant in each vessel (hydrostatic pressure).|$|R

50|$|Container ships {{only take}} 40-foot and 20-foot {{containers}} below deck, plus 45-foot containers above deck. Ninety percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> that container ships carry are 40-foot units. As container ships carry 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's freight, at least 81% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's freight moves via 40-foot containers.|$|R
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> packing <b>container</b> is used {{in storage}} and {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high explosive (HE) material. The study concerns <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> packing <b>container</b> in fire environment. The spruce wood filled in <b>the</b> packing <b>container</b> can effectively resist heat transfer and protect HE material. <b>The</b> thermal analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> packing <b>container</b> in <b>the</b> pool fire environment is presented with the finite element method. When considering the water evaporation and the wood pyrolysis, <b>the</b> enthalpy curve <b>of</b> wood is presented in this study. Heat can be transferred from the fire to <b>the</b> packing <b>container</b> via convection and radiation. Thus, two thermal boundary conditions are applied to <b>the</b> thermal model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> packing <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> simulations show the inner temperature distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> packing <b>container</b> are significantly affected by the wood-column thickness. For the same time, the simulations show there is a slight difference in the char layer thickness between two thickness wood columns. The computed results show there are large temperature gradients in <b>the</b> interface <b>of</b> char and wood. This demonstrates the spruce wood is the excellent thermal resistance material...|$|R
