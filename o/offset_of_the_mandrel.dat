40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel steering mechanism {{embedded in a}} point-the-bit rotary steerable system (RSS) for oilfield exploitation. The new steering mechanism adopts a set of universal joints to alleviate the high alternative strain on drilling mandrel and employs a specially designed planetary gear small tooth number difference (PGSTD) to achieve directional steering. Its principle and characteristics are explained and examined through a series <b>of</b> analyses. First, <b>the</b> eccentric displacement vector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> point on <b>the</b> drilling <b>mandrel</b> is formulated and kinematic solutions are established. Next, structural design for the new steering mechanism is addressed. Then, procedures and program architectures for simulating <b>offset</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilling <b>mandrel</b> and motion trajectory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole steering mechanism are presented. After that, steering motion simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new steering mechanism for both 2 D and 3 D well trajectories are then performed by combining LabVIEW and SolidWorks. Finally, experiments on the steering motion control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new steering mechanism prototype are carried out. The simulations and experiments reveal that <b>the</b> steering performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new steering mechanism is satisfied. The research can provide good guidance for further research and engineering application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point-the-bit RSS...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{circular}} {{braiding process}} {{is adapted to}} produce three-dimensional shapes by braiding over a contoured <b>mandrel.</b> <b>The</b> present work deals with <b>the</b> simulation <b>of</b> various braided structures. The simulated structures are based on geometrical models developed for yarns on different shapes <b>of</b> <b>mandrels.</b> <b>The</b> geometry <b>of</b> a braided structure depends upon the machine parameters, such as number of yarn carriers, rotational speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriers, take-up speed, and <b>the</b> effective perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> cross section. Virtual reality modeling language (VRML) has been employed as a visualization tool to simulate these geometrical models on a predefined mandrel geometry. Models relate to the machine speeds and a number <b>of</b> machine settings. <b>The</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yarn on <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> is dependent upon <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel,</b> i. e., if it is circular {{then it will be}} in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a helix or if it is a cubical body then it will be in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> straight lines. An expert system has been generated to take into account all the parameters interfacing with VRML to simulate the braid geometry.

40|$|International audienceThe design {{procedure}} of nongeodesic filament wound products requires well-determined {{values for the}} available friction situated between the applied roving and the supporting surface.

40|$|NASA uses {{precision}} diamond turning {{technology to}} fabricate replication mandrels for its X-ray Calibration Facility (XRCF) optics. The XRCF optics are tubular, {{and the internal}} surface contains a parabolic profile over the first section and a hyperbolic profile over the last. The optic is fabricated by depositing layers of gold and nickel on to <b>the</b> replication <b>mandrel</b> and then separating it from <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> serves as a replication form, it must contain <b>the</b> inverse image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface. The difficulty in aligning <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> comes from <b>the</b> fabrication steps which it undergoes. <b>The</b> <b>mandrel</b> is rough machined and heat treated prior to diamond turning. After diamond turning, silicon rubber separators which are undercut in radius by 3 mm (0. 12 in.) are inserted between the two end caps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> to allow <b>the</b> plating to wrap around the ends (to prevent flaking). <b>The</b> <b>mandrel</b> is then plated with a nickel-phosphor alloy using an electroless nickel process. At this point, the separators are removed and <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> is reassembled for the final cut on <b>the</b> DTM. <b>The</b> <b>mandrel</b> is measured for profile and finish, and polished to achieve an acceptable surface finish. Wrapping the plating around the edges helps to prevent flaking, but it also destroys the alignment surfaces between <b>the</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> that insure that <b>the</b> axes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parts are coincident. Several mandrels have been realigned by trial-and-error methods, consuming significant amounts of setup time.

Since 50 microns of nickel plating was to be removed, and a minimum plating thickness of 25 microns was {{to remain on the}} part, the radial error motion had to be reduced to less than 25 microns. <b>The</b> <b>mandrel</b> was therefore not usable in its current state...|$|R

Nevertheless, each time unstable crack propagation occurs it is arrested by <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> As a result more crack re-initiations were observed per unit crack length. This effect {{is expected to increase}} <b>the</b> statistical relevance <b>of</b> a single test and thereby increases <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test. As an additional advantage <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> peel test is very easy to perform compared to the DCB test. The crosshead speed and the peel arm width were varied in this study to obtain <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> these variables on the test results. Fractographic investigations were performed to study <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack propagation for the two different testing techniques...|$|R

Optimisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interface requires an evaluation method for these hybrid structures.

2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. <b>The</b> exact placement <b>of</b> these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair <b>of</b> pliers, <b>the</b> reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> (<b>The</b> steam generated by <b>the</b> heated <b>mandrel</b> causes <b>the</b> cane to permanently assume <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.)</b> <b>The</b> upper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|R
