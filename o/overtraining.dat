40|$|Peak torques {{were studied}} in 10 elite male <b>overtrained</b> athletes and 10 {{controls}} matched for sex, age, sport, and performance level. Isokinetic concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of quadriceps muscle were assessed at the angular velocities of 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and 180 degrees. s- 1. Sustained isometric MVCs were also measured at knee angles of 10 degrees, 45 degrees, and 80 degrees of flexion. Six {{seconds after the}} beginning of each isometric MVC, a 40 -Hz electrical stimulation was superimposed on the MVC for a further 6 s. The <b>overtrained</b> subjects developed significantly smaller CON peak torques at 180 degrees. s- 1 (P < 0. 001), although ECC torques were similar at all three velocities. ECC/CON ratios were higher in the <b>overtrained</b> subjects at 120 degrees. s- 1 (P < 0. 01) and 180 degrees. s- 1 (P < 0. 001) compared with the controls. Isometric MVCs at 10 degrees and 45 degrees knee flexion were lower in the <b>overtrained</b> at P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively. Also in the <b>overtrained</b> subjects, at knee angle of 10 degrees, the addition of the electrical stimulation to the isometric MVC produced an increase (P < 0. 05) in torque levels.

50|$|<b>Overtraining</b> is {{the result}} of giving your body more work or stress than it can handle. <b>Overtraining</b> occurs when a person {{experiences}} stress and physical trauma from exercising faster than their body can repair the damage. <b>Overtraining</b> can be described as a point where a person may have a decrease in performance and plateauing as a result from failure to consistently perform at a certain level or training load exceeds their recovery capacity. They cease making progress, and can even begin to lose strength and fitness. <b>Overtraining</b> is also known as chronic fatigue, burnout and overstress in athletes. It is suggested that there are different variations of <b>overtraining,</b> firstly monotonous program over training suggest that repetition of the same movement such as certain weight lifting and baseball batting can cause performance plateau due to an adaption of the central nervous system which results from a lack of stimulation. A second example of <b>overtraining</b> is described as chronic overwork type training where the subject may be training with too high intensity or high volume and not allowing sufficient recovery time for the body. It is important to note the difference between <b>overtraining</b> and over-reaching; over-reaching is when an athlete is undergoing hard training but with adequate recovery, <b>overtraining</b> however, is when an athlete is undergoing hard training without the adequate recovery. Up to 10% of elite endurance athletes and 10% of American college swimmers are affected by <b>overtraining</b> syndrome (unexplained underperformance for approximately 2 weeks even after having adequate resting time).|$|E

40|$|Visuo-motor learning, {{a dynamic}} {{process in which}} visual stimuli are {{associated}} with certain motor responses, leads to goal-directed, complex behaviours. Literature states that the striatum and the hippocampus are two important brain areas {{for this type of}} learning since neural mechanisms and changing activation patterns within these areas are involved in the processing of visual stimuli and the subsequent motor act. The neural activity of mice trained in the Morris water maze was molecularly characterized by in situ hybridization for the immediate early gene activity markers arc and homer 1 a and this in two timeframes, namely the early learning and the late learning (overtrained/automatisation) phase. First results show that in the early learning phase arc mRNA expression appears to be upregulated in the ventrolateral striatum, while in the <b>overtrained</b> phase a higher expression is noticeable in the dorsal striatum. Arc and homer 1 a mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus indicate that this structure is more active in the early learning phase compared to the <b>overtrained</b> phase. Subregional analysis of hippocampal homer 1 a mRNA expression patterns implies an opposite dynamic of CA 1 /DG and CA 3 in response to learning. While CA 1 /DG activity decreases when mice become <b>overtrained,</b> CA 3 activity seems to slightly increase. Further analysis will reveal how differential molecular activity in the subregions of hippocampus and striatum relates to both phases of the visuo-motor learning process. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that previously consolidated episodic memories reenter a labile state after being reactivated by contextual cues, making them susceptible to updating through reconsolidation (Hupbach et al. 2007; Hupbach et al. 2008). However, little is known about boundary conditions that limit reconsolidation in humans. The current study uses the list-learning paradigm established by Hupbach et al. to investigate the boundary of memory strength at 96 hour and 5 week time delays. Participants were <b>overtrained</b> on the initial object set, after which they returned for reactivation (or no reactivation) and learned a second object set. During the third session participants were asked to recall only one of the sets. Updating was assessed by measuring levels of intrusions from the alternate set into the memory of the correct set. <b>Overtrained</b> participants showed similar intrusion patterns to normally-trained participants despite increased correct recall, suggesting updating at 96 hours and no updating at 5 weeks. Implications of the results are discussed, including comparisons to recent animal neuroscience research...|$|R
50|$|<b>Overtraining</b> {{occurs when}} a {{bodybuilder}} has trained {{to the point where}} his workload exceeds his recovery capacity. There are many reasons that <b>overtraining</b> occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) and can result in a hyper-adrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns. To avoid <b>overtraining,</b> intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. Timely provision of carbohydrates, proteins, and various micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical.|$|E

40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{this study}} were a) to verify whether the {{performance}} decrease induced by nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR) is linked to high concentrations of cytokines in serum, skeletal muscles and liver; b) to verify muscle myostatin adaptation to NFOR; c) to verify the effects of chronic glucose supplementation on the parameters mentioned above. Mice were divided into control (C), trained (TR), <b>overtrained</b> (OTR) and supplemented <b>overtrained</b> (OTR + S).

Total blood was collected from decapitation for subsequent determination of cytokine concentrations. Generally, OTR and OTR + S presented higher contents of IL- 6, TNF-alpha, GLUT- 4 and myostatin in muscle samples compared to C and TR. Glucose supplementation attenuated the high contents of IL- 6, TNF-alpha and IL- 15 in liver, and of IL- 6 in serum.

One sign of <b>Overtraining</b> Syndrome (OTS) is suppressed immune function, with an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).
