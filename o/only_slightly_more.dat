5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments.

The 42nd Infantry Regiment could only muster 600 men, and the 89th Infantry Regiment <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more.</b> The divisional cavalry battalion was also heavily reduced in strength, and divisional artillery amounted to one anti-aircraft battery. The border units, responsible for demolition tasks on the line from Bjelovar south to Čazma, refused to follow orders.

The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold {{for use by the}} Arrows team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the Belgian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending Australian Grand Prix, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to EuroBrun team owner Walter Brun for an unknown price.|$|E

5|$|With a mid-level ridge {{located in}} the Gulf of Mexico, the {{depression}} drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55miles (85km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45mph (75km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65mph (100km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection, and at around 1900UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near León, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur.|$|E
