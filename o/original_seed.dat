2500|$|The {{selection}} committee is also instructed to place teams so that whenever possible, {{teams from the}} same conference cannot meet until the regional finals. Additionally, it is also instructed to avoid any possible rematches of regular-season or previous year's tournament games during the First and Second rounds. Further restrictions {{are listed in the}} Venues section below. To comply with these other requirements, the {{selection committee}} may move one or several teams up or down one seed from their respective <b>original</b> <b>seed</b> line. Thus, for example, the 40th overall ranked team, originally slated to be a No. 10 seed within a particular region, may instead be moved up to a No. 9 seed or moved down to a No. 11 seed. In addition, the rankings of the eight teams selected for the [...] "First Four" [...] play-in round will likewise affect the final seedlings.|$|E

After it has sprung up, what does it next, but TILLER?--and every new shoot that tillers out bears its own ear, ripens its own grain, twenty, thirty, or forty stems, and yet they {{are all the same}} plant, living with the life of that one <b>original</b> <b>seed.</b> So with Christ's Church--His body the Church. As soon as he rose, that new plant began to tiller. He did not keep His Spirit to Himself, but poured it out on the apostles, and from them it spread and spread--Each generation of Christians ripening, and bearing fruit, and dying, a fresh generation of fruit springing up from them, and so on, as we are now at this day. And yet all these plants, these millions and millions of Christian men and women, who have lived since Christ's blessed resurrection, all are parts of that one <b>original</b> <b>seed,</b> the body of Christ, whose members they are, and all owe their life to that one spirit of Christ, which is in them all and through them all, as the life of the original grain is in the whole crop which springs from it.|$|E

6000|$|His Japanese attendant, Asano, in expounding the {{political}} {{history of the}} intervening two centuries, drew an apt image from a seed eaten by insect parasites. First there is the <b>original</b> <b>seed,</b> ripening vigorously enough. And then comes some insect and lays an egg under the skin, and behold! {{in a little while}} the seed is a hollow shape with an active grub inside that has eaten out its substance. And then comes some secondary parasite, some ichneumon fly, and lays an egg within this grub, and behold! that, too, is a hollow shape, and the new living thing is inside its predecessor's skin which itself is snug within the seed coat. And the seed coat still keeps its shape, most people think it a seed still, and for all one knows it may still think itself a seed, vigorous and alive. [...] "Your Victorian kingdom," [...] said Asano, [...] "was like that--kingship with the heart eaten out. The landowners--the barons and gentry--began ages ago with King John; there were lapses, but they beheaded King Charles, and ended practically with King George mere husk of a king... the real {{power in the hands of}} their parliament. But the Parliament--the organ of the land-holding tenant-ruling gentry--did not keep its power long. The change had already come in the nineteenth century. The franchises had been broadened until it included masses of ignorant men, 'urban myriads,' who went in their featureless thousands to vote together. And the natural consequence of a swarming constituency is the rule of the party organisation. Power was passing even in the Victorian time to the party machinery, secret, complex, and corrupt. Very speedily power was in the hands of great men of business who financed the machines. A time came when the real power and interest of the Empire rested visibly between the two party councils, ruling by newspapers and electoral organisations--two small groups of rich and able men, working at first in opposition, then presently together." ...|$|E
