5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{worked closely}} with series star David Duchovny, who shares a story credit with Carter for the episode. Because the series was filmed in Vancouver, the {{producers}} painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1,600 gallons of red paint and also composited in images shot in New Mexico and a blue sky in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> New Mexico rock quarry featured in the episode.|$|E

Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety of picture sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, {{both of which were}} aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} shooter {{game in the}} Final Fantasy series, the game's staff had various {{problems}} during development, although producer Yoshinori Kitase found the experience challenging, and added role-playing elements in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game more entertaining for traditional fans of the main series. When Dirge of Cerberus was released outside Japan, several aspects of the gameplay were modified {{in order to make}} it more appealing. A mobile phone tie-in was also released in 2006, while in 2008, Square republished the game in Japan with the updates made for the Western versions. Although the game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011, it has received a mixed critical reaction.|$|E

This was changed in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game more competitive, {{and avoid the}} problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.|$|E

5|$|Cryptic Writings is {{the seventh}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on June 17, 1997 through Capitol Records, {{it was the}} band's last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His {{departure}} would {{mark the end of}} the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer Max Norman. The album features 12 tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.|$|E
5|$|In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> show {{seem more}} realistic, Franks and other writers {{talked to his}} father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down {{because it was too}} soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> character more appealing {{in the second part}} of the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E

Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{considered}} nominating him {{for vice}} president that year, calculating that his party loyalty and appeal to rural, agricultural and prohibitionist constituents, could balance a ticket headed by likely presidential nominee Al Smith, an urban anti-prohibitionist. When the Kentucky delegation arrived at the 1928 Democratic National Convention, they approached Smith supporters {{with a view to}} pairing Barkley to their candidate. They were received cordially, but Smith's advisors thought placing candidates with such differing views on the ticket would seem contrived to the electorate. They did not tell Barkley of their decision until after he seconded Smith's nomination for president. Smith then announced Arkansas Senator Joseph T. Robinson as his preferred running mate. The Kentuckians nominated Barkley in spite of Smith's preference, but the overwhelming majority of delegates voted for Robinson, and Barkley announced that Kentucky was changing its support in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1691, {{and a more}} refined one in 1716, he proposed that more accurate calculations could be made using measurements of a transit of Venus, although the next such event was not due until 1761. Halley died in 1742, but in 1761 numerous expeditions were made to {{various parts of the}} world so that precise observations of the transit could be made in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> calculations as described by Halley—an early example of international scientific collaboration. This collaboration was, however, underpinned by competition, the British, for example, being spurred to action only after they heard of French plans from Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. In an attempt to observe the first transit of the pair, astronomers from Britain, Austria and France traveled to destinations around the world, including Siberia, Newfoundland and Madagascar. Most managed to observe {{at least part of the}} transit, but successful observations were made in particular by Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason at the Cape of Good Hope. Less successful, at Saint Helena, were Nevil Maskelyne and Robert Waddington, although they put the voyage to good use by trialling the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.|$|E
