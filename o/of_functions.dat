5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space <b>of</b> <b>functions,</b> defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space <b>of</b> <b>functions,</b> and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> (originals) for which it can be effectively computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
