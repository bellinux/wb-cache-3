2500|$|<b>Organisers</b> must be determined, charismatic, {{and persuasive}} {{individuals}} able to sway groups to action under trying circumstances when jobs {{are on the}} line. <b>Organisers</b> must {{be strong enough to}} stand up to constant confrontation and must be willing to take big risks. Since failure rates of organizing campaigns are high, [...] "burn-out" [...] among <b>organisers</b> is prevalent. <b>Organisers</b> frequently work under the constraints of limited resources (see sections on organizing as cause and controversies).|$|R

25|$|In most unions, the <b>organiser's</b> role is {{to recruit}} groups of workers under the {{organizing}} model. In other unions, the <b>organiser's</b> role is largely that of servicing members and enforcing work rules, similar {{to the role of}} a shop steward.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{information distribution}} strategy {{is important for}} the success of an event, but is there a match between the information distributed by event <b>organisers</b> and the sources used by attendees? This paper integrates supply and demand-side perspectives on the information mix by presenting data from interviews with event managers and a survey of visitors at four events in Wellington, New Zealand. The information mix for events is characterised by the use of multiple channels by both <b>organisers</b> and visitors. There are gaps between the information channels identified as important by <b>organisers</b> and those used by attendees. The significance of previous experience and word of mouth were not fully recognised by <b>organisers,</b> whilst traditional print and broadcast media and the Internet were not utilised by visitors to the extent suggested in interviews with event <b>organisers.</b> Comparisons are also made between the information search behaviour of vat different events, and between local residents and tourists...|$|R
