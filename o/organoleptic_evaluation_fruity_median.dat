40|$|Introduction: Ingeneral, {{members of}} Cucurbitaceae are well {{exploited}} for their medicinal, economic and culinary values,however {{few of them}} are less exploited. The present study deals with pharamcognostical evaluation of one such plant namely Kedrostis foetidissima(Jacq.) Cogn. called as Appakovai in Tamil. Methods: Pharmacognostic evaluationswere carried out by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> anatomical studies and powder microscopy of leaves, roots and root tubers. Results: <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> revealed that the characteristic white tubers, as storag...|$|R
50|$|Some food packagers use <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations.</b> People {{use their}} senses (taste, smell, etc.) to {{determine}} if a package component has tainted the food in the package.|$|R
30|$|Again, this {{disagreement}} {{of sensory}} evaluation {{can be related}} to some borderline value in the chemical parameters. It {{is interesting to note that}} the only two samples, Ou 6 and Ou 8, judged EVOOs by the chemical analysis, with a slightly less FAEE content than the threshold value were classified as EVOOs or virgin olive oils by the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> A similar case is also represented by the sample Ou 1 which, through chemical analyses, was judged EVOO in three cases out of five with a borderline FAEE content, whereas, through <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> it was classified as EVOO, virgin olive oil or even lampante olive oil.|$|R
30|$|ICB data {{included}} {{chemical analyses}} namely free acidity, peroxide index, spectrophotometric UV evaluation, fatty acid ethyl esters and stigmadiens content and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{carried out by}} nine official International Olive Council labs according to EEC Regulation 2568 / 91.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, all the {{obtained}} results seem {{to suggest}} that only in the case of olive oils with extremely “good” chemical analyses, including a low FAEE content (neither borderline nor higher than the threshold value), the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> can be reproducible.|$|R
30|$|The {{sausages}} prepared using raw {{and partially}} cooked meats in four separate batches separately, were cooked for 15  min, {{so as to}} attain an internal temperature of 72  ±  1  °C, fried in a shallow pan, prior to <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a pilot {{analysis}} of data supplied by International Certificated Body, relative to 16 olive oils produced in the Mediterranean area, was carried out to verify reproducibility and consistency of chemical analyses and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> and therefore to highlight possible problems relative to quality grade classification. ICB data, including chemical analyses and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> were produced by nine official IOC labs according to EEC Regulation 2568 / 91. The recent scandals involving Italian olive oils, {{such as the one}} revealed in the ‘New York Times’ [7], prompted us to include data from olive oils purchased not only in Italy, the largest consumer of EVOOs, but also in non-Mediterranean countries such as USA.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{developing}} of nutrition formulations for various population groups categorized by gender, age, body type and nature of labor activity.

40|$|Cultured {{silver carp}} (Hypopthalmichthys molitrix 800 - 1000 g) was stored in ice (fish to ice ratio 1 : 1) in a plywood box {{insulated}} with one inch thick expanded polystyrene {{and subjected to}} detailed examination of quality by chemical, microbiological and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> at regular intervals to assess the storage life in good acceptable form. Alpha-amino nitrogen, non-protein nitrogen and pH values showed no positive correlation as spoilage index. Total volatile base nitrogen was not high {{at the end of}} the storage period although the fish became unacceptable during the period. There was steep decrease in total bacterial count during initial stages of storage and then increased steadily on further storage. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of raw and cooked meat revealed that fish was in good acceptable form up to 14 days in ice...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{official}} method (EEC Regulation 2568 / 91, Annex XII), in each IOC lab, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were carried out {{by a group of}} 8 – 12 professional tasters trained to recognize, describe and quantify basic taste and odour properties. Olive oils were described through positive (“fruity”, “bitter” and “pungent”) and negative (for instance “rancid”, “fusty”, “musty” and “winey”) attributes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTProximate composition, {{amino acid}} profile, trace minerals, {{functional}} properties and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of blends of unripe banana and pigeon pea flours were studied. The proximate {{composition of the}} blends showed that addition of pigeon pea significantly (p 0. 05) decreased.

30|$|The {{amount of}} fluids {{released}} during chewing {{of meat and}} meat products {{is an important factor}} in their <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The juiciness is reported to be directly related to the quantum of intra muscular fat (Marbling) and moisture content. Refrigerated storage of duck meat sausages for 14  days significantly (P <  0.01) decreased mean juiciness scores compared to fresh sausages, which is evident due to the loss of moisture during storage.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{chemical}} analyses, except the {{fatty acid ethyl ester}} content, obtained from the nine labs were consistent giving rise to the same quality grade. In nearly all samples, the fatty acid ethyl ester content was close to the threshold established for extra virgin olive oils indicating a non-excellent quality of the olive oils. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> commonly called panel test, given by the nine labs were not consistent.|$|R
40|$|Meat quality {{score and}} its {{composite}} traits of the Hungarian Large White pigs {{were analyzed using}} the national station test database {{for the period of}} 1994 - 2005. Th e distribution of the meat quality score was substantially diff erent from the normal distribution and the average score of the population was close to the possible maximum. Based on the results the traits can hardly be improved by selection. Analysing separately the composite parameters of the meat quality score (pH 1, pH 2, colour, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation)</b> the highest heritability estimates were estimated for meat colour and pH 2 (0. 38 ± 0. 01; 0. 35 ± 0. 01, respectively). Th e lowest heritability was estimated for the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> (0. 15 ± 0. 01), on the other hand this composite trait showed the highest genetic correlation with the meat quality score (0. 72 ± 0. 01), which is unfavourable. Based on the results the meat quality traits should be restricted to meat colour and pH 2. Key words pig, meat quality, genetic parameters, environmental factor...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{preparation}} and assessment of physico-chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties of pork nuggets was carried out using liquid whey {{as a replacement for}} added water at three different levels viz., 20, 30 and 40 %. Based on the physico-chemical and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> 20 % liquid whey as a water replacer was selected and shelf life studies was carried out. A significant (p< 0. 01) difference was evident in terms of pH, TBARS value, tyrosine value and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> during storage period. Also total viable count, staphylococcal count and yeast and mould count revealed a highly significant (p< 0. 01) difference during storage period. Further, the pork nuggets were well acceptable upto 14 days of storage at refrigerated temperature (4 ± 1 °C) by the panelists. By incorporating liquid whey in the comminuted meat products the most desirable quality pork nuggets can be developed with additional advantage of fortification, excluding the drying expenses to produce whey protein concentrates and elimination of environmental pollution due to draining of surplus liquid whey...|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{analyses}} and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{were carried out}} by nine recognized IOC laboratories, selected from the lists of IOC-recognized laboratories [8, 9], see Additional file 1 : Table S 1, located in countries with a well-recognized tradition {{in the production of}} olive oils such as Italy (5 labs in Abruzzo, Lazio, Liguria, Sicily and Veneto regions), Spain (2 labs), and Greece (1 lab). A Slovenian lab was also included as a reference for the Eastern countries.|$|R
40|$|Properties of {{soy protein}} {{hydrolysate}} produced by protease from biduri plant were studied. The soy protein hydrolysate had different properties due to various concentrations and hydrolysis times of protease from biduri. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the soy protein decreased {{significantly in the}} TBA value. This process increased the soluble protein content and promoted the Maillard reaction, resulting in a more brown color. Moreover, the soy protein hydrolysate had a higher value of â€˜umamiâ€™ taste by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|<b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{carried out}} from the {{different}} labs were extremely controversial. For instance, all the olive oils were judged as EVOOs according {{to the results of}} the Sicilian lab, whereas no sample was judged as EVOO according to the results of the Greek lab. These results clearly show that the same olive oil can be judged EVOO, virgin olive oil or lampante olive oil according to the the lab. This is the case of samples Oi 2, Oi 3, Oi 4, Oi 5, whereas samples Oi 1, Oi 6, Oi 7, Oi 8 were judged virgin olive oils or EVOOs. Only sample Oi 6 was judged EVOO according to the results of all the labs except the Greek one. It {{is important to note that}} this olive oil has a FAEE concentration < 15  mg/kg well below the threshold of 35  mg/kg, whereas the other olive oils exhibit a FAEE content which is slightly less or higher than the threshold value. The strict connection between FAEE content and the positive attributes by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of an olive oil has been previously reported [10, 14].|$|R
40|$|Many {{objective}} {{chemical tests}} {{have attempted to}} correlate with <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of oxidative rancidity. Major chemical tests used to detect oxidative rancidity of lipids measure nonvolatile high molecular weight carbonylic substances which make no considerable contribution to rancid flavors. High molecular weight carbonyls are present at much greater concentrations than volatile low molecular weight carbonyls. Peroxides and other unknown substances also react in these chemical tests to give at best an empirical evaluation. A 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone chemical test is proposed which corrected some deficiencies of earlier procedures, and was correlated with <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of rancid turkey samples. The proposed test measures oxidative rancidity in terms of milligrams of acetaldehyde per kilogram of sample. A comparison of the 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone method with a widely used chemical test was conducted. The thiobarbituric acid test was selected because it is used most often {{as an indicator of}} rancidity. The thiobarbituric acid test values increased followed by a definite leveling off as formation of malonaldehyde reached a maximum even though rancid flavor continued to increase. The 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone test measured a continuing increase of volatile aliphatic aldehydes as rancid flavor increased...|$|R
40|$|Unripe {{jackfruit}} is one vegetables that  {{is usually}} processed into Indonesian dishs. Beside unripe jackfruit processed into vegetables {{can also be}} developed and processed into a dry product called beef floss. Unripe jackfruit has a very low protein content, so it needs other raw material to improve protein content of the floss we added tempeh to the floss = gembus tempeh or soybean tempeh, as much as 15 %, 25 %, 35 % and 0 % as control. This study uses a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 2 factors. The first factor is proportion of unripe jackfruit and tempeh, and the second factor is type of tempeh. Parameter of this research are <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the color, moisture content and protein content. The result of <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> is the proportion 25 % soybean tempeh prefered for aroma, taste, color, texture. The highest L (Lightness) was resulted from 35 % soybean tempeh. The highest moisture content was shown by floss with 15 % soybean tempeh. Protein content increased from 4, 3775 % to 39, 3975 % by addition of soybean tempeh while protein increased from 4, 3775 %  to 14, 8835 % in beef floss added with gembus  tempeh...|$|R
30|$|In our opinion, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> is {{extremely}} important for a global picture of the sensory properties of olive oil and it is particularly precious and not replaceable with other analysis to give add values to PDO or other peculiar EVOOs. On the other hand, this analysis seems to be not enough reproducible {{in the case of}} common commercial EVOOs probably due to different sensory sensibility in the different IOC panel labs and therefore it is not suitable for a legally accepted official evaluation.|$|R

40|$|Physicochemical and {{organoleptic}} properties of tempeh hydrolysate produced by protease were studied. The tempeh hydrolysate had different properties comparing {{with those of}} the unhydrolyzed tempeh powder. Hydrolysis of the tempeh protein could lower the antioxidant activity. Accordingly, the TBA value increased significantly when the tempeh was hydrolyzed by protease. This process also promoted Maillard reaction, resulting in a more brown color than that of the unhydrolyzed tempeh powder. Moreover, the tempeh hydrolysate had a better protein solubility, and a higher index of umami taste by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{inability}} of some parents {{to afford the}} commercial weaning foods {{has led to an}} increase in case of malnutrition. This is predominant in babies that have reached the weaning stage. This work focused on the utilization of plantain (Musa spp., ABB genome) flour for enhancing the nutritive value of Sorghum-Ogi food, {{which is one of the}} stable foods used as weaning food in Nigeria. The study was carried out using the same quantity of Sorghum-Ogi (100 %) with increasing quantity of plantain flour (20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % weight per weight). The proximate analysis, functional properties, pasting properties, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> and microbial load of the food blends were determined. The result indicated that there was an increase in fat content with increased addition of plantain flour. The microbial load of the blend indicated that the food blends were safe for consumption. The inclusion of plantain showed a high acceptance value up to 60 % plantain flour for the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In summary, the nutritional indices analyzed indicated that increasing level of addition of plantain flour up to 60 % level is an optimum and good nutritional weaning food for babies and this will solve food security issues in children...|$|R

30|$|Our data {{analysis}} underlines {{that it is}} crucial to find out what causes the variability of judgement in the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Sensory panel test seems to work well in the case of extremely good olive oils, whereas in the case of common commercial EVOOs can give discordant results. A different sensory sensibility seems to be present in the different IOC panel labs, especially in case of EVOOs characterized by a FAEE content very close to the threshold. For a given olive oil, the question to be or not to be classified as EVOO becomes a question strictly linked to the lab.|$|R
