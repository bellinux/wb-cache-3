The Schafer family was among the early settlers, having moved to the region from Wisconsin. Three of the Schafer brothers, sons of the {{pioneering}} family, founded {{one of the biggest}} and most successful logging companies of the area.

It was the great war path of the Iroquois Indians that crossed the river at Canawaugus and went {{directly}} to [...] "Big Springs" [...] and on to Tonawanda. In 1798, Williamson had this path improved to some extent. The improvement consisted of widening it slightly and filling in some of the holes and bogs so that an <b>oxteam</b> could manage to get through.|$|E
