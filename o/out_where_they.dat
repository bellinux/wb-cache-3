5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} dating the poems is {{linked with the}} problem of finding <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were composed. Iceland was not settled until about 870, so {{anything}} composed before that time would necessarily have been elsewhere, most likely in Scandinavia. Any young poems, on the other hand, are likely Icelandic in origin.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are empty except for titles at the top of each page. The titles {{themselves}} are named after all the locations that can be visited throughout the game world, and as such players can use this to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> have to go to next. As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
25|$|Having evaded Edward's fleet, {{which had}} been sent to {{intercept}} them, Isabella and Mortimer landed at Orwell on the east coast of England on 24 September with a small force; estimates of Isabella's army vary from between 300 and around 2,000 soldiers, with 1,500 being a popular middle figure. After a short period of confusion during which they attempted to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> had actually landed, Isabella moved quickly inland, dressed in her widow's clothes. The local levies mobilised to stop them immediately changed sides, and by the following day Isabella was in Bury St Edmunds and shortly afterwards had swept inland to Cambridge. Thomas, Earl of Norfolk, joined Isabella's forces and Henry of Lancaster– the brother of the late Thomas, and Isabella's uncle– also announced he was joining Isabella's faction, marching south to join her.|$|E
30|$|A {{fundamental}} decision being {{faced by}} India {{and other countries}} at similar levels of development (India is now classified as a lower-middle income country, a group which also includes Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, among others) is whether to try to use scarce development resources {{to help the poor}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are or to help get them <b>out</b> of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are. If India were to try to help the poor get <b>out</b> of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are, they could try to improve employment conditions by directly employing the poor in public sector jobs or by stimulating private sector firms to employ more workers or to employ non-wage workers in the public sector. To create wage jobs for even a fraction of India’s self-employed would require massive expenditures, far exceeding the nation’s means.|$|R

25|$|Harold Bishop {{visits and}} admits to having {{reservations}} about Amber and the wedding, causing Daniel to rescind his invitation. Paul also tries to stop Daniel from getting married by inviting Des Clarke (Paul Keane) {{to talk to}} him about his failed first wedding. On the day of the wedding, Daniel tries to persuade Imogen to attend, but she admits that she is in love with him. Daniel learns the whereabouts of Agnes Robinson's ring and Imogen goes with him to retrieve it from an old well. They become trapped in the well after the ladder breaks, causing Daniel to miss the wedding. The situation in the well grows worse when Imogen's asthma makes it hard for her to breathe and water is pumped in. Josh manages to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are, leading to their rescue. Amber and Daniel reunite, and Amber learns she is pregnant. Amber admits that she had a one-night stand with Josh and a DNA test shows he is the father. Daniel tries to support Amber financially and sells some of his Off Air shares to Karl Kennedy. He and Amber later break-up.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the first Survivor Series was the first Survivor Series {{elimination}} match. Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake, and Jim Duggan faced WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass, and Harley Race. Savage's team was seconded by his wife Miss Elizabeth while Honky's team was seconded by Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart. Beefcake and Hercules started off before Duggan and Race were tagged in. Duggan knocked Race {{out of the ring}} and followed him <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> brawled and both men were counted out and eliminated, leaving four men on each team. Beefcake hit a high knee on Bass, and went on to eliminate him. Team captain Honky himself joined the match and hit his Shake, Rattle and Roll on Beefcake and eliminated him, evening the match at three all. Roberts hit a DDT on Davis and only two men remained in Honky's team, Honky and Hercules. Savage hit the Savage Elbow on Hercules and pinned him, leaving Honky the only member in his team. After being dominated by Savage, Roberts and Steamboat for a couple of minutes, Honky was atomic dropped over the top rope by Savage and ran from the ring with Jimmy Hart and his IC Belt and was counted out. Honky's self-elimination made Savage, Roberts and Steamboat the survivors of the match.|$|E

500|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the nature of}} the ship's intended secondary battery. According to Gardiner and Gray, the battery was to consist of twelve [...] /50 caliber guns, also manufactured by Bethlehem, mounted in casemates amidships, six on either side. These guns fired [...] projectiles at a at a muzzle velocity of 2,800f/s (853m/s). According to Norman Friedman, these twelve guns were sold to Britain after the war broke <b>out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were used to fortify the Grand Fleet's main base at Scapa Flow. But Antony Preston disagrees, stating that the guns were to have been [...] guns ordered from the Coventry Ordnance Works. Salamiss armament was rounded out by twelve [...] quick-firing guns, also mounted in casemates, and five [...] submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E
500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were living, and she would find them camping out in the hallway, and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E

2500|$|David and Jennie Curry, {{owners and}} {{operators}} of Curry Village, were schoolteachers {{who arrived in}} Yosemite Valley in 1899. The couple offset some of their vacation costs by giving camping tours, having experimented early on in Yellowstone National Park. For three summers in a row, the Currys led teachers on camping outings to Yellowstone with horse and wagon; arriving in Yosemite with a cook and seven tents. Despite the two-week, round trip travel period from Merced, California, the camp registered 292 guests its first year. The couple brought their three children with them. Foster, Mary and Marjorie (ages four through eleven) all helped <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were able. The Curry Company came to dominate {{the politics of the}} park for decades. David wrote the Secretary of the Interior, Franklin Lane, in an effort extend the park's tourist season, hoping to expand his business. The Currys were adept at promotion and revived an old tradition started by James McCauley on the Fourth of July 1872. At sunset, piles of burning logs were pushed off Glacier Point creating what was known as the Fire Fall. The theory was, national parks were for recreational use. David Curry died in 1917 and left the management of Camp Curry to his widow Jennie, now known as [...] "Mother Curry".
