5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dramatic</b> potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E

5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 191 brought strong {{criticism}} from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design. The DC-10 {{had been involved in}} two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, American Airlines Flight 96 (1972) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (1974). The separation of engine one from its mount, the widespread publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dramatic</b> images of the airplane missing its engine seconds before the crash, and a second photo of the fireball resulting from the impact, raised widespread concerns about the safety of the DC-10. The final blow to the airplane's reputation was dealt two weeks after the crash, when the aircraft was grounded by the FAA. Although the aircraft itself was later exonerated, the damage in the public's eye was already done.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} in Lima {{with a new}} generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dramatic</b> Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, bulimia, gender identity, child molestation, dyslexia, school violence, and pregnancy scares. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was promoted to the main cast.|$|E

The work also shows some influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dramatic</b> sensibilities of Meyerbeer.|$|E
