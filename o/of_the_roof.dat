5|$|Arriving at the capitol, I {{sprang from}} my horse, first unbuckling {{the stars and}} stripes, a large flag I had {{on the front of}} my saddle. With Captain Langdon, chief of artillery, I rushed up to the roof. Together we hoisted the first large flag over Richmond, and on the peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> drank to its success.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} fan vaulting ceiling, originally {{installed by}} Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hole in {{the roof}} for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry. The interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> has putlog holes rather than nesting boxes but {{may also have been}} used by pigeons.|$|E

5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, {{as well as a}} defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang off the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E

One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a lofted shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the press box and clipped the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, wind gusts reached 110mph (170km/h) on Grand Bahama. Bermuda {{was also}} {{impacted}} by the hurricane, with strong winds blowing roofs off buildings, including a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> on the House of Assembly of Bermuda, and the sides of some structures were knocked down. Electrical light wires and telephone lines were down across the island. Kindley Air Force Base and the U.S. Naval Base received minimal damage. Damages exceeded $1million.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} pineapple. Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton {{as a symbol of}} welcome, an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached the city {{as a result of the}} slave trade in the 16th century. The pineapple survived the bombing and has been used as an exhibited on special occasions, such as Black History Month.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{distinctive}} in {{its large}} skull with broad, well-developed incisors {{and a strong}} front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved downwards. In O.albiventer, the rostrum and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger. The interparietal bone, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the braincase, was broad and the incisive foramina, which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars, were relatively short.|$|E

On the roof of the passenger shelter is a wind vane designed by artist Miles Pepper.

5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and the width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs. Moving walkways and electric carts were both considered and rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station to the terminal by installing windscreens and adding a cart shuttle service.|$|E
