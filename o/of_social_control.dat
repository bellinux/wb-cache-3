5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control</b> within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
40|$|Studies had {{suggested}} that informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> is key to understanding neighborhood crime rates. Yet {{little is known about}} sources <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> in urban neighborhoods, and less is known about the role of neighborhood attachment in fostering informal <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> To fill this gap, this study addressed three questions: (1) Does neighborhood attachment, operationalized as a multidimensional construct, contribute to neighborhood levels <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control?</b> (2) Does neighborhood attachment help explain the lower levels <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> typically observed in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods? (3) If so, what dimensions of neighborhood attachment are most important and how? Using multilevel data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) results indicated that systemic ties and attitudinal attachment were positively associated with neighborhood levels <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control,</b> and that these dimensions of neighborhood attachment explained some of the associations between neighborhood structural conditions and informal <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Hate {{crimes are}} {{informal}} <b>social</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms utilized in stratified societies to police relative identity boundaries (Perry, 2009). No research has, however, located racially-motivated hate crimes {{as a form}} <b>of</b> racialized <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> Considering {{the long history of}} racial violence and racialized <b>social</b> <b>control</b> in the United States, the war on drugs, the post- 9 / 11 socio-political context, immigration reforms, and increased attention to racialized police violence, it becomes important to explore the spectrum <b>of</b> racialized <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> In order to do so, this study introduces racially-motivated hate crimes as an informal mechanism <b>of</b> racialized <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> As such, this study engages an explorative and comparative analysis of reported racially-motivated hate crime rates, correctional supervision rates, and immigration enforcement rates in the United Stated of America. The findings capture the continued anti-Black racism, the complicated racialization and criminalization of Latinos, and a drastic intensification in the <b>social</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Muslims, ‘Muslim-looking’ Arabs, and Middle Easterners post 9 / 11. The mirroring of hate crime trends against patterns of correctional supervision and immigration enforcement illustrates the broad spectrum <b>of</b> racialized <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> Specifically, racially-motivated hate crimes are an informal mechanism <b>of</b> racialized <b>social</b> <b>control</b> that supplements formal and semi-formal control mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control</b> throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E

This article based on ethnographic research describes a London housing estate that had statistically higher than average rates of crime and many of the 'design failures' of public housing. ret crime was not perceived to be a 'problem' by the residents who lived there. The description suggests that particular features of the estate including its resident and demographic profile, geographic location, and the presence of some degree <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> enabled tenants to contain crime. The article concludes that the role <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> in high crime areas and the relationship between crime and public housing is more problematic than many commentators have suggested...|$|R

25|$|The {{significant}} {{influence of the}} Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked.

25|$|Foucault's {{theories}} primarily {{address the}} relationship between power and knowledge, {{and how they are}} used as a form <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control</b> through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of modernity.

25|$|The inquisition put {{to death}} many of the New Christians, and expropriated the {{property}} and wealth of many others. The riches of even some Old Christian merchants were expropriated after false anonymous complaints were made that the inquisitors accepted as valid, since {{the property of the}} condemned reverted to themselves. On the other hand, few merchants would not have had some New Christian ancestry, as marriages between the children of Christian and Jewish partners in the major firms were commonplace. The Inquisition thus became an instrument <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control</b> {{in the hands of the}} Old Christians against almost all the Lisbon merchants, and finally restored their long lost supremacy.|$|E
25|$|Analyzing {{aggression}} culturally or politically {{is complicated}} by the fact that the label 'aggressive' can itself be used as a way of asserting a judgement from a particular point of view. Whether a coercive or violent method <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control</b> is perceived as aggression– or as legitimate versus illegitimate aggression– depends on the position of the relevant parties in relation to the social order of their culture. This in turn can relate to factors such as: norms for coordinating actions and dividing resources; what is considered self-defense or provocation; attitudes towards 'outsiders', attitudes towards specific groups such as women, the disabled or the lower status; the availability of alternative conflict resolution strategies; trade interdependence and collective security pacts; fears and impulses; and ultimate goals regarding material and social outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Social {{disorganization}} {{states that}} neighborhood social ties and shared expectations for informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> {{are necessary for}} the exercise <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions. Yet this association is largely assumed rather than empirically examined in the literature. This paper examines the relationship between neighborhood social ties, shared expectations for informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> and actual parochial and public informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions taken by residents in response to big neighborhood problems. Methods: Using multi-level logistic regression models, we integrate Australian Bureau of Statistics census data with the Australian Community Capacity Study survey data of 1310 residents reporting 2614 significant neighborhood problems across 148 neighborhoods to examine specific informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions taken by residents when faced with neighborhood problems. Results: We do not find a relationship between shared expectations for informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> and residents’ informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions. Individual <b>social</b> ties, however, do {{lead to an increase}} in informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions in response to ‘big’ neighborhood problems. Residents with strong ties are {{more likely to engage in}} public and parochial informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions than those individuals who lack social ties. Yet individuals living in neighborhoods with high levels <b>of</b> <b>social</b> ties are only moderately more likely to engage in parochial informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> action than those living in areas where these ties are not present. Shared expectations for informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> are not associated with the likelihood that residents engage in informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions when faced with a significant neighborhood problem. Conclusion: Neighborhood social ties and shared expectations for informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> are not unilaterally necessary for the exercise <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control</b> actions. Our results challenge contemporary articulations <b>of</b> <b>social</b> disorganization theory that assume that the availability <b>of</b> neighborhood <b>social</b> ties or expectations for action are associated with residents actually doing something to exercise <b>of</b> informal <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{concepts}} <b>of</b> science and <b>social</b> <b>control</b> to be found within interwar institutional economics. It is argued that these were central parts of the institutionalist approach to economics as the key participants in the movement defined it. For institutionalists, science was defined as empirical, investigational, experimental, and instrumental. <b>Social</b> <b>control</b> was {{defined in terms of}} the development of new instruments for the control of business to supplement the market mechanism. The concepts <b>of</b> science and <b>social</b> <b>control</b> were joined via John Dewey’s pragmatic and instrumental philosophy. These ideas provided important links to the ideals of foundations, such as Rockefeller, and thus to access to research funding. Institutionalist concepts <b>of</b> science and <b>social</b> <b>control</b> were, however, displaced after World War II by Keynesian policy and positivist ideas of scientific methodology.
