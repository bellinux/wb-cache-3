5|$|Manchester Liners decided {{from the}} <b>outset</b> to make Manchester–Canada their prime route, with a {{secondary}} {{route to the}} southern United States cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Other lesser, sometimes seasonal routes, were added later.|$|E
5|$|This {{multiplication}} {{of effects}} {{at the very}} <b>outset</b> of the play served as a shock and foretaste of what the audience would find farther along.|$|E
5|$|A {{site for}} a church had been set aside on the estate from the <b>outset,</b> and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E
5|$|All {{houses were}} built with marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues. All houses were supplied with running water supplied from the New River, which flowed through nearby Wood Green. However, not all houses were supplied with gas or mains electricity from the <b>outset,</b> the remainder being lit by candles or oil or paraffin lamps.|$|E
5|$|All new MRT lines built {{since the}} North East Line in 2003 are {{equipped}} with moving block CBTC from the <b>outset,</b> and {{have the capability to}} be completely driverless and automated, require no onboard staffing. Operations are monitored remotely from the operations control centre of the respective lines. Trains {{are equipped with}} intercoms to allow passengers to communicate with staff in emergencies.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the war, Frederick {{had one of}} {{the finest}} armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the <b>outset</b> more of a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>outset</b> of the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed {{down to a}} more {{manageable}} eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the <b>outset</b> was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>outset,</b> {{the fate}} of the pier has been intimately linked with the central {{reclamation}} project which was unveiled in 1989 but not explicitly spelled out as such. However, the scale of reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X2 {{features}} twenty-three playable characters; {{twenty of}} them are available from <b>outset,</b> with Justice, Kliff Undersn, and Robo-Ky as unlockable secret characters. In addition to the return of all Guilty Gear Xs roster—Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, Johnny, May, Chipp Zanuff, Potemkin, Baiken, Axl Low, Faust, Anji Mito, Jam Kuradoberi, Dizzy, Testament, Zato-1, Millia Rage, Venom—, there are four new characters: Bridget, Zappa, Slayer, and the aforementioned I-No.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton and Jefferson had the {{greatest}} impact on cabinet deliberations during Washington's first term. Their deep philosophical differences set them against each other from the <b>outset,</b> and they frequently sparred over economic and foreign policy issues. With Jefferson's departure, Hamilton came to dominate the cabinet, and Washington continued to turn to him for advice even after Hamilton resigned from the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination at the <b>outset</b> of the Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers {{in the western part of}} the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the band}} listened to {{hundreds}} of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them. Harris' preferred choice from the <b>outset,</b> Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1890, {{the bridge}} was officially opened by future Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, then {{chairman}} of the newly formed London County Council. Unlike its predecessor, the new bridge was officially named Battersea Bridge. Although the road was narrow, trams operated on it from the <b>outset.</b> Initially these were horse-drawn, but from 22 June 1911 the electric trams of London County Council Tramways were introduced.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded at the <b>outset</b> of {{the voyage}} {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the <b>outset</b> of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Dundee Hibernian in 1909, playing from the <b>outset</b> at Tannadice Park. They were voted into the Scottish Football League in 1910. After being saved from {{going out of}} {{business}} in October 1923, the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} that the Paris Accord that ended the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the <b>outset,</b> in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the cease-fire.|$|E
5|$|The post-war period {{witnessed}} both {{expansion and}} the commissioning of new products. The company always ensured its products {{were covered by}} patent and trade mark, a policy prosecuted with vigour from the <b>outset.</b> The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export {{side of the business}} move to Notting Hill Gate, close to the pipe and cigarette division located at Campden Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|After her World War I service ended, Siboney was {{returned}} to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at Vigo, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe at the <b>outset</b> of World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At the <b>outset</b> of the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the <b>outset</b> of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the <b>outset,</b> there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the Korean War, Leyte {{was ordered}} to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds {{despite the efforts of}} wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu {{wrote the}} {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), {{which made him}} well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the}} most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the Second World War, {{due to the}} {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> of the war, Australia's {{economy had}} been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed {{it was estimated that}} after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} <b>outset</b> of his reign, Alexios {{had to meet}} the {{formidable}} threat of the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans, yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field. Alexios himself was wounded, but the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085 led to the Norman danger receding for a time.|$|E
5|$|At the war's <b>outset,</b> FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the <b>outset,</b> forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|Born in Portland, Maine, Loring {{joined the}} U.S. Army in 1942 and was quickly {{selected}} to undergo pilot training. He spent several months stationed in Puerto Rico before being transferred to {{duty in the}} United Kingdom in 1944. There, he flew 55 combat missions in P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft before being shot down and serving six months as a Nazi German prisoner of war. By the <b>outset</b> of the Korean War, Loring was working in an administrative role in the United States, but by 1952 had been transferred to combat duty in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the <b>outset,</b> he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|Chester Alan Arthur (October5, 1829– November18, 1886) was an American {{attorney}} and politician {{who served as}} the 21st President of the United States from 1881 to 1885; he succeeded James A. Garfield upon the latter's assassination. At the <b>outset,</b> Arthur struggled to overcome a slightly negative reputation, which stemmed from his early career in politics as part of New York's Republican political machine. He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform. His advocacy for, and subsequent enforcement of, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner began {{development}} after the positive reception of Shin Megami Tensei If.... Designed from the <b>outset</b> as a spin-off {{from the main}} Megami Tensei series, it drew on elements of detective fiction. It was also the series' first appearance on fifth-generation home consoles. Regular Megami Tensei staff were involved with the project, including director Kouji Okada, writer Ryutaro Ito, and character designer Kazuma Kaneko. The music was composed by Toshiko Tasaki and Tsukasa Masuko. Upon its release in Japan, the original version garnered positive reviews from Japanese press and strong sales. It went on to spawn both a television series and multiple sequels.|$|E
