25|$|Timing is {{important}} to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound reepithelialization can decide the outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing.</b> If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.|$|E

25|$|In Golestan and Khorasan in Iran as in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, {{the word}} bakhshi means instrumentalist, singer, and storyteller. The word bakhshi comes from Turkish, {{and in turn}} from a Chinese word, po-shih, meaning erudite. Through the Turkish Ouigours, certain Chinese {{language}} elements infiltrated 13th and 14th-century Mongol literature. The word bakhshi appeared in Turkmen, Iranian and Turkish literature {{with the advent of}} the Mongols. At the time, the role of the bakhshi seems to have been sometimes that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> shaman, and at other times that of a Buddhist priest.|$|E
25|$|A scar {{is an area}} of fibrous {{tissue that}} replaces normal skin after an injury. Scars result from the {{biological}} process of wound repair in the skin, as well as in other organs and tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g., after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete regeneration, which regrow tissue without scar formation.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> {{cracks in}} concrete is inevitable {{due to its}} limited tensile strength. Up to now, several approaches {{have been used to}} design concrete with self-healing properties. Depending on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> damage, different healing agents can be used. In case of dynamic cracks in structures exposed to cyclic loads, elastic healing materials can be used to cope with the crack opening and closing movement. In this study, we aimed at determining the most suitable polymer backbone to be applied for <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> dynamic cracks. For this purpose, different polymeric precursors including siloxane- (PDMS), polypropylene glycol/urethane- (PPG), epoxy- and polyester-based (PE) have been evaluated. <b>The</b> <b>healing</b> capacity was evaluated by determining the regain in water tightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> cracks using water flow tests. <b>The</b> strain capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymers was assessed after widening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> cracks in a stepwise fashion. Comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sealing properties before and after each stepwise elongation shows that a strain of at least 50 % could be achieved for epoxy and PDMS-based healing agents. For polyester and PPG-based precursors failure occurred due to polymer detachment. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> high alkalinity on <b>the</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymerized <b>healing</b> agents has been also evaluated with the PPG-based precursor showing the best performance in terms of degradation. and PE the highest mass loss percentage after incubation in concrete pore solution...|$|R

When bilo or salamanga healing rituals are being conducted, the ombiasy may erect a special barrier (kiady) in front of the entrance to the house where the ceremony is being held as an indicator that anyone whose family member has recently died (as well as any foreigner or stranger outside the community) is forbidden to enter for concern about breaking the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> spell.|$|E

25|$|Deep or {{superficial}} wound infection has {{an approximate}} incidence of 2%. It {{is a serious}} problem as superficial infection may lead to deep infection. This may cause infection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> bone and contamination of the implants. It is difficult to eliminate infection in the presence of metal foreign bodies such as implants. Bacteria inside the implants are inaccessible to the body's defence system and to antibiotics. The management is to attempt to suppress the infection with drainage and antibiotics until the bone is healed. Then the implant should be removed, following which the infection may clear up.|$|E

25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{may include}} formalized aspects of folk medicine, {{that is to}} say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience. Folk medicine may also be referred to as traditional medicine, alternative medicine, indigenous medicine, or natural medicine. These terms are often considered interchangeable, even though some authors may prefer one or the other because of certain overtones they may be willing to highlight. In fact, out of these terms perhaps only indigenous medicine and traditional medicine have the same meaning as folk medicine, while the others should be understood rather in a modern or modernized context.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty develop approximately at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week post-operative. Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) {{usually have a}} longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> of the incisions to the chest muscles. Usually, she does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial post-operative recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, analgesic indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support brassières, or narcotic pain medication.|$|E
