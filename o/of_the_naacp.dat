50|$|Historian Patricia Bernstein {{has argued}} that Mitchell's {{protection}} from lynching and legal execution, while judicially flawed, demonstrated <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP's</b> anti-lynching campaign.|$|R
50|$|Around {{this time}} {{it is noted that}} in 1915 he was {{captured}} in the “Education Number” special <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP’s</b> <b>The</b> Crisis, and also met Booker T.

50|$|Houston is {{also well}} known for having trained and mentored a {{generation}} of black attorneys, including Thurgood Marshall, future director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP's</b> Legal Defense Fund and appointed as Supreme Court Justice.

5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP</b> and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E

5|$|Higginbotham {{transferred}} to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1945. On {{the day that}} Higginbotham entered Antioch, one other black student was also admitted, Coretta Scott, who would later become Coretta Scott King after marrying Martin Luther King Jr.. At Antioch, Higginbotham served {{as the head of}} the college chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP.</b> During a conference of Ohio State collegiate NAACP chapters, Higginbotham successfully advocated for legislation to lower the voting age to 18. Higginbotham earned his B.A. in 1949.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Arthur B.

Prior to that he had been active in Omaha civil rights and was an assessor and on the tax appraisal board of Douglas County. In 1955 he was Nebraska state chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP</b> and helped form a Lincoln chapter of the organization.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Higginbotham {{went into}} private {{practice}} {{as a member of}} the first African American law firm in Philadelphia, Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, and Higginbotham. In addition to Higginbotham, three of the other named partners went on to become judges; Harvey Schmidt and Doris Harris would later serve as judges on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and Clifford Scott Green was appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Higginbotham stayed in private practice until 1962. While at the firm, Higginbotham practiced criminal defense and personal injury law. From 1960 to 1962 he was President of the Philadelphia chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jerry McAfee {{served as}} {{president}} of the Minneapolis chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP</b> until 2015, at which point Levy-Pounds decided to run. She won the election unopposed on the ballot but faced criticism from McAfee who contended that she was too focused on issues of police brutality to the neglect of concerns such as crime perpetrated against African Americans by African Americans. Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has been critical of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E
50|$|Approximately a week later, <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> three {{unidentified}} {{black men}} {{were taken from}} the Little River, below Barney. It was not clear if they were new or old victims.

50|$|Cornelius Marion Battey (August 26, 1873 - March 14, 1927) was an African-American {{photographer}} who shot photographic portraits of black Americans in a pictorialist style. His photograph of black leaders appeared on <b>the</b> cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP's</b> magazine <b>The</b> Crisis {{beginning in the}} 1910s. He later founded and headed up the photography department at the Tuskegee Institute.|$|R
50|$|Gibson was a {{graduate}} of North Carolina A&T State University and Meharry Medical College. He served as president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP's</b> regional branch in Greenville, South Carolina before succeeding Margaret Bush Wilson as national chairperson. As chair, he encouraged voter registration and worked to increase economic opportunities for African Americans. However, his handling of finances was controversial, and <b>the</b> <b>NAACP</b> found itself with a $4 million deficit in 1995. That year, NAACP board members voted 30-29 to replace Gibson with Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of Medgar Evers.|$|R
5|$|Other black {{newspapers}} {{also carried}} significant {{coverage of the}} lynching, as did liberal papers such as The New Republic and The Nation. Freeman traveled around the U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation, maintaining that a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions. Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre. Leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP</b> hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP,</b> pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years of}} the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E
5|$|Willkie warned Republicans {{that only}} a full {{commitment}} to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1942, {{one of the most}} prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring racial issues. When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board of Twentieth-Century Fox. In 1943, he worked with Walter White, executive secretary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NAACP,</b> to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie's death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.|$|E
