50|$|However, {{because of}} its general {{resistance}} to corrosion, aluminium {{is one of the}} few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component <b>of</b> silver-colored <b>paints.</b> <b>Aluminium</b> mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200-400 nm (UV) and the 3,000-10,000 nm (far IR) regions; in the 400-700 nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the 700-3000 nm (near IR) by silver, gold, and copper.|$|R

50|$|For the Material Witness {{exhibition}} at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen <b>of</b> his <b>painted</b> <b>aluminium</b> extrusions. Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another, the display articulated Butcher’s increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, ‘installation’ {{in creating a}} total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object. As Kenneth Baker, in his San Francisco Chronicle review, wrote of the work’s interaction with the space it occupied, ‘to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole’. This can also be said of Butcher’s curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself, he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, Marc Vaux and Cathy Wade, {{as well as his}} own. Butcher’s attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, ‘engage the space around the painted surface’ were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, ‘each of the artists… employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically’.|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{filiform}} corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> powder <b>painted</b> <b>aluminium</b> profiles was studied, and the coating barrier properties together with adhesion to the substrate were analysed. Samples {{coated with a}} traditional painting procedure (one powder layer application followed by curing), and other samples coated using a special cycle to obtain wood grain effect were compared using accelerated {{filiform corrosion}} tests. Moreover, {{in order to better}} understand the degradation mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>painted</b> metal substrates, thermal stresses were applied to accelerate the natural weathering. The effects of the thermal aging were analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Wood grain effect coatings showed to better resist, with respect to a traditional coating, to filiform corrosion when testing was performed following the DIN 65472 standard. On the contrary, electrochemical impedance measurements showed better barrier properties against water uptake for the traditional coating after thermal ageing. Different barrier properties were found to depend on the microstructure of the two coatings after curing. The traditional one has a homogeneous microstructure, with completely fused powder grains and very fine size pigments. On the contrary, wood grain effect coating possesses a "defective" microstructure with a widespread distribution of partially fused powders grains determining a dense network of grain boundaries, moreover coarser size pigments are present. This microstructure decreases the coating barrier properties, but also can determine a loss of plasticity and the coating under mechanical stress can crack modifying the filiform corrosion behaviour...|$|R

When the cylinders are eccentric, transition from laminar to turbulent flow is obscrved to proceed in four stages, an additional instability being present when comparcd with the concentric cylinder case.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to assess the feasibility of dry ice blasting {{as a replacement for}} solvent cleaning for the removal of organic layers from metal cultural heritage objects. The effects of dry ice blasting on test samples of aluminium, bronze and weathering steel were studied along with its effectiveness at removing organic layers from four objects. Metal surfaces were studied in detail before and after cleaning using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was possible to remove wax layers from most of the metal samples. The removal <b>of</b> spray <b>paint</b> from <b>aluminium</b> was very successful, however, its removal from weathering steel proved very difficult. The gradual removal of patina/corrosion from weathering steel and bronze was possible without damaging the substrate. Results indicate that dry ice blasting is a good alternative to other air abrasive methods, such as sandblasting or walnut shell blasting...|$|R

40|$|Auto-makers plan a broad {{shift from}} steel to {{aluminium}} uses {{over the next}} decade.

40|$|The {{effects of}} four substrates-an {{aluminium}} board, a plasterboard, a gypsum board and a plywood board-on {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) emissions from an interior finishing varnish were investigated using a dynamic environmental chamber. Four major VOCs, including toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene, were identified in the varnish emissions. The average amount of VOCs emitted from the <b>painted</b> <b>aluminium</b> substrate was approximately 65 % more than that from the painted plywood substrate during the 10 h test period.

5000|$|Panel edge {{staining}} is {{a naturally}} occurring problem that occurs to anodized aluminium {{and stainless steel}} paneling and facades.

Panel edge staining may also appear on powder coated <b>aluminium,</b> <b>painted</b> <b>aluminium,</b> stainless steel and titanium surfaces.|$|R
