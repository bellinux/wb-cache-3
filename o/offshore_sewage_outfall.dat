40|$|Thesis (M. Dip.) [...] Cape Technikon, 1990 The die-off in {{the marine}} {{environment}} of micro-organisms that are present in sewage was investigated. A literature survey was carried out and studies were done in the laboratory, at an offshore outfall and at a surf-zone outfall. In the laboratory raw sewage was mixed with sea water at known dilutions and the die-off of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and coliphage was monitored. At the <b>offshore</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> a tracer, Rhodamine B. was released in the pump station {{and the distribution of}} the plume around the diffuser was determined by means of the Rhodamine B concentrations and faecal colifonns counts. At the factory surf-zone outlet the Rhodamine B was injected into the pipeline. Samples were taken at 50 and 100 meter distance from the outlet. Thedie-off of faecal colifonns, faecal streptococci and coliphage was monitored. The following results were obtained: Literature study: (i) Coliforms • Temperatures of 15 QC and lower are conducive to survival while nutrients, at a concentration as low as 2, 5 mg/L organic carbon, stimulate growth. A rise in salinity has a negative effect on the organisms. • The T 90 value in direct sunlight is 35 days). Changes in weather• conditions, sunlight intensity, hours of sunlight, depth and turbidity of seawater and different seasons are the most important factors accounting for the variations in the T 90 values. • It is, therefore, important for the initial dilution to be large enough. This will ensure that the bacterial counts conform to the water quality criteria, as the die-off rates {{in the marine}} environment are slow and not always adequate, except around mid day. • Faecal coliforms as a single parameter is not considered to be the best indicator of marine pollution. • The 1 : 4 ratio between faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci for human faeces and 1 : 0, 7 ratio for animal waste are not applicable in the marine environment. The survival of faecal streptococci in seawater is better than that of faecal coliforms and the ratio therefore changes. (ii) Enterococci and pathogens • The T 90 value for faecal streptococci is double that of coliforms and also varies in the dark. In direct sunlight any change in sunlight intensity, change the T 90 values. • In general the numbers of faecal streptococci and pathogens occuring in sewage are smaller than those of coliforms, but their survival time is longer. This could lead to a situation where the water quality complies with the criteria according to the coliform counts, while a health risk may exist due to th survival of pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Estuarine environments are biologically {{productive}} ecosystems {{that are}} both economically and socially important. Consequently, {{a decline in the}} microbiological water quality can pose a risk to human health and have severe socioeconomic consequences, especially for areas that rely on tourism and shellfisheries for income. The enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in water samples has been the paradigm for estimating water quality in coastal zones, but there is an emerging view that sediments are a poorly studied and yet a significant reservoir of FIB. The aims of this thesis were: (I) to investigate the role of sediments as a reservoir for FIB and other potentially pathogenic bacteria; (II) to examine the spatial ecology of FIB in relation to sediment composition (grain size and organic matter content); (III) to investigate the influence of point and diffuse pollution sources on the abundance of bacteria in marine and estuarine sediments; (IV) to investigate the abundance of human pathogenic bacteria in the Conwy estuary, North Wales, UK, and (V) to investigate the influence of suspended particulate matter (SPM) on the survival of FIB in both fresh and brackish water. Culturable E. coli, total coliforms, enterococci (FIB), Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio spp. and heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated in sediments and water from the Conwy estuary that is subject to various point and diffuse sources of pollution. FIB counts were three orders of magnitude greater in sediments compared with the overlying water column, demonstrating that estuarine sediments are a significant reservoir for FIB and other potential pathogens. In addition, sediment grain size analysis and organic matter content determinations revealed that finer sediments such as clay, silt and very fine sand contained significantly higher concentrations of all bacterial groups enumerated. The enumeration of FIB in marine sediments surrounding an <b>offshore</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> pipe revealed that spatial variations in FIB abundance reflected the course of the sewage effluent plume as predicted by a hydrodynamic model, demonstrating the impact of point sources of microbial pollution on the underlying sediments. To address the actual pathogen content of sediments in the Conwy estuary (rather than only indicator bacteria), PCR and qPCR were utilized to detect and quantify known pathogen virulence genes, revealing that estuarine sediments are a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, qPCR suggested greater concentrations of FIB compared with culture counts from the same sample, indicating the possible presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria. Consequently, sediment-associated bacteria pose a risk to human health if they are resuspended into the water column under certain hydrodynamic processes, as tide-dominated estuaries usually contain large areas of fine sand that are easily mobilized. To investigate the influence of SPM concentration on FIB survival, fresh and brackish water containing low (~ 16 mg/l), high (~ 160 mg/l) and extreme (~ 1650 mg/l) SPM concentrations were inoculated with crude sewage and sheep faeces. FIB were enumerated every 24 hrs for 5 days, revealing that SPM concentrations influence FIB survival in brackish water but had minimal influence in freshwater over time. In general, FIB concentrations increased with a decrease in SPM concentration. These data add to a limited body of evidence on the role of sediments as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria, with implications for routine monitoring protocols that assess the microbial pollution of environmental waters. In addition, these data suggest that catchment-based risk assessments of microbial pollution in aquatic systems should consider the source of FIB, the hydrodynamics of the environment, and the subsequent influence of SPM concentrations, all of which determine the survival of FIB in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|Gastroenteritis, upper {{respiratory}} complaints and dermatological infections can all result from swimming in sewage polluted waters. Current United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines require that recreational beaches are routinely {{tested for the}} presence of sewage contamination. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and enterococci, are all intestinal microflora of warm-blooded animals and are the indicators of choice. It is assumed that high concentrations of these organisms in water imply fecal contamination and hence warn of health risk to swimmers. Although local Health Departments routinely assess the quality of beach water, they do not test the sand. 1 bis is surprising since most beachgoers spend more time in contact with sand than water. The present study was part of a two-year project funded by the EPA designed to assess the microbiological quality of beach sand and its possible health risks. Over a ten-month sampling period, water, wet sand, and dry sand samples were collected and the levels of enterococci and fecal coliforms were compared at two South Florida beaches. Levels of fecal indicators were consistently higher in the dry sand relative to the wet sand and were lowest in water. An attempt to source track these indicators using the Biolog identification system suggested that bacteria in sand were from multiple sources. There was, however, some evidence to suggest that gull droppings and land runoff were major inputs to the beach. Surprisingly, <b>offshore</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> were not found to be a major source in this study. Microspatial sampling of beach sand showed patchy distribution of enterococci. Gull droppings, which provided dense localizations of bacteria, and the subsequent translocation of enterococci through the activity of beachgoers probably accounted for most of the heterogeneity in the dry sand. Enterococci in the wet sand were more evenly distributed presumably due to the normalizing effect of wave action The swash zone, close to the area where water managers collect samples for analysis, had much higher counts of enterococci than 10 m offshore. This was due to wave action washing enterococci from the sand into the water column. Research by colleagues showed that enterococci displayed enhanced survival and growth in the sand and suggested that they should be referred to as 2 ̆ 7 environmental 2 ̆ 7 enterococci. The delineation between environmental and pathogenic bacteria in the sand was investigated in this study using a molecular approach. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was shown to be able to detect pathogenic Salmonella in beach sand. However, no clear relationship was apparent between the presence of pathogens on the beach and the numbers of indicator bacteria enumerated by traditional methods. Moreover, results from a health survey conducted at the study beaches showed no obvious health risks associated with exposure to beach sand. It is likely that sand fecal indicator bacteria are predominately 2 ̆ 7 environmental 2 ̆ 7 and that when these bacteria are washed into the swash zone, they could lead to unwarranted beach closures. It is recommended that water managers should consider sampling beyond the current testing depth of 3 ft (1 m) to avoid the detection of enterococci from the sand...|$|R
