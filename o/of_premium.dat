5|$|University {{president}} Robert Bruininks {{originally planned}} to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium.

5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the effect of motives for take-overs and ownership structure on the level <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> paid in take-over transactions in Malaysia. Using 136 take-over transactions for the period of 1990 - 1999, we found that the take-over premiums were much higher than those in developed countries. The various motives for take-overs had different impact on the level <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> paid in different industries. The evidence also suggests that the main motive of the bidders was more towards enhancing the earnings base of the bidders rather than playing the disciplinary role for under-performed target. Family-owned firms paid a lower level <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> compared to non-family firms unless the targets had good performance (relatively higher ROAs). This study concludes that ownership by family aligned the interests of the owners to that of the shareholders rather than resulting in the expropriation of minority shareholders...|$|R

40|$|The insured’s {{effort that}} can lower the {{accident}} probability are grouped under two parts. Before {{the insurance contract}} holds, one can be observed by insurer, the other cannot be observed.

However, if that effort cannot be observed, the insurer at most discounts for insured that does not occur the accident. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare these two situations. This paper provides two propositions. First proposition is that the existence of observability lowers the discount rate <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> in order to facilitate the insured’s effort.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} level and {{dispersion}} <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> paid for individual health insurance by comparing asking price' data posted on an electronic insurance exchange with survey data on premiums actually paid in the period just {{before the advent of}} electronic exchanges. The primary theoretical question is whether the pattern of differences between asking prices and transactions prices can be explained using a simple search theory. We hypothesize, following suggestions of Stigler and Rothschild, that higher risks who expect to pay higher premiums for a given policy will engage in more intensive search than lower risks, given the same distribution of asking prices. As a result, for a given distribution of asking prices, the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> actually paid (transactions prices) will be smaller for higher risks. Therefore, the introduction of an electronic exchange should have a larger potential influence on the dispersion and level <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> paid for lower risks than for higher risks. We find evidence consistent with each of these hypotheses. ...|$|R
