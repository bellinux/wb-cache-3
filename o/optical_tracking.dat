5|$|Preliminary {{work in the}} {{planning}} of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio tracking and telemetry stations and three <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> stations. In addition to Svalbard, tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
25|$|Tunguska {{underwent}} further improvement when, in 2003, the Russian {{armed forces}} accepted the Tunguska-M1 or 2K22M1 into service. The M1 introduced the new 9M311-M1 missile, which {{made a number}} of changes allowing the 2K22M1 to engage small targets like cruise missiles by replacing the eight-beam laser proximity fuze with a radio fuse. An additional modification afforded greater resistance to infrared countermeasures by replacing the missile tracking flare with a pulsed IR beacon. Other improvements included an increased missile range from 8 to 10km, improved <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> and accuracy, improved fire control co-ordination between components of a battery and the command post. Overall, the Tunguska-M1 has a combat efficiency 1.3–1.5 times greater than the Tunguska-M.|$|E

5000|$|... 35mm Mono Optical: These were dual-purpose {{prints and}} could be used either with or without Sensurround. The <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> was a {{composite}} mix {{of the program and}} the control tones and were compatible with any optical playback system. All mono mixes of the Earthquake soundtrack contain the control tones. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> varied from −28 dB to −20 dB below 100% modulation. Activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −30 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, the composite mono soundtrack was used, with its volume and timing regulated by the 25 Hz control tone.|$|R
5000|$|... 35mm 4-Track Magnetic with <b>Optical</b> <b>Track</b> (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono optical print. Unlike {{standard}} magoptical prints, {{in which}} the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> was a mono version of the magnetic stereo <b>tracks,</b> the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> on magnetic Sensurround prints contained only the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track {{was used in the}} normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.|$|R

These incoherent beams scattered easily, reducing effectiveness in mist and rain and causing multiple returns, requiring the gunner to identify the correct return after estimating the range by sight. This, combined with the large and vulnerable design of the transmitter and receiver assembly, led to the abandonment of the OPTAR system in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp {{was the first step}} toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a radio guidance and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter.|$|E
2500|$|The Buk-M1-2 TELAR {{uses the}} GM-569 chassis {{designed}} and produced by JSC MMZ (Mytishchi). TELAR superstructure is a turret containing the fire control radar {{at the front}} and a launcher with four ready-to-fire missiles on top. Each TELAR is operated by a crew of four and is equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection. The radar fitted to each TELAR, {{referred to as the}} 'Fire Dome' by NATO, is a monopulse type radar and can begin tracking at the missile's maximum range (32km/20mi) and can track aircraft flying at between 15m and 22km (50 to 72,000ft) altitudes. It can guide up to three missiles against a single target. The 9K37 system supposedly has much better ECCM characteristics (i.e., is more resistant to ECM and jamming) than the 3M9 Kub system that it replaces. While the early Buk had a day radar tracking system 9Sh38 (similar to that used on Kub, Tor and Osa missile system), its current design can be fitted with a combined <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> system with a thermal camera and a laser range-finder for passive tracking of the target. The 9K37 system can also utilise the same 1S91 Straight Flush 25kW G/H band continuous wave radar as the 3M9 [...] "Kub" [...] system.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>tracking</b> {{entails the}} use of a camera to relay {{positional}} information of objects within its inherent coordinate system by means of a subset of the electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths spanning ultra-violet, visible, and infrared light. Optical navigation has been in use for the last 10 years within image-guided surgery (neurosurgery, ENT, and orthopaedic) and has increased in prevalence within radiotherapy to provide real-time feedback through visual cues on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). For the latter, a method of calibration is used to align the camera's native coordinate system with that of the isocentric reference frame of the radiation treatment delivery room. [...] Optically tracked tools are then used to identify the positions of patient reference set-up points and these are compared to their location within the planning CT coordinate system. A computation based on least-squares methodology is performed using these two sets of coordinates to determine a treatment couch translation that will result in the alignment of the patient's planned isocenter with that of the treatment room. These tools can also be used for intra-fraction monitoring of patient position by placing an optically tracked tool on a region of interest to either initiate radiation delivery (i.e. gating regimes) or action (i.e. repositioning). Alternatively, products such as AlignRT (from Vision RT) allow for real time feedback by imaging the patient directly and tracking the skin surface of the patient.|$|E
