5000|$|In the mid-1940s it {{was decided}} to build a third runway for the Sydney Airport. This runway was to jut out into Botany Bay at the {{position}} <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Cooks River.

This relocating <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river allowed for widening and deepening <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river and the now adjacent <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river's tributary, Muddy Creek. The widened and deepened <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Muddy Creek was renamed Kyeemagh Canal.

The changes in Muddy Creek allowed boating facilities and so the Brighton Fishermans Club ( [...] formerly the Brighton-le-Sands Amateur Fishmans Club) was formed.|$|R
