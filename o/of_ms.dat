5|$|In 1955, US 98 {{replaced}} the MS 24 designation from US 51 in McComb to east of McLain; as a result, MS 24 was {{split into two}} segments. In 1957, the paved portion <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 west of Woodville was extended further to the west. The eastern segment <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 between McLain and the Alabama border was redesignated as MS 594 in 1958. In 1962, the highway was paved to a point east of Fort Adams. Paving was completed on the remainder <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 leading to Fort Adams in 1964. In 1967, the eastern terminus <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 was truncated to its current location at the interchange with I-55; US 98 {{replaced the}} route between there and US 51. Since then, MS 24 has remained on the same alignment.|$|E
5|$|The Lucedale section <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 198 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 98 northwest of Lucedale in George County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Main Street.

MS 198 curves southeast away from the tracks into more forests, eventually entering Lucedale. The road heads through wooded areas of homes before turning east and passing through the commercial downtown. In this area, the highway intersects the eastern terminus <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 26 and the northern terminus <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 613. The road leaves Lucedale, crossing a Canadian National railroad line and heading into a mix of farmland and woodland with some development.

5|$|MS 24 heads east into Liberty and intersects the {{southern}} terminus <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 567. The highway passes commercial development {{and comes to}} an intersection with MS 48/MS 569. At this intersection, MS 48/MS 569 turn east to join MS 24 on Main Street and the road runs through the commercial downtown of Liberty. The portion <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 which continues east from this point until it reaches McComb has been designated as Jerry Clower highway by Mississippi state statute 65-3-71.23. The highway intersects the western terminus <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 584 immediately before MS 569 splits from MS 24/MS 48 by heading to the north. Following this, MS 24/MS 48 passes through more residential areas with some businesses before leaving Liberty. The road becomes unnamed and heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional development, where it curves northeast. The highway continues through rural areas for several miles and {{turns back to the}} east. MS 24/MS 48 enters Pike County and passes through more farmland and forests. MS 48 splits from MS 24 by heading to the south. MS 24 continues through rural areas with some businesses before ending at a cloverleaf interchange with I-55/US 98 west of McComb. At this point, the roadway continues east into McComb as part of US 98.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression <b>of</b> <b>MS,</b> as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The current {{alignments}} <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 198 existed by 1928 as unnumbered roads.

The section of road in McLain became a gravel road by 1933. In 1935, the road west of Tylertown became paved.

In 1940, a new alignment <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 between McComb and Tylertown was under construction, which included what is now MS 198 northwest of Tylertown. Also by this time, the road between Columbia and MS 44 was paved. In 1941, the portions of road in Hattiesburg, east of Beaumont, in McLain, and northwest of Lucedale were paved. The road west of Beaumont was paved in 1943. The portion <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> 24 between McComb and Tylertown was completed as a paved road in 1944. In 1955, US 98 was extended into Mississippi, replacing the MS 24 and MS 15 designations on what is now MS 198.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>MS</b> who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences <b>of</b> <b>MS.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers <b>of</b> <b>MS,</b> but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk <b>of</b> <b>MS.</b> An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
