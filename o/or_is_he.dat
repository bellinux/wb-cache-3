Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper Naționalul, consequently pressured Stere to indicate who Șărcăleanu was ("We wish to know him, does he wear sidelocks <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> a Judaisized Romanian?"). Similar calls were voiced by Vieața, who alleged that Stere himself was a Russian Jew.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other. I mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} as a recurring guest {{actor in the}} fifth season, actor Jonathan Pryce was promoted to regular cast member for the sixth season. Prior to being cast as the High Sparrow, Pryce was approached to play another role {{in one of the}} previous seasons and refused the part. After being approached with the role of the High Sparrow, Pryce stated that he accepted the role because [...] "If the role hadn't been what {{it turned out to be}} for High Sparrow, I probably would not have been involved. I remember starting out and my agent said 'does the character change the situation <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> just a functionary' and this character changes the situation." [...] Pryce added, [...] "Once I started work on Games of Thrones I was incredibly impressed with the organization, the crew and they're really good at their job and story telling so I have become a fan of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
500|$|Clay, {{the protagonist}} of Less Than Zero, [...] "once a paralyzed observer, is now a more active {{character}} and has grown to be a narcissist". The reason behind this shift in character personality was due to Ellis's {{lack of interest in}} the other characters—thus the solipsism is mirrored in the fiction. For Ellis, this became [...] "an exploration of intense narcissism." [...] In 2010, Clay is now a [...] "successful screenwriter" [...] with the [...] "occasional producer credit". He returns to LA to help cast The Listeners (reminiscent of Ellis' involvement with the 2009 film adaptation of his short story collection The Informers). Now 45, and no longer a disaffected teen, Clay is described by Details as [...] "arguably worse than American Psychos Patrick Bateman"; Ellis says that he would not disagree with this, citing the ambiguous nature of Bateman's crimes. In terms of Clay's psychology, Ellis notes his preponderance for a [...] "masochistic cycle of control and rejection and seduction and inevitable pain", which [...] "is something he gets off on because he's ...a masochist and not a romantic." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes how Clay [...] "shares biographical details with Ellis", a successful party-boy, who in 1985 was [...] "often conflated with his fictional counterpart." [...] Ellis asserts to the contrary, [...] "I'm not really Clay." [...] As opposed to his portrayal in Less Than Zero, Clay is more unambiguously manipulative in Bedrooms; he is, in Ellis' words, [...] "guilty". As in Zero, Clay has stagnated in an impassive and jaded state, abusing alcohol and sedatives such as ambien, [...] "living with a kind of psychic [...] "locked-in" [...] syndrome." [...] As in Zero and Psycho, the novel also poses the question of Clay's perception of reality, The Independent asking [...] "Is Clay really being followed <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> being dogged by a guilty conscience for crimes committed, even when they are crimes of inaction?" [...] Over the novel, [...] "Clay shifts from damaged to depraved"; a [...] "final scene in Imperial Bedrooms of unremitting torture... enacted by Clay on two beautiful teenagers who are bought and systematically abused" [...] demonstrates [...] "Clay's graduation from a passively colluding observer to active perpetrator... who either indulges in torture or fantasizes about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arbore's beliefs {{led him to}} {{join the}} Jura federation, an anarchist cell within the First International, and to become {{initiated}} into Freemasonry (1872). He became strongly opposed to Bakunin's marginalization during the First International's Hague Congress, and signed his name (Z. Ralli) to a letter of protest, alongside Nikolay Ogarev. Also in 1872, Arbore also helped draft the German-language pamphlet which documented Bakunin's condemnation of Nechayev: Ist Netshaejeff ein politischer Verbrecher oder nicht? ("Is Nechayev a Political Felon, <b>or</b> <b>Is</b> <b>He</b> Not?"). With Bakunin and Errico Malatesta, he was personally involved in the anarchist agitation sweeping Restoration Spain during the 1870s: he personally helped translate Bakunin's letter to the Iberian anarchists, but their hopes of inciting a new revolution were unsuccessful; progressively after that moment, Arbore and Bakunin grew estranged from one another. According to Woodcock, the reason behind this [...] "personal" [...] rather than ideological conflict was Bakunin's [...] "tactless" [...] support for Arbore's adversary Mikhail Sanzhin, leading Arbore and his partners, the [...] "young Bakuninists", to establish the Revolutionary Community organization. The reasons and objectives of this group, whose other members were Vladimir Holstein, Alexander Oelsnitz and Nikolai Ivanovich Zhukovsky, were outlined {{in a letter to}} Jura anarchist James Guillaume.|$|E
