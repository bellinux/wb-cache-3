It is not, however, unknown to sportsmen, who land--with leave--upon the main island and shoot the handsome 'Deserta petrels,' the cagarras (Puffinus major, or sheerwater), the rabbits, the goats that have now run wild, {{and possibly a}} seal. A poisonous spider is here noticed by the guide-books, and the sea supplies the edible pulvo (octopus) and the dreaded urgamanta.

30|$|What is the {{coloring}} agent producing the purple on the folios? After measuring the manuscripts, we compared these results with reference substances. Red dyes such as madder, cochineal-kermès, and lac-dye, were quickly put aside, since their spectral profiles were too {{different from the}} measurements made on the manuscript. Our {{results showed that the}} purple color in lat. 11937 ’s decorations is similar to purple parchment in lat. 9380. These colours, also called folium, were most likely obtained from Chrozophora tinctoria a tinctorial plant in the Euphorbiaceae genus, growing in the Mediterranean region referred to the Bernard Guineau’s work [25] and to the results of analysis made by Flieder [33],—it referred also to those undertaken by a team of the Research laboratory on Historic monuments, LRMH Champ-sur-Marne working with the department for the restoration of the BnF, which concluded that colouring agents derivatives of orcinol that we can find either in <b>orchils</b> or in Chrozophora tinctoria L. were present [24, 34]; and it referred to the work of Fuchs and Oltrogge [21]—. This dye was used several times decorating the Fleury manuscripts in the 10 th and 11 th centuries (Orléans BM. 127 and 145), and it was identified in older manuscripts as well using the same method, as indicated in Guineau’s studies (BNF lat. 7520, lat. 2421; Amiens BM. 11, 18, 223; Vatican reg.lat. 124). In his papers, Guineau indicates that the word “folium” was often used in technical treaties as early as the 9 th century, including in the Mappae Clavicula, to describe a purple colour, although folium can also produce shades of pink that can go towards red or blue. We also observed these variations on the manuscripts we studied. A treatise preserved in London indicates the origins of folium: this helped Merrifield and other authors to identify Chrozophora tinctoria. Its use declines later in the Middle Age [35]. It seems to disappear from recipes of colour treatrises from the 14 th century {{for the benefit of the}} easier to find colouring agents: madder, kermès, brésil.|$|R

50|$|At every turn, Columbus {{seems to}} attempt to portray the islands of the Indies as {{suitable}} for future colonization. The notion of colonization for profit was not unfamiliar at the time. The Portuguese had already colonized the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores and erected considerable export industries in timber, sugar and dragon's blood, and the Castilian crown {{was in the process}} of completing its conquest of the Canary Islands, drumming up trade in <b>orchil</b> and slaves as they went.|$|E
50|$|Purple dyes from lichens were {{historically}} {{very important}} throughout Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries. They were generally extracted from Roccella spp. lichens {{imported from the}} Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Madagascar, or India. These lichens, and the dye extracted from them, are called <b>orchil</b> (variants archil, orchilla). The same dye was also produced from Ochrolechia spp. lichens in Britain and was called cudbear. Both Roccella spp. and Ochrolechia spp. contain the lichen substance orcin, which converts into the purple dye orcein in the ammonia fermentation process.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, Infante D. Henrique first {{authorized}} {{the settlement of}} the Azores, and many settlers from the historical provinces of Estremadura, Alto Alentejo, Algarve and Madeira travelled to São Miguel, under the Carta Régia (a decree of the regency). The fertile soils and temperate climate attracted settlers from other countries, notably French people and cultural minorities such as Jews and some Moors. Its geographic position and fertile soils permitted rapid economic development. The establishment of a military garrison made the island an obligatory port-of-call in the African and Asian commercial trade, while the export of sugar, and later <b>orchil</b> (a dye exported to Flanders for the making of cloth) stabilized the island's export trade.|$|E
50|$|The {{first period}} of the conquest of the Canaries {{was carried out by}} the Norman nobles Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle.

50|$|In the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany {{began to}} create the first {{synthetic}} dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented {{at about the same}} time.

Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3-4 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.|$|E

John de Graham's name is still perpetuated {{in the district of}} Grahamston. The grave of Sir John de Graham in Falkirk churchyard is still to be seen, with table stones of three successive periods above it.

50|$|With De la Cerda {{out of the}} picture, {{other parties}} resumed their adventures and we have notices of further {{expedition}}s by Majorcans (now annexed to Aragon) to the area - Jaume Ferrer in 1346 (aiming for Senegal, but might have touched the Canaries), Arnau Roger in 1352, and a royal-sponsored expedition by Joan Mora in 1366 (with instructions to also patrol for interlopers). These expeditions (and doubtless many other unrecorded ones, not only by Majorcans, but also likely by merchants of Seville and Lisbon) were almost wholly commercial, with {{the primary purpose of}} capturing native islanders to sell as slaves in European markets. But there was also some peaceful trade with the locals, particularly for <b>orchil</b> and dragon's blood, which grew wildly on the islands and were much valued as dyes by the European cloth industry.|$|E
50|$|The purple from lichens was an {{important}} commercial product and came {{in a variety of}} forms, for example, <b>orchil</b> and cudbear. By the 1830s the researches of Pierre Jean Robiquet (1780-1840), Friedrich Heeren (1803-1885), Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Robert John Kane (1809-1890) into the constituents of lichens had revealed three colour precursors: orcinol, erythrin and pseudoerythrin, but their constitution was not precisely known. Liebig encouraged Schunck to reinvestigate the subject using dye-producing lichens that grow on the basalt rocks of the Vogelsberg in Upper Hessia. In 1842, he discovered a new compound which he called lecanorin. His interpretation of the analyses of lecanorin (now called lecanoric acid) went astray because he used an incorrect formula for orcinol and because his lecanoric acid had partially hydrolysed to give orsellinic acid leading to an incorrect result. The true story was unravelled by Stenhouse some years later. Later he discovered, in addition to lecanoric acid, another new compound, parellic acid from Lecanora parella.|$|E
50|$|The {{first period}} of the conquest of the Canaries {{was carried out by}} the Norman nobles Jean de Bethencourt and Gadifer de la Salle. Their motives were {{basically}} economic: Bethencourt possessed textile factories and dye works and the Canaries offered a source of dyes such as the <b>orchil</b> lichen.Bethencourt received important political support in the court of King Henry III of Castile. His uncle, Robert de Braquemont, gained the king's permission for the conquest of the Canary Islands on behalf of the Norman noble. In exchange for these rights Bethencourt became a vassal of the Castilian King. Robert de Braquemont invested a significant amount in the venture. The story of the Bethencourt Conquest was recorded in the chronicle known as the Canarien, compiled by two clerics Pierre Bontier and Jean Le Verrier. The original was adapted in two later versions, one by Gadifer de La Salle (which appears the more reliable of the two) and the other by the nephew of Bethencourt, Maciot de Bethencourt.|$|E
5000|$|Orcein, also archil, <b>orchil,</b> lacmus and C.I. Natural Red 28, are {{names for}} dyes {{extracted}} from {{several species of}} lichen, commonly known as [...] "orchella weeds", found {{in various parts of}} the world. A major source is the archil lichen, Roccella tinctoria. Orcinol is extracted from such lichens. It is then converted to orcein by ammonia and air. In traditional dye-making methods, urine was used as the ammonia source. If the conversion is carried out in the presence of potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, and calcium sulfate (in the form of potash, lime, and gypsum in traditional dye-making methods), the result is litmus, a more complex molecule. The manufacture was described by Cocq in 1812 [...] and in the UK in 1874. Roberts noted orchilla as a principal export of the Cape Verde islands, superior to the same kind of moss found in Italy or the Canaries, that in 1832 was yielding an annual revenue of $200,000. Commercial archil is either a powder (called cudbear) or a paste. It is red in acidic pH and blue in alkaline pH.|$|E
50|$|Embalming {{began in}} Ancient Egypt around 5,000 years ago. The use of lichens in {{embalming}} {{dates to the}} 18th Dynasty, where Pseudevernia furfuracea was found in an Egyptian vase. The process began with a slit in the abdomen; the organs and viscera were removed. The organs and viscera were wrapped in separate linen packets and replaced in the body or put in canopic jars between the legs. The body cavity was then packed with lichen, sawdust, bruised myrrh, cassia, and other spices. Pseudevernia furfuracea was employed due to its preservative and aromatic qualities. Also it was used simply as a highly absorbent, light-weight packaging material. It also contains antibiotic substances. These qualities helped inhibit bacterial decay of the mummies. Another discovery is that the Egyptians would grind and mix Pseudevernia furfuracea with their flour for bread. The bread was then placed with the mummy and {{thought to be the}} first meal for the mummy in its afterlife. Pseudevernia furfuracea was imported shiploads from the Grecian archipelago to Alexandria. Today, embalming fluids are colored from the lichen dye <b>orchil</b> into a product called Cudbear, illustrating how a historical procedure can influence future practices.|$|E

Although no evidence has survived of any permanent Roman settlements, in 1964 Roman amphorae were discovered in waters off Lanzarote. Discoveries made in the 1990s have demonstrated in more definite detail that the Romans traded with the indigenous inhabitants. Excavations of a settlement at El Bebedero on Lanzarote, made by a team under Pablo Atoche Peña of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Juan Ángel Paz Peralta of the University of Zaragoza, yielded about a hundred Roman potsherds, nine pieces of metal and one piece of glass at the site, in strata dated between the 1st and 4th centuries. Analysis of the clay indicated origins in Campania, Hispania Baetica and the province of Africa (modern Tunisia).|$|E
40|$|Dyes from {{shellfish}} (2 ̆ 7 murex 2 ̆ 7) and lichens (2 ̆ 7 <b>orchil</b> 2 ̆ 7) originated before 1000 BCE. Murex and <b>orchil</b> became {{symbolic of}} Roman privilege. Purple also attained iconic value as {{an emblem of}} wealth and power. Politics {{played a role in}} dye manufacture, as witness the male-dominated purple dye works which were later 2 ̆ 7 invaded 2 ̆ 7 by female workers. This present study investigates these political issues by replicating the actual murex and <b>orchil</b> method. As we are a female team, our work here confronts references to so-called secret methods which women were (according to earlier historians) unlikely to grasp. Experiments undertaken by our Japanese- Canadian team have revealed features of puple which shed light on political issues. For example, murex and <b>orchil</b> were often used TOGETHER, a strategy that may have developed as a response to depletion of one organism or the other at times of ecological stress. Ancient texts hint at murex/orchil combinations as subterfuge, interpreted by some present historians as fraudulent dyes. By contrast, our work shows that together, murex and <b>orchil</b> produce an IMPROVED dye, one with enhanced fastness and great beauty. There was also a concomitant economic bonus with murex/orchil dyes. Murex was more labour-intensive, and so adding <b>orchil</b> saved time and money. Our replication of murex and <b>orchil</b> purples provides a lens through which to view political and cultural aspects of ancient purple manufacture...|$|E

30|$|Since Antiquity, purple {{has been}} {{associated}} with the colour produced by murex [16]. Dyeing molecules extracted from turnsole, called folium, corresponded well with the range of ancient purple. Another purple colour enjoyed some importance in medieval painting, a dye from lichen called <b>orchil</b> in English [25]. However, except for folium and <b>orchil,</b> the medieval purple was usually produced with mixtures of red and blue pigments [17, 18, 24]. At the end of chapter 62, Cennino Cennini mentioned that “if lapis lazuli stone was not so very good, or if you worked the stone up so much that the blue did not come out violet […] take a bit of punded kermes and a little brazil, cook them together”.|$|E

30|$|We limited {{our case}} study to 47 out of 685 samples for ethical considerations, {{and used a}} {{combination}} of spectroscopic, microscopic and chromatographic techniques to identify dyes and infer the presence of mordants. In conjunction with archival research, these scientific results were successfully cross-referenced with documentary sources. Weld, young and old fustic, quercitron, cochineal, madder, indigo plants and <b>orchil</b> dyes were all found in the samples (weft) in repetitive combinations that suggested well-defined recipes. In turn, these results advanced {{our knowledge of the}} substances used to produce primary and compound colours. Furthermore, we found scientific evidence that points the presence of a water-soluble glaze material, likely a natural gum.|$|E
30|$|Except for {{the sample}} from pattern 443, where no dye {{components}} were identified after both mild and harsh hydrolyses, all samples showed the presence of indigotin. In addition, lighter blue samples also contained indirubin (patterns 436 and 440). Besides indigotin and possible cross contamination, light and dark blue samples from two camblets (patterns 371 and 446) also showed one of the characteristic dye components of hydrolysed <b>orchil</b> (tR 17  min, λmax 588  nm) shown in Additional file 1. Indigotin-containing plants (Indigofera) were widely used for dyeing during the eighteenth century with most of them being sourced from North America, {{where it had been}} introduced to the south in the late seventeenth century, and the Caribbean [59].|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} our richly {{decorated}} corpus of elaborate Carolingian manuscripts has revealed their material similarities and differences. While {{they may be}} stylistics similarities, {{the ways in which}} artists have achieved their own illuminations are variable from one to another manuscript.

The analyses of pigments give evidence of the creative phase of renewal which characterises the reign of Charlemagne {{through the use of a}} large classic palette and also specific materials as lapis, Egyptian blue, folium or <b>orchil</b> for tinting parchments. The analyses of gold and silver decorations indicate the use of alloys rather than pure metals. This may be due partly to scarcity of natural raw materials or partly to the wish to lower the cost of these contemporary creations.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{a review of the}} {{expedition}} sent by Juba II to the South of Mauretania and the Canary Islands, ca. 19 - 10 B.

3000|$|In their {{research}} on English dyes between 1775 and 1860, Mellor and Cardwell mention three lichen species, Rocella tinctoria, Rocella fuciformis, and Variolaria orcina, {{as examples of}} species used to produce <b>orchil</b> dyes. Rocella tinctoria could {{be found on the}} rocky cliffs along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, Madeira, Morocco, the Azores, and along the western coast of Africa. Rocella fuciformis could also be found on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea as well as along the Atlantic coast as far as the English Channel [32]. Dyers in Norwich certainly used cudbear, patented in 1758 by George and Cuthbert Gordon of Leith, Scotland, for dyeing wool and silk a rich purple. The Norwich dyer Michael Stark played a part in its further development, advising the Glasgow dyer George Macintosh in his experiments with cudbear, using most notably Ochrolechia tartarea and various ingredients collected in the Highlands of Scotland [51, 52]. Manufacturers like Hall and Pentin in Heigham on the outskirts of Norwich produced cudbear during the 1820 s, but when they first started production is unknown [53] [...]...|$|E
30|$|During {{this initial}} stage {{of an ongoing}} {{research}} project, we have also made progress {{in one of our}} main goals: contributing to the understanding of these materials as an avenue to ensuring their preservation. While destructive analysis such as HPLC–PDA–MS is often conclusive and commonly used to assess collections, it is not sustainable in a museum or archival environment, where instrumental analysis is often limited, if available at all. By studying dated and well-preserved textiles, such as those presented in our case study, we are providing evidence that we anticipate will help in the management and care of collections. For instance, the presence of light sensitive dyes such as flavonoid- containing yellow and green (quercitron, weld, young and old fustic), and especially purple (<b>orchil)</b> textiles, needs to be taken into consideration when deciding display and storage conditions where light levels should be kept at their lowest. Our findings showed J. Tuthill & Sons dyers used recipes/combinations consistently and repetitively. This poses a question of whether the lack of recipe books is indeed due to the ‘secrecy’ Mellor and Cardwell suggest [5], or if it is related to the ‘slow start of publications’ that Kirby, et. al. attribute to the English wool having been dyed for so long in Flanders and Holland [69]. Because of the consistent and repetitive use of combinations, certain colours and patterns likely contain a dye combination, which can be translated into informed guesses of the presence of certain chromophores therein. These informed guesses, in turn, could allow for collections’ assessment {{even in the absence of}} scientific dye analysis. Further, the presence of what seems to be water-sensitive materials such as a gum used for surface glazing imposes the need for stable and mid-level relative humidity conditions, to avoid either the drying or softening of the coating. In presenting our earliest results, we trust our findings can contribute to the care of these beautiful and important textiles in both swatch form and in costumes and furnishing collections.|$|E
