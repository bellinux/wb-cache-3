In a statement Wallace said: [...] "I've tried to build well — we were a very successful company for a long time. We weren't bad, we weren't doing crazy things. We've made money every year for 20 years, employed a lot of people, paid <b>our</b> <b>taxes.</b> But the financial crisis arrived, completely undermined the value of our assets and we're no longer in a great place."

40|$|We analyze {{a general}} {{business}} tax in an uncertain economy. <b>Our</b> <b>tax</b> system {{allows for a}} time-dependent tax rate and to this end we incorporate a generalized allowance for corporate equity (ACE).

To allow for investors with arbitrary risk attitude we make use of the martingale approach. We show that the after-tax capital market is arbitrage-free and complete if it is arbitrage-free and complete in a world without taxation. We furthermore derive a valuation equation under taxes that we use to specify neutral <b>tax</b> systems. <b>Our</b> <b>tax</b> system generalizes two well-known neutral tax systems: the taxation of economic rent and the tax with allowance on corporate equity as introduced by Boadway/Bruce (1979) and Wenger (1983).

Of the tendency of many of <b>our</b> <b>taxes</b> to increase the expenses of cultivation and the price of corn, I feel no doubt; but the reader will see from the course of argument pursued in this inquiry, that I think a part of this price, and perhaps no inconsiderable part, arises from a cause which lies deeper, and is in fact the necessary result of the great superiority of our wealth and population, compared with the quality of our natural soil and the extent of our territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{value-added}} tax makes a significant part of <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> system and is a key revenue {{of the state}} budget. The VAT is paid to state since January 1, 1993, when it replaced the sales tax. The taxpayer is anyone who buys certain product or service. Since 2015 the basic rate of VAT is 21 %, the reduced rate is 15 %. A novelty in 2015 in the Czech republic has become a reduction of the reduced rate to 10 % for some products, for example baby food, medicaments, books and more. As the payer and the taxpayer of VAT {{are not the same}} subjects, we classify this tax together with excise duties among indirect taxes. The other part of <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> system form direct taxes, which are devided into income and property taxes. The statistical calculations show that an increase of the basic rate of VAT reduces state budget revenues, therefore there is an inverse relationship. Conversely, an increase of the reduced rate of VAT will increase state budget revenues, since the reduced rate applies to goods necessary for survival...|$|R

6000|$|Among other clauses {{mentioned}} in this patent, to shew how advantageous it is to Ireland, there is one {{which seems to be}} of a singular nature, that the patentee shall be obliged, during his term, [...] "to pay eight hundred pounds a year to the crown, and two hundred pounds a year to the comptroller."[8] I have heard indeed that the King's council do always consider, in the passing of a patent, whether it will be of advantage to the crown, but I have likewise heard that it {{is at the same time}} considered whether the passing of it may be injurious to any other persons or bodies politic. However, although the attorney and solicitor be servants to the King, and therefore bound to consult His Majesty's interest, yet I am under some doubt whether eight hundred pounds a year to the crown would be equivalent to the ruin of a kingdom. It would be far better for us to have paid eight thousand pounds a year into His Majesty's coffers, in the midst of all <b>our</b> <b>taxes</b> (which, in proportion, are greater in this kingdom than ever they were in England, even during the war) than purchase such an addition to the revenue at the price of our utter undoing.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} three years the whole of our exports was between 44 and 45 millions. In the three years {{preceding}} the war, it was no more than from 35 to 36 millions. The average balance of the former period was 3,706,000l.; of the latter, something above four millions. It is true, that whilst the impressions of the author's destructive war continued, our trade was greater than it is at present. One of the necessary consequences of the peace was, that France must gradually recover a part of those markets of which she had been originally in possession. However, after all these deductions, still the gross trade in the worst year of the present is better than in the best year of any former period of peace. A very great part of <b>our</b> <b>taxes,</b> if not the greatest, has been imposed {{since the beginning of the}} century. On the author's principles, this continual increase of taxes must have ruined our trade, or at least entirely checked its growth.

But, if what I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.” He asked me, “who were our creditors; and where we found money to pay them?” He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive wars; “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings.” He asked, what business we had out of our own islands, unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our fleet?” Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing army, in the midst of peace, and among a free people. He said, “if we were governed by our own consent, in the persons of our representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private man’s house might not be better defended by himself, his children, and family, than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked up at a venture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred times more by cutting their throats?” ...|$|E
