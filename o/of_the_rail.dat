5|$|Emigrants {{departed}} from an English port (generally Liverpool) and travelled by ship to New York or Boston, then by railroad to Iowa City, Iowa, the western terminus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line, {{where they would}} be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in an operational condition, and kept the two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in operational condition. Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated ad-hoc charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formula is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the distance (...) between the point where the force (...) is measured and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> is greater than <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> (...) by a factor of about 3 or 4 (...) [...] Some other simplifying assumptions have also been made; to describe the force more accurately, <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and <b>the</b> projectile must be considered.|$|R
25|$|LRV 2311 was {{destroyed}} on September 20, 2016 when it departed Tuscany Station into the tail track, and overshot <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> crashing into <b>the</b> tail fence and a metal power pole at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> <b>The</b> LRV was {{retired as a}} result.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of Italian law, track gauges in Italy were defined from <b>the</b> centres <b>of</b> each <b>rail,</b> rather than <b>the</b> inside edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> This gauge was {{measured}} [...] between <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and is known as Italian metre gauge.|$|R
5|$|Amarillo has no {{passenger}} rail service but remains {{an important part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> freight system. The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals {{over the years to}} add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|Bondi Junction had {{originally}} been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rail</b> Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover was built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed {{in time for the}} introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.|$|E
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
50|$|In rail transport, {{track gauge}} is <b>the</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> on a railway track and is {{measured}} between <b>the</b> inner faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load-bearing <b>rails.</b>|$|R
30|$|Guard rails were {{installed}} over <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track bridge to prevent wheel derailment. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guard <b>rails</b> also had <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> stiffening <b>the</b> frame made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and bearer bars, thereby limiting lateral movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> under train passage. <b>The</b> guard <b>rails</b> were continuous across the CESuRa system, {{connected to the}} bearer bars using machined pins, and connected to <b>the</b> guard <b>rail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guard <b>rails</b> {{in order to promote}} distributed curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R
50|$|The middle size has 1,000 mm between <b>the</b> centres <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> which {{explains}} why it is called Italian metre gauge, in spite of it in fact being 950 mm in gauge when measured from <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> in <b>the</b> way gauges usually are measured in other countries.|$|R
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung back towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue (also {{known as}} Coney Island Terminal and signed on some trains as either Coney Island or Stillwell Avenue) is a New York City Subway {{terminal}} in Coney Island, Brooklyn, {{acting as the}} railroad-south terminus for the D, F, N, and Q trains. The large facility, originally built in 1919, was designed {{at a time when}} Coney Island was the primary summer resort area for the New York metropolitan area, with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> lines in southern Brooklyn funneling service to the area. It {{is one of the largest}} elevated transportation terminals in the world.|$|E

5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted {{to try to stop}} the standardization.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Martin Pakula of the Labor Party, newly {{appointed}} State Minister for Public Transport {{announced that the}} rail link had been taken off the agenda with new freeway options being explored instead, however a change of government at the 2010 Victorian State Election to Liberals, saw policy for the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> link return to the agenda, with a promise by the incoming Coalition government to undertake planning for its construction.|$|E
5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the firemen and those who ran the freight trains resolved to stop work in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E

5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rail</b> Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E
5|$|Sightings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> from 1950 to 2003 {{were from}} a {{restricted}} area of West Halmahera Regency, {{at the base of}} the western peninsula of the island, but it was recorded prior to 1950 as far as the southern point of Halmahera. More recent records showed that it is still present in a significantly larger area, including the northeast of the island, and locals claim that it also occurs in the swamps near Kao, in the northwest.|$|E

5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi) {{is a small}} bird <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> family, Rallidae. It is {{the only}} species in the genus Atlantisia. Endemic to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the {{isolated}} south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant flightless bird in the world. The species was described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come {{to the attention of}} scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail's closest relatives are uncertain but may be crakes in the genus Laterallus.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured {{that not only}} was the trackbed kept whole, but the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E
5|$|With {{the closure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's {{main source of}} revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.|$|E
