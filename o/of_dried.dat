5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration.

The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E

Water shortage decreased yield <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> matter and increased contents <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> matter, nitrate, crude protein and ash.

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> and boiled white grape seeds with the ash <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} contents <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> herbarium {{specimens of}} Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new model for {{thermodynamic}} analysis, in terms of exergy, <b>of</b> a <b>drying</b> process. Exergy efficiencies are derived as functions of heat and mass transfer parameters.

As a result, this work is intended not only to demonstrate the usefulness of exergy analysis in thermodynamic assessments <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> processes, but also to provide insights into their performances and efficiencies. It is believed that the present model should be useful to people seeking (i) to optimize the design <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> systems and their components and (ii) to identify appropriate applications and optimal configurations for drying systems.
