[...] The natural environment of Palm Island and adjacent Halifax Bay is ideal for the aquaculture of oysters, shrimp, prawns and mackerel. [...] Over a five-year period in the 1970s Applied Ecology Pty Ltd (an organisation designed to assist Aboriginal communities to develop sustainable industries, funded by the Government) established an oyster lease on Palm Island. [...] At one point the lease had $600,000 worth of oysters. [...] Unfortunately due to alleged poor management and lack of interest among the community the oyster lease fell into disrepair. [...] The farm is purported to have cost $20million.|$|E

In 2002, the Crown settled the historical claims of Te Uri o Hau, a hapu of the northern Kaipara Harbour. As part of the settlement, access to and the rights of the hapu to gather oysters within the existing [...] "Maori Oyster Areas" [...] were recognised.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} community sustainability {{in relation}} to social impact of the implementation by the Vietnamese, Research Institute for Aquaculture No 1 and NSW DPI of <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> into the Ban Sen Province in the Van Don district in North Vietnam, funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). A Photovoice project in which cameras and diaries were given to ten oyster farmers to record their story of impact from <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> was conducted in late 2011. Photo data was then coded into a Five Capitals Framework (environmental, human, social, institutional, produced). Results indicate <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> has been a largely positive impact on lives of farmers and their commune. Income from <b>oyster</b> <b>farming</b> has enabled diversification into other types of farming, provided jobs, more assets, better life quality, and opportunity for the young {{to stay in the}} commune. Social impact was often linked to the new industry with impact across community spirit and quality of life. Some negative impact issues relating to parasites, seed quality, some jobs that were boring and lacking satisfaction and low oyster prices were highlighted. Farmers indicated through photos that the next generation may stay in the area in <b>oyster</b> <b>farming.</b> Photovoice in conjunction with Five Capitals framework is recommended as a means of qualitatively describing the livelihood and community impacts of aid programs which are not captured by the usual economics-focused impact studies...|$|R
