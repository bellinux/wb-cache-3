5|$|The {{intention}} of the union {{was to create a}} common state under Władysław Jagiełło, but the ruling oligarchy of Poland learned that their goal <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> Lithuania into Poland was unrealistic. Territorial disputes led to warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; the Lithuanians at times even found it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles. Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings instead created a process of orientating Polish territorial priorities to the east.|$|E
5|$|The task <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> eastern Honduras {{into the}} Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The {{earliest}} Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given the paucity of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered the natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E

5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> twigs, {{feathers}} and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E

The plebiscite was the second in as many years. In 2015, a similar plebiscite was held that also included a fifth village, Lac Baker. The residents of all communities involved voted in favour of incorporation as a rural community with the exception of Lac Baker's residents, thereby defeating the proposal.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, Hitler {{had agreed}} to the {{creation}} of the SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two Gaue, not a unified autonomous entity.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{looking for}} ways to further improve its {{electronic}} forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> OCR functionality into its forms products. The acquisition deal fell through, though by Fall 1992 Delrina had made a deal with Caere Corporation to include its AnyFax OCR software within its products. This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead.|$|E

5|$|The King County {{government}} {{entered into}} {{an agreement with}} the Dincov family in 1954 to operate a gravel mine on their East Redmond property. The Dincovs' neighbors, in opposition to the gravel mine, proposed to form an incorporated town in order to halt operations. A special election was held on August 14, 1956, and 108 residents voted in favor <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> East Redmond as a fourth-class town, while 67 opposed. The town's government passed an ordinance that prohibited the county's gravel mine operations, leading King County to seek a restraining order against the town. East Redmond officials threatened to arrest county employees violating the ordinance, and the requested temporary restraining order was denied by a Superior Court judge. The county was eventually denied an injunction that removed the town from interfering with the mine, due to expired and lapsed permits.|$|E
5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), emphasized the importance <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the style}} of the Renaissance was {{generally}} regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's Socialist national format. However, in the course <b>of</b> <b>incorporating</b> the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism. Currently the soc-realist centre of Nowa Huta {{is considered to be a}} meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large Panel System apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the later half of the 20th century in Kraków.|$|E
