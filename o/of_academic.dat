Our objective is to provide the entire sector, including universities, learned societies, scholarly publishers, and especially academic libraries, with timely findings and analysis that help them plan for the future. The Survey <b>of</b> <b>Academics</b> covers broadly the population <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> across the UK, {{as well as the}} opportunity to look at disciplinary and institutional stratifications, offering an unusual depth of analysis. Thematically, the Survey <b>of</b> <b>Academics</b> covers resource discovery and current awareness, library collections and content access, the print to electronic format transition, academic research methods and practices, undergraduate instruction, publishing and research dissemination, the role and value <b>of</b> the <b>academic</b> library, {{and the role of the}} learned society. The UK Survey <b>of</b> <b>Academics</b> is designed to closely parallel the Ithaka S+R US Faculty Survey 2012, and an analysis of differences between the two national populations will be released in summer 2013.

40|$|This thesis {{entitled}} ‘Assessing antecedents {{and consequences}} of entrepreneurial activities <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> at South African universities’ investigates whether aspects related to the human, physical and organisational capital resources <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> influence their engagement in consulting, sponsored research, licensing/assignment of intellectual property and the spin-off creation with industry, government and civil society. It also examines {{the way in which}} the entrepreneurial activities <b>of</b> <b>academics</b> impact on their research and teaching outcome parameters. The research study provides scholars investigating academic entrepreneurship, policy makers and university administrators with the key resource drivers of entrepreneurial action.
