40|$|Abstract. Through the mould {{contrasting}} experiments {{the carrying}} capacities and deformation effects <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> rock with different underground roadway arrangements are studied in this paper. On {{the basis of}} experiment measuring results the bearing capacities and strains <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> rock moulds in different stratum roadways and arrangement positions are obtained. It is shown that underground roadway positions in weak rock stratum can bring about more decrease in surround rock bearing capacities and the positions below weak stratum can have high bearing capacity under the high ground pressure actions. The roadway horizontal space enlarging one times may increase more 25 % bearing capacities <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> rock for rock or weak stratum roadway. The dislocation arrangements of roof roadway with below weak stratum roadway can improve about 41. 5 % bearing effects and have a little deformation <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> rock. The research conclusions are important significance of conducting for reasonable designing underground roadway engineering...|$|R

5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E

40|$|Infant {{primates}} do {{not perform}} well in visual tasks where oriented contour or texture elements must be linked over extended space {{in order to}} perceive a global structure against noisy background, e. g., contour integration (Kiorpes et al, 2003). The neural basis of this immaturity has not been explored. In adult monkeys, we previously showed that stimulation of small, restricted regions <b>of</b> RF <b>surround</b> facilitates the RF center responses of V 2 neurons while other regions suppress the center responses depending on the location and the orientation <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches, which suggested that V 2 neurons {{may be able to}} encode colinearity and/or angles sustained by multiple contour elements that extend way beyond the RF center of V 2 neurons (Zhang et al, 2008). Here we studied the postnatal development <b>of</b> such facilitatory <b>surround</b> effects in V 2 neurons of anesthetized infant monkeys ranging in age between 4 and 16 weeks. A pair <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches, matched in size for the unit’s center stimulus, was presented across the RF center at 4 different locations. After determining the optimal location for surround facilitation for each unit, the orientation <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches were varied in relation to that for the center stimuli for 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees. With respect to the position <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> stimuli, the adult-like pattern <b>of</b> facilitatory <b>surround</b> effects did not emerge until 16 weeks of age. Similarly at 8 weeks of age, the facilitatory effects <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patch orientation were substantially different from that in adults or older infants. These results suggest that the functional connections supporting the RF <b>surround</b> <b>of</b> V 2 neurons are considerably immature before 16 weeks of age, and that the inability of low-level extrastriate visual neurons to accurately pool local stimulus feature information over extended space may impose limits {{on the development of the}} perceptual decision-making mechanisms downstream...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: : To {{understand}} {{the basis of}} poor performance by young infants in contour integration tasks, we studied the ability of extrastriate cortical neurons (V 2) to integrate oriented contours or texture elements over extended space. In adult monkeys, we previously found that stimulation of small, restricted regions <b>of</b> receptive field <b>surround</b> facilitates the RF center responses of V 2 neurons while other regions suppress the center responses depending on the location and the orientation <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches, which suggested that V 2 neurons {{may be able to}} encode colinearity and/or angles sustained by multiple contour elements that extend way beyond the RF center of V 2 neurons. In this study we investigated the postnatal development <b>of</b> such facilitatory <b>surround</b> effects in V 2 neurons of anesthetized monkeys ranging in age between 4 and 16 weeks. Methods: : A pair <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches, matched in size for the unit’s RF center stimulus, was presented across the RF center at 4 different locations. After determining the optimal location for surround facilitation for each unit, the orientation <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patches were varied in relation to that for the center stimuli for 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees. Results: : With respect to the position <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> stimuli, the adult-like pattern <b>of</b> facilitatory <b>surround</b> effects (optimal for the top/bottom position) did not emerge until 16 weeks of age. Also the optimal facilitatory effects <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> patch orientation (co-linearity) at the top/bottom position did not become adult-like until 16 weeks of age. Conclusions: : These results suggest that the functional connections supporting the local regions <b>of</b> RF <b>surround</b> in V 2 neurons are considerably immature before 16 weeks of age, and that the inability of low-level extrastriate visual neurons to accurately pool local stimulus feature information over extended space may impose limits {{on the development of the}} perceptual decision-making mechanisms downstream...|$|R
5|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, {{there was a significant}} Jewish majority in Białystok. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Białystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tatars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration within Poland and urbanization <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> areas.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire's {{government}} initially {{adhered to}} a conservative and cautious approach, {{and refused to}} annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s. Opponents to the village government's methods, however, won out in later years; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> villages, they oversaw the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center {{over a period of}} years following 1983. Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of Half Day from which it was created, but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994; the court case set the present-day border between the two villages, which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue. To consolidate these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993, and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue; the village's endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons. These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.|$|E

5|$|New, {{adjoining}} roads gradually {{began to}} appear, such as Lamesley Road, which later became Kells Lane, and Low Fell Road, which became Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank. In January 1841, local poet Thomas Wilson bought land on Durham Road and opened literary rooms which were opened in November 1841. The upper {{section of the}} literary rooms {{was used as a}} school for local children until the opening of a new school on a site at Kells Lane in 1895. In the 1880s there was a decade of intensive building and the population of the village increased accordingly. The relative tranquility of the village, coupled with scenic views <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> hills and countryside, attracted rich industrialists from nearby NewcastleuponTyne, seeking an alternative to the dirt and noise of industrial Newcastle and Gateshead. These individuals duly built and lived in mansion property in the area. One such property, Heathfield, was a mansion located on Durham Road which was built and owned by a wealthy chemical manufacturer who kept bears in his substantial adjoining grounds.|$|E
5|$|Roman forces {{took the}} {{initiative}} in AD 9, and pushed into Dalmatia. Tiberius divided the forces into three divisions, two under Silvanus (south-east from Sirmium) and Lepidus (north-west from Siscia), and the third led by himself with Germanicus in the Dalmatian hinterland. The divisions under Lepidus and Silvanus easily defeated their foes, having nearly exterminated the Perustae and Daesitiate, two Dalmatian tribes held up in mountain strongholds. Roman forces captured many cities, with Germanicus himself taking Raetinum (which was lost in a fire set by the enemies during the siege; near Seretium), Splonum (in northern Montenegro), and Seretium (in western Bosnia). Meanwhile, Germanicus and Tiberius pursued Bato until he made a stand at a fortress called Adetrium near Salona, to which the Caesars laid siege. When it became clear he would not surrender, Tiberius attacked the fortress, using {{a steady supply of}} reinforcements. The fortress was overwhelmed and the defenders were killed. While Tiberius negotiated the terms of capitulation, Germanicus went on a punitive expedition across the surrounding territory in which he besieged the fortified town of Arduba, defeating it and obtaining their surrender and that <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> towns. He returned to Tiberius, and sent a Postumius to subdue the remaining districts.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, property development and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality <b>of</b> <b>surrounding</b> public spaces; the lack of provision of outdoor recreation space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; and the failure to consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and groups within the city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E

40|$|Writer's cramp is a task-specific form of focal dystonia, {{characterized}} by abnormal movements and postures {{of the hand}} and arm during writing. Two consistent abnormalities in its pathophysiology are a loss <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> inhibition and overactivity of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). This study aimed to assess a possible link between these two phenomena by investigating whether PMd inhibition leads to an improvement <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> inhibition, in parallel with previously demonstrated writing improvement. Fifteen writer's cramp patients and ten controls performed a simple motor hand task during which surround inhibition was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Motor cortical excitability was measured of the active and surround muscles at three phases <b>of</b> the task. <b>Surround</b> inhibition and writing performance were assessed before and after PMd inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation. In contrast to healthy controls, patients did not show inhibition of the abductor digiti minimi muscle during movement initiation of the first dorsal interosseus muscle, confirming the loss <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> inhibition. PMd inhibition led to an improvement of writing speed in writer's cramp patients. However, in both groups, no changes in surround inhibition were observed. The results confirm a role for the PMd in the pathophysiology of writer's cramp. We show that PMd inhibition {{does not lead to}} restoration <b>of</b> the <b>surround</b> inhibition defect in writer's cramp, despite the improvement in writing. This questions the involvement of the PMd in the loss <b>of</b> <b>surround</b> inhibition, and perhaps also the direct link between surround inhibition and dystonia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
