40|$|During transfection, polycation-DNA {{complexes}} {{are normally}} diluted by the transfection medium, which often contains {{salt in the}} physiological concentration range and serum. It is not exactly known to what extent this dilution step influences <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexes,</b> which in turn influence the transfection efficiency. In order to gain more insight into the size-structure-transfection activity relationship, we prepared histone HI-DNA complexes in NaCl solutions at various concentrations known to determine the size and structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>complexes.</b> We characterized <b>the</b> <b>complexes</b> by physicochemical methods. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy enabled relative measurements of complex sizes even under physiological conditions. <b>The</b> different appearances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexes</b> were correlated with their transfection efficiency.

40|$|In cancer chemotherapy, metal-based {{complexes}} {{have been}} recognized as the most promising means of inhibiting cancer growth due to <b>the</b> successful application <b>of</b> cis-platin and its derivatives above many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing organic anticancer agents.

Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
