Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels <b>of</b> <b>productivity</b> are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income.

On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels <b>of</b> <b>productivity,</b> their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known.

5|$|Human {{language}} has the properties <b>of</b> <b>productivity</b> and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords {{a much wider}} range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{direct impact on}} the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per cent of the country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms <b>of</b> <b>productivity</b> the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. The industry is also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in Air Passenger Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The optimization of times of turning operations {{was done by}} using the analytic and graphic method, which belongs to the linear programming. Findings: The optimization of times of turning operations by using the methods of linear programming caused shortening the total manufacturing time of a sleeve by 2 %. The changes of times permitted on enlargement the volume of produced lots, what guarantees the growth of production about 5 %. The calculated volume of optimum productive lot allows enlargement of the level <b>of</b> total <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> studied process from 95 to 99 %. Research limitations/implications: The methods of optimization such as linear programming depend on degree of complexity of physical and technical relations of the analysed machining processes.
