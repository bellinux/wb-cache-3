5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presidency began.|$|E
5|$|There's no {{question}} in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the Governor of Massachusetts, Endicott Peabody, {{appointed}} McCormack as Chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In October 1965, he {{was appointed}} chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), with a $125,000 salary. To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} for the Library <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues {{to be among the}} top sellers among books in India.|$|E
5|$|In {{all four}} Kentucky constitutions, the first power {{enumerated}} {{to the governor}} is to serve as commander-in-chief of the state's militia and military forces. In 1799, a stipulation was added that the governor would not personally lead troops on the battlefield unless advised {{to do so by}} a resolution of the General Assembly. Such a case occurred in 1813 when Governor Isaac Shelby, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, was asked to lead a band of Kentucky troops to aid William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames. For his service, Shelby received the Thanks <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Congressional Gold Medal.|$|E

5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination of a member <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found {{by a federal judge}} to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E

25|$|In American {{political}} discourse, states' {{rights are}} political powers {{reserved for the}} state governments rather than the federal government according to the United States Constitution, reflecting especially the enumerated powers <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tenth Amendment. The enumerated powers that {{are listed in the}} Constitution include exclusive federal powers, as well as concurrent powers that are shared with the states, and all of those powers are contrasted with the reserved powers—also called states' rights—that only the states possess.|$|E
