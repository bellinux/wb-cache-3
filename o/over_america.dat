The secret nexus of the plot was supposedly the international Bilderberger meetings on banking policy. The anti-Semitic Noontide Press distributed Pawns in the Game for many years.|$|E

Heald served until 1952, and under his guidance, IIT evolved from a small engineering school to a significant technology center. In addition, he was instrumental in shaping the close relationship between industry and the research done at IIT by adding sixty leading industrialists to the board of trustees. Heald also recruited scholars from all <b>over</b> <b>America</b> and Europe, including Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe who designed and built IIT's landmark campus.|$|E
25|$|After rising 98 {{positions}} in the rank, Thiago returned to play on Challenger events, this time all <b>over</b> <b>America.</b> Playing in four tournaments, the left-hander reached the semifinals in two of them. The first one was the Challenger ATP Cachantún Cup, where he lost to countryman Rogério Dutra Silva, in March. The other semifinal was his second Challenger event in Brazil in 2016, the São Paulo Challenger de Tênis, where he lost to Gonzalo Lama in three sets. Returning to Europe, Thiago entered the Open du Pays d'Aix draw unseeded, and with a strong performance, he conquered the title by beating Carlos Berlocq in the final. Thiago played two other tournaments without the same success, before entering the French Open qualifying draw as the 30th seed. Monteiro was beaten in straight sets by Ruben Bemelmans. A week later, Monteiro had a rematch with Bemelmans in 1R of the Franken Challenge, defeating him in straight sets. Thiago later lost in the quarterfinals to Tobias Kamke. Playing in another clay tournament in France, Monteiro reached a second Challenger final, this time at the Open Sopra Steria de Lyon. Seeded 5th, he faced another Belgian this time, Steve Darcis. The left-hander took the first set, but the Belgian grew in the match, turning it in three sets.|$|E

500|$|On release, Billboards {{reviewer}} {{welcomed the}} compilation, writing: [...] "Harrison's remarkable emergence to full artistic recognition after starting {{off as the}} most anonymous Beatle is documented right on this album of memorably beautiful hits." [...] In Melody Maker, {{on the same page}} as his mixed review of Wings <b>over</b> <b>America</b> (which featured live versions of five of McCartney's Beatles-era songs), Ray Coleman provided another favourable assessment: [...] " [...] a highly individual artist who always keeps creative musical company; it's a good album, essential for Harrison students who may not have all the records..." ...|$|E
500|$|Wings {{followed}} Band on the Run {{with the}} chart-topping albums Venus and Mars (1975) and Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976). In 1975, they began the fourteen-month Wings Over the World Tour, which included {{stops in the}} UK, Australia, Europe and the US. The tour {{marked the first time}} McCartney performed Beatles songs live with Wings, with five in the two-hour set list: [...] "I've Just Seen a Face", [...] "Yesterday", [...] "Blackbird", [...] "Lady Madonna" [...] and [...] "The Long and Winding Road".

500|$|In 1782, Pennant {{published}} his Journey from Chester to London. He had then intended {{to write a}} [...] "Zoology of North America" [...] but as he explained in the [...] "Advertisement", since he felt mortified {{by the loss of}} British control <b>over</b> <b>America,</b> this was changed to Arctic Zoology. The book was published, with illustrations by Peter Brown, in 1785–1787. The first volume was on quadrupeds and the second on birds. Compilation of the latter was assisted by an expedition Sir Joseph Banks had made to Newfoundland in 1786. The work was translated into German and French, and part of it into Swedish. The volumes were much acclaimed and Pennant was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1787, a supplementary volume was published which included extra information on the reptiles and fishes of North America.|$|E

500|$|Capitol Records {{released}} The Best of George Harrison on 8 November 1976 in America, {{with the}} catalogue number Capitol ST 11578. The UK issue, as PAS 10011 on EMI's Parlophone label, followed on 20 November. Among Beatles-related releases at the time, the compilation's arrival coincided {{not only with}} that of Thirty Three & 1/3, but also with McCartney's Wings <b>over</b> <b>America</b> triple live album; in addition, EMI belatedly issued the Beatles' 1967 Capitol release Magical Mystery Tour in December 1976, after that album had long proved a popular import in Britain. Writing in the NME in November, Bob Woffinden commented that sales of Thirty Three & 1/3 were sure to be [...] "adversely affected by the almost simultaneous release – next week in fact – of [...] ". According to author Peter Doggett, this calculated scheduling by Capitol/EMI meant that Harrison [...] "would remain a staunch opponent" [...] of the record companies in the concurrent litigation between Apple and its former manager, Allen Klein.|$|E
500|$|While the Beatles were together, {{every song}} written by Lennon or McCartney was {{credited}} as Lennon–McCartney {{regardless of whether}} the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, Please Please Me, which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called Wings <b>over</b> <b>America,</b> which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as [...] "Yesterday," [...] but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making [...] "an attempt to rewrite history".|$|E

Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all <b>over</b> <b>America</b> who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
