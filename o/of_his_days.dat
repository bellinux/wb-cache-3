5|$|Living out {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as a farmer, Jonathan Alder died on January 30, 1849, in Canaan Township, Madison County, Ohio, {{at the age of}} 75. He had become a {{well-known}} figure in the region, and is still remembered today with a school district, high school, and middle school named after him. A historical marker was erected by Ohio in front of Foster Chapel Cemetery at , near West Jefferson, where he is buried. The cabin Alder built in 1806 is now located at the Madison County Historical Society Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress {{with the loss of}} a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he would never leave up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash {{where he}} lives the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping out the whole clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed {{that in order to}} ensure that the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E

5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but to the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate {{after the death of}} his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

25|$|Huard {{acted as}} {{a link between the}} 19th century {{scientific}} period and the scientific revival of early 20th century Quebec, and was a model for those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>days.</b> His major contribution was the publication of his natural history books, who were needed to replace the existing ones who, imported from France, adapted poorly for Canadian realities.
