5|$|Born in 1918, Grayburn {{was educated}} in Dorset {{and joined the}} Army Cadet Force before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He was initially commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and later joined the Parachute Regiment. At the age of 26 he went into action in the Battle of Arnhem where he was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> force that was able to reach Arnhem road bridge. Between 17–20 September he led his platoon, and later the remnants of a battalion, in the defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> British perimeter around the bridge, but was killed after standing up in full view of a German tank in order to direct his men to new positions.|$|E
5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken {{if there is}} anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if {{there is evidence of}} severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E

At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

Following Liu Bang's victory in the Chu–Han Contention, the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief.|$|E

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E

5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> {{courtyard}} is a chapel and {{at the southern end}} is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
