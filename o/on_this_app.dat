The Play Store app description has been updated to clarify that the demo application [...] "includes limited liveness detection only, and spoofing tests conducted <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>app</b> will not be relevant to the product sold through EyeVerify partners". The version of Eyeprint ID that is integrated by partners has liveness detection built in to prevent spoofing attempts.|$|E

The persuasive systems design model offers a framework to identify and operationalize such elements. In this pilot study, we evaluate the questionnaire developed to measure perceived persuasiveness of information technology. We analyzed verbatim user-test transcripts, and performed expert-assessments of the Nurse Antibiotic Information App (NAIA). These data were compared to questionnaire results <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>app.</b> Expert-assessment identified task support, perceived persuasiveness, unobtrusiveness, credibility, perceived effort and perceived effectiveness (as defined in the Persuasive Systems Design model) as being present within the NAIA. These constructs also scored satisfactory in the questionnaire. User-test transcripts {{are in line with}} questionnaire results. Given the consistent results in this pilot study, our approach seems promising for evaluating the questionnaire and will be applied to other settings and websites/application...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 44). This project aims at {{developing an}} android augmented reality application {{that would have}} the capability to show university campus related information such as library, faculty and courses offered from a particular department. All this information is available by getting sensor data from your android device camera and overlaying images in real-time. Augmented Reality (AR) is a generic term for an interactive 3 D environment that blends with our physical reality, usually through a webcam, or in this case, an android device camera. AR by definition is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video graphics or GPS data. The "SDSU University Campus Guide" mobile application is built on by taking pictures and videos of a particular building within a university campus and creating a sensible presentation (by stitching all pictures). Where a user focuses his/her android device camera on to a particular image of a live building, the information related to that particular department will be displayed, after "recognizing" that building from the archived pictures. This application helps University students to get information about events, faculty, department or particular department related courses by just one click <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>app.</b> This AR app uses Vuforia as a software platform and JAVA as a programming language which provides superior vision based image recognition and offers the widest set of features and capabilities to improve the University campus tour guide for the students to get to know their University better and easier. The application has been prototyped of a subset of campus buildings...|$|E

The most effective treatment regimens would be rendered ineffective if patients failed to comply.

This is especially so if clinicians can use such apps to monitor disease/symptoms for diagnosis and adjustment of treatment methods.|$|R

The traditional automation pyramid is dissolving and manufacturing IT is moving towards service-orientation and app-orientation.

Based <b>on</b> <b>this</b> cloud platform, <b>apps</b> have been developed which provide the interface between humans and manufacturing IT as well as the integrated cyber-physical systems. Challenges concerning app development for manufacturing environments are illustrated using the example of an app collecting sensor data and sending this data to a cloud service for further processing...|$|R

The application shows the realistic and digitally rendered scenarios of virtual restoring vision of the places “as they were and where they were” in order to communicate the historical value of the heritage preserved in the Documentary Archives; it prioritizes the visualization of the 3 D reconstructions of architectural heritage based on Archival Resources. Moreover, the 3 D models become interfaces to access different associated 2 D content connected generating a cascading system, structured <b>on</b> hierarchical information. <b>This</b> <b>App,</b> defining a technological framework mainly based on Open Source systems, aims to offer an expandable and repeatable "open data" experience of Cultural Heritage, to make available and accessible “hidden” information...|$|R
