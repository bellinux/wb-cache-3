5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is <b>our</b> <b>most</b> valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is <b>our</b> <b>most</b> reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his work}} is <b>our</b> <b>most</b> {{reliable}} source {{for the history of}} his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned. The Annals are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, who are both called Antonia. The Histories, however, are written from primary documents and intimate knowledge of the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to be more accurate.|$|E

Today's Postmodern era is seen in widespread digitality.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of a fossil record, full classification and phylogeny of the sturgeon species has been difficult to determine, in part due to the high individual and ontogenic variation, including geographical clines in certain features, such as rostrum shape, number of scutes and body length. A further confounding factor is the peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids, even between species assigned to different genera. While ray-finned fishes have a long evolutionary history culminating in <b>our</b> <b>most</b> familiar fishes, past adaptive radiations have left only a few survivors, like sturgeons and garfish.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right {{to do what you want}} with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{philosophers}} of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as <b>our</b> <b>most</b> trusted knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Since {{classical}} times {{a question}} has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes {{seen as a}} conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction, to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, <b>our</b> <b>most</b> logical conclusions can never {{be said to be}} certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.|$|E
25|$|Pediatric care {{is complex}} due to {{developmental}} and dependency {{issues associated with}} children. How these factors impact the specific processes of care {{is an area of}} science in which little is known. Throughout health care providing safe and high quality patient care continues to provide significant challenges. Efforts to improve the safety and quality of care are resource intensive and take continued commitment not only by those who deliver care, but also by agencies and foundations that fund this work. Advocates for children’s health care must be at the table when key policy and regulatory issues are discussed. Only then will the voice of <b>our</b> <b>most</b> vulnerable groups of health care consumers be heard.|$|E
25|$|Islam came to Egypt in the 640s, {{and pressed}} southward; around 651 the {{governor}} of Egypt raided {{as far south as}} Dongola. The Muslims or the Arabs met with stiff resistance. They ceased their offensive and a treaty known as the baqt was signed between the Arabs and Makuria. This treaty held for some seven hundred years. The area between the Nile and the Red Sea was a source of gold and emeralds, and Arab miners gradually moved in. Around the 970s an Arabic envoy Ibn Sulaym went to Dongola and wrote an account afterwards; it is now <b>our</b> <b>most</b> important source for this period. Despite the baqt northern Sudan became steadily Islamicized and Arabized; Makuria collapsed in the 14th century with Alodia disappearing somewhat later.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that {{is characterized by the}} sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, <b>our</b> <b>most</b> important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E
