5|$|From 1833 to 1834, Jackson {{was engaged}} in {{removing}} federal funds from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War. Calhoun opposed this action, considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power. On March 28, 1834, he voted with the Whig senators on a successful motion to censure Jackson for his removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds.</b> However, by 1837 Calhoun generally had realigned himself {{with most of the}} Democrats' policies.|$|E

5|$|In August 2002, the Israeli Military Intelligence Chief {{alleged that}} Arafat's {{personal}} wealth {{was in the}} range of US$1.3 billion. In 2003 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted an audit of the PNA and stated that Arafat diverted $900 million in public funds to a special bank account controlled by Arafat and the PNA Chief Economic Financial adviser. However, the IMF did not claim that there were any improprieties, and it specifically stated that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> had been used to invest in Palestinian assets, both internally and abroad.|$|E

5|$|In January 1893, Palmer {{approached}} the House Appropriations Committee, asking that $10,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> already designated {{to be paid}} over to the Lady Managers {{by the federal government}} be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{could not}} rely on his limited funds to make a {{successful}} entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Roman Revival {{building}} of the observatory was designed by architect Willard Smith after the Roman Tower of the Winds in Athens and was built in 1865. It was named after New York City businessman Daniel S. Schanck, who donated a large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> to construct and equip the observatory. Outfitted with telescopes, clocks, and other scientific equipment donated to Rutgers, the Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical observatory and was used to provide instruction to its students through the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century.|$|E

5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> needed {{to construct the}} hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters {{had never seen the}} temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, very different from the red and white of the Great East Hall. This painting indicates that Foguang Temple was an important stop for Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 {{and the ensuing}} outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral, as they had done during the First World War 25 years earlier. To ensure this neutrality, the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched. Large sums (almost 900 million guilders) were spent on defence. It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime, however, especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany, which deliberately delayed deliveries. Moreover, a considerable part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> were intended for the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), much of it related to a plan to build three battlecruisers.|$|E
50|$|Net {{asset value}} is most {{commonly}} used in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> open-end <b>funds.</b> Shares and interests in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> to each new investor and redeemed by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to <b>the</b> NAV <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> with <b>the</b> intention that new investors receive a fair proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> value in cash.|$|R
25|$|Fund {{governance}} {{refers to}} a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an investment fund to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> is operated in <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> and its investors. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as <b>the</b> four pillars <b>of</b> investor protection that are typically promulgated through <b>the</b> investment <b>fund</b> regulation applicable in <b>the</b> jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund.</b> These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the 1940 Act generally ensure that: (i) <b>The</b> investment <b>fund</b> will be managed in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>fund’s</b> investment objectives, (ii) <b>The</b> assets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>fund</b> will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>fund’s</b> assets, (iv) <b>The</b> investment <b>fund</b> will be managed for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund’s</b> shareholders and not its service providers.|$|R

5|$|Cullompton United Charities {{provides}} {{a number of}} charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations can hire meeting rooms.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people}} and the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, President Gerald Ford {{approved}} the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen {{to assist in}} the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency. Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise, its name was retired {{at the end of the}} 1975 season. As such, the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the Atlantic hurricane basin. However, Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs). Financial closing on the project was reached in October, 2009. Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, operate and maintain it. Those contributions are spread during construction and operation of the tunnel project. During construction, 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million it said to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance during construction, 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state development cost.|$|E
5|$|Six {{million people}} were {{unemployed}} when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million. This was {{in part due to}} the removal of women from the workforce. Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938. Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley. The average German worked 43 hours a week in 1933 and by 1939 this increased to 47 hours a week.|$|E
