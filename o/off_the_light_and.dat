25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride {{as part of a}} breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E
500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how the sooner kids learn to talk, the sooner they learn to talk back, and tells Maggie that he hopes she never says a word. But {{as soon as he}} turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> closes the door, Maggie takes her {{pacifier}} out of her mouth and utters the word [...] "daddy", before going to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Ashe {{switched}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> crept to the door. Out in {{the passage}} he stopped and listened. All was still. He stole downstairs.|$|E
30|$|C and 60 %, respectively. Switch on <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> roll up <b>the</b> blinds for {{the event}}.

60|$|He turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> as {{he crossed}} <b>the</b> house, pressed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>lights</b> as he went, while the many {{unimportant}} little nothings, almost of themselves, ranged themselves into an ordered text of doubt and conjecture {{that he could not}} refrain from reading.|$|R
5000|$|He {{claims to}} have got bored very easily, and used to stop the train between stations, turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> start talking on the {{loudspeaker}} system. [...] "I used to say stuff like: 'This is your driver speaking... or is it?' in a really spooky voice" ...|$|R
60|$|In one of {{his pockets}} he carried a piece of cake, and this he ate with {{satisfaction}} while undressing. Then, when clad only in his pajamas, he turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> moved in the semi-darkness toward the bed.|$|E
60|$|The amateur cracksman {{handed over}} his loot, and retired toward the stairs. Molly {{could hear him}} going down them three at a time, in a whirl of relief and good resolutions. She went to Sir Thomas' room, and {{replaced}} the notes. Having done this, she could not {{resist the temptation to}} examine herself in the glass for a few moments. Then she turned away, switched <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> was just about to leave the room when a soft footstep in the passage outside came to her ears.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence {{told him}} to do so. The lift had stopped between the floors on their ascent, and the {{electric}} light inside it had gone out, while the boy said something about his {{not being able to}} run it much longer. The photographs, however, were not on the bureau and Lawrence searched the room before he found them on the bed. Then he turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> went into the passage, which was rather dark. The lamp at the shaft was not burning, but he could see Walters beckoning at the gate.|$|E
50|$|Fischer {{lives in}} a church, for free, in {{exchange}} for turning <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> locking <b>the</b> doors. It's {{a good fit for}} him - he doesn't really have any aspirations beyond that. As Fischer tries to help Peter recover, Peter quickly learns that Fischer has much more serious problems of his own.|$|R
5000|$|Diane Civita as Miss Nance, the scientists' secretary. Although {{she usually}} seems more {{interested}} in doing her nails, going on her coffee break, and watching her soap operas, she is actually the one who keeps their department running and is always {{there at the end}} of the show to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> say good-night to the bunnies in their cages.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, the CPVPV {{marched into}} an {{educational}} exhibit of dinosaurs at a shopping center, [...] "turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> ordered everyone out, frightening children and alarming their parents". It {{was not clear}} why the exhibit—which had been [...] "featured at shopping centres across the Gulf for decades"—was closed, and Saudis speculated irreverently as to the reason on Twitter.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed the}} others, and after {{stopping}} to tell Kenwardine {{that she was}} going out, Clare drew back a curtain that covered part of the window. Dick stepped across the ledge and, seeing that the stairs below were iron and rather slippery, held out his hand to Clare. The curtain swung back and cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> when they were near the bottom the girl tripped and clutched him. Her hand swept downward from his shoulder across his chest and caught the outside pocket of his coat, while he grasped her waist to steady her.|$|E
6000|$|All {{agreed that}} this would be a very good plan. Chris crawled up with Jack until he reached a spot where he {{commanded}} a perfect view of the yard, and explained to him exactly what he was to do. He had already been told what was going to take place. Knowing that the Kaffirs have very little idea of time, he said: [...] "You will hold it open while you say slowly like this, 'I am showing the light, baas, and I hope that you can all see it.' You will say that over twice and then turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> lie down under that big rock till you hear the explosion. Wait a little, for stones and fragments will come tumbling down. When they have stopped doing so make your way straight to where the horses are; you will find us there before you. Now, repeat over to me the words you are to say slowly twice." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{launched}} his indulgent parent safely {{on a career}} of crime, Jimmy switched <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> returned to the window. Leaning out, he gave himself up {{for a moment to}} sentimental musings. The night was very still. Through the trees which flanked the house the dimmed headlights of what was presumably Jerry Mitchell's hired car shone faintly like enlarged fire-flies. A boat of some description was tooting reflectively far down the river. Such was the seductive influence of the time and the scene that Jimmy might have remained there indefinitely, weaving dreams, had he not been under the necessity of making his way down to the library. It was his task to close the French windows after his father and Ogden had passed through, and he proposed to remain hid in the gallery there until the time came for him to do this. It was imperative that he avoid being seen by Ogden.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning {{that they could get}} charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> stay silent.|$|R
50|$|Each {{compartment}} {{has its own}} door to {{the aisle}} and curtains can be drawn to keep the compartment dark. In the night-trains, passengers in a 2nd class compartment tend to draw <b>the</b> curtains, switch <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> close <b>the</b> sliding door, hoping that no passengers will enter their compartment so the existing passengers have more space. In first class each seat is assigned thus there the system doesn't work.|$|R
5000|$|In off-duty moments he goes door to {{door with}} his fellow Omnian, Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. Entire pubs {{have been known to}} draw <b>the</b> curtains, turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> lie on <b>the</b> floor whimpering at news of his coming down the street. The only [...] "entity" [...] not afraid of Visit's endless {{proselytising}} is his friend and fellow constable Dorfl, a golem with endless patience and a desire to argue faith rationally.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{the first}} time she had used that curious expression! Yet her life was far from dull, so far as he could see; with the new {{interests}} created by the war, and the constant calls on her time made by the perfection of their home life, she had a useful and busy existence. Again the random thought passed through him: 'But she never tells me anything!' And suddenly that lugubrious khaki-clad figure started up among the rose bushes. [...] "We've got a lot to be thankful for!" [...] he said abruptly. [...] "I must go to work!" [...] His wife, raising one eyebrow, smiled. [...] "And I to weep!" [...] Mr. Bosengate laughed--she had a pretty wit! And stroking his comely moustache where it had been kissed, he moved out into the sunshine. All the evening, throughout his labours, not inconsiderable, for this jury business had put him behind time, he was afflicted by that restless pleasure in his surroundings; would break off in mowing the lower lawn to look at the house through the trees; would leave his study and committee papers, to cross into the drawing-room and sniff its dainty fragrance; paid a special good-night visit to the children having supper in the schoolroom; pottered in and out from his dressing room to admire his wife while she was changing for dinner; dined with his mind perpetually on the next course; talked volubly of the war; and in the billiard room afterwards, smoking the pipe which had taken the place of his cigar, could not keep still, but roamed about, now in conservatory, now in the drawing-room, where his wife and the governess were still making swabs. It seemed to him that he could not have enough of anything. About eleven o'clock he strolled out beautiful night, only just dark enough--under the new arrangement with Time--and went down to the little round fountain below the terrace. His wife was playing the piano. Mr. Bosengate looked at the water and the flat dark water lily leaves which floated there; looked up at the house, where only narrow chinks of light showed, because of the Lighting Order. The dreamy music drifted out; there was a scent of heliotrope. He moved a few steps back, and sat in the children's swing under an old lime tree. Jolly--blissful--in the warm, bloomy dark! Of all hours of the day, this before going to bed was perhaps the pleasantest. He saw the light go up in his wife's bed room, unscreened for a full minute, and thought: 'Aha! If I did my duty as a special, I should [...] "strafe" [...] her for that.' She came to the window, her figure lighted, hands up to the back of her head, so that her bare arms gleamed. Mr. Bosengate wafted her a kiss, knowing he could not be seen. 'Lucky chap!' he mused; 'she's a great joy!' Up went her arm, down came the blind the house was dark again. He drew a long breath. 'Another ten minutes,' he thought, 'then I'll go in and shut up. By Jove! The limes are beginning to smell already!' And, the better to take in that acme of his well-being, he tilted the swing, lifted his feet from the ground, and swung himself toward the scented blossoms. He wanted to whelm his senses in their perfume, and closed his eyes. But instead of the domestic vision he expected, the face of the little Welsh soldier, hare-eyed, shadowy, pinched and dark and pitiful, started up with such disturbing vividness that he opened his eyes again at once. Curse! The fellow almost haunted one! Where would he be now poor little devil!--lying in his cell, thinking--thinking of his wife! Feeling suddenly morbid, Mr. Bosengate arrested the swing and stood up. Absurd!--all his well-being and mood of warm anticipation had deserted him! 'A d---d world!' he thought. 'Such a lot of misery! Why should I have to sit in judgment on that poor beggar, and condemn him?' He moved up on to the terrace and walked briskly, to rid himself of this disturbance before going in. 'That commercial traveller chap,' he thought, 'the rest of those fellows--they see nothing!' And, abruptly turning up the three stone steps, he entered the conservatory, locked it, passed into the billiard room, and drank his barley water. One of the pictures was hanging crooked; he went up to put it straight. Still life. Grapes and apples, and--lobsters! They struck him as odd for {{the first time}}. Why lobsters? The whole picture seemed dead and oily. He turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> went upstairs, passed his wife's door, into his own room, and undressed. Clothed in his pyjamas he opened the door between the rooms. By the light coming from his own he could see her dark head on the pillow. Was she asleep? No--not asleep, certainly. The moment of fruition had come; the crowning of his pride and pleasure in his home. But he continued to stand there. He had suddenly no pride, no pleasure, no desire; nothing but a sort of dull resentment against everything. He turned back; shut the door, and slipping between the heavy curtains and his open window, stood looking out at the night. 'Full of misery!' he thought. 'Full of d---d misery!' ...|$|E
5000|$|In the movie, Jack turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> {{closes the}} door to {{apartment}} 291. In the actual series finale, Terri {{is the one who}} turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> the door has the number 201. Additionally, in the movie, Terri is shown dressed in a white nurse's uniform. In the final episode, however, Terri wore a pink dress.|$|E

25|$|It is {{customary}} to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> conduct <b>the</b> {{search by}} candlelight, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs {{out of their}} hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned {{the next day with}} the chametz. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> goes into <b>the</b> bathroom, where Carl has hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on <b>and</b> sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves.|$|R
50|$|There are {{interesting}} forensic details to be {{noted in the}} murder. The Badri Prasad look-alike who commits the murder comes from the main door, stabs Dhaniram in the stomach, switches <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> goes back quietly through the same door.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the drama}} proper commences {{there is a}} quick run through of the action without words. The four {{characters}} enter and exit, as they will all do later, in a style more reminiscent of Quad than the two Act Without Words mimes. Satisfied with this the Voice of Bam says, [...] "Good," [...] switches <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> prepares us for the action.|$|E

5000|$|Chris Howorth notes: [...] "The {{basic idea}} behind calling our new album The Dream is that inside dreams {{anything}} can happen, {{all the things}} that seem impossible or unreachable in the 'real world' become a reality in your dreams. We wanted to make a record that you can lay down with, shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> have a total outerbody experience. We also wanted the record to be like a rollercoaster ride with explosive highs, beautiful lows and everything in between." ...|$|R
50|$|Behavioral and {{occupancy}} patterns - Some {{building management}} policies such as {{limiting the number}} of people in a given area of the building can also contribute effectively to the minimization of heat gains inside a building. Building occupants can also contribute to indoor overheating prevention by: shutting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> equipment of unoccupied spaces, operating shading when necessary to reduce solar heat gains through windows, or dress lighter in order to adapt better to the indoor environment by increasing their thermal comfort tolerance.|$|R
50|$|Access to Newgrange is by {{guided tour}} only. Tours {{begin at the}} Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre from which {{visitors}} are taken to the site in groups. Current-day visitors to Newgrange are treated to a guided tour and an re-enactment of the Winter Solstice experience {{through the use of}} high powered electric <b>lights</b> situated within <b>the</b> tomb. The finale of a Newgrange tour results in every visitor standing inside the tomb where the tour guide then turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> bulb simulating <b>the</b> sun as it would appear on the winter solstice.|$|R

On the fifteenth minute of the art program at the club was <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> the police said the participants leave the premises for a few minutes. Then, the police pursued participants in the streets of the city.|$|E
50|$|The patron {{could control}} the {{presentation}} speed {{only to a}} limited degree. The crank could be turned in both directions, but this did not reverse the playing of the reel. Nor could the patron extend viewing time by stopping the crank because the flexible images were bent into the proper viewing position by tension applied from forward cranking. Stopping the crank reduced the forward tension on the reels causing the reel to go backwards and the picture {{to move from the}} viewing position; a spring in the mechanism turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> in some models brought down a shutter which completely blocked out the picture.|$|E
50|$|Identical {{triplets}} {{who work}} for the Physical Health Department (Osoba Goyou-tai). Because of their questionable imaginations, this usually consists of them attempting various lewd acts on Taro around and during bedtime, which he nonetheless seems to avoid (in the first anime his attempts to dodge them are much less successful, the easiest example being the three of them cornering him in bed {{at the end of the}} first episode. In the manga, he managed to escape, in the anime, one of the girls shuts <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> three hearts pop up, and we hear Taro calling for help). One possible explanation for this is the fact that all three are rather blatantly in lust with him.|$|E
50|$|On April 30, 1968, the Silver Slipper was {{purchased}} by businessman Howard Hughes for $5.4 million in his famous spending spree of buying Vegas properties, which included the Frontier next door. He purchased the casino because {{he was afraid that}} the toe of the slipper, that faced the window of his Desert Inn penthouse, could contain a photographer taking pictures of him. After several attempts at requesting that the slipper be turned <b>off,</b> Hughes purchased <b>the</b> casino, turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> had <b>the</b> rotating mechanism dismantled. The Silver Slipper was sealed, so no one could enter.|$|R
25|$|During {{a public}} meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, {{emotions}} were running high. James Bevel, {{as director of}} the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, and to ask him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> attack <b>the</b> marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.|$|R
50|$|News of {{the murders}} is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating Cossack officer, Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas), boards the train {{with a handful of}} his men. Kazan {{believes}} the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien's existence when Saxton switches <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> Mirov's eyes glow, revealing him to be the creature's host. The creature has absorbed the memories of Wells' assistant, an engineer, and others. It seeks the Polish count's metallurgical knowledge in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan shoots and kills Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.|$|R
