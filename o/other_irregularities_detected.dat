40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the effect of <b>irregularities</b> <b>detected</b> by government auditor on coruruption control and the rectification effort based on government auditor’s recommendation about corruption control. The dependent variable that used in this research is corruption and the independent variables are <b>irregularities</b> <b>detected</b> by government auditor and rectification effort. To strengthen the result of this research, few control variables are used, they are economic growth, open, government size, education, and wage. The population of this research include all of the Indonesia’s provinces. The data that used are secondary data from the attorney general’s annual report, IHPS BPK RI, and Statistical Yearbook of Indonesian. Statistic tool that used in this research is multiple linear regresion. Statistical testing conclude that <b>irregularities</b> <b>detected</b> by government auditor doesn’t have significant impact on corruption, meanwhile retrification effort based on government auditor’s recommendation have significant and positive impact on corruption. Statistical testing to variable control conclude that wage have significant and negative impact on degree of corruption...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveIntraoperative {{detection}} of suboptimal coronary anastomoses allows revision before chest closure. We evaluated an epicardial 13 -MHz ultrasound minitransducer {{as a means}} to detect three different coronary anastomosis construction errors. MethodsIn total, 120 internal thoracic arter-t-coronary artery anastomoses were constructed correctly (n = 60) or incorrectly (n = 60) with one technical error: suture crossover, purse-string or deep toe stitch (n = 20 each). Anastomoses were performed on ex vivo pressure-perfused porcine (96 anastomoses) and human hearts (24 anastomoses). Two blinded observers scanned and scored the anastomoses with epicardial ultrasonography. In 24 human and 24 porcine anastomoses, angiograms were made of 24 correct and 24 incorrect anastomoses and scored by two other blinded observers. Angioscopy and cast injection served as a reference. ResultsOverall, 119 of 120 anastomoses were accurately scored as correct or incorrect within a median of 67 seconds (8 – 381 seconds) by both observers (sensitivity 0. 98, specificity 1. 00, κ 1. 00 (1. 00, 1. 00, and 1. 00 in angiography subset, respectively). One deep toe stitch that induced outflow corner stenosis was spotted by both observers but regarded as insignificant and thus inaccurately scored as correct. In 5 anastomoses, unintended <b>irregularities</b> were <b>detected.</b> By angiography, anastomoses were accurately scored with a sensitivity of 0. 75 and a specificity of 0. 81 (P <. 001 vs ultrasonography) and κ of 0. 54. Angioscopy and cast confirmed ultrasonographic findings and did not reveal <b>irregularities</b> <b>other</b> than <b>detected</b> by ultrasonography. ConclusionEx vivo epicardial 13 -MHz ultrasonography allowed rapid and accurate evaluation of coronary anastomoses and detected technical construction errors with higher sensitivity and specificity than angiography...|$|R
