5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> Loop—from I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece—would become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates–Greece leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> Loop was assigned NY390. The NY390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> Loop between NY104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed.|$|E
