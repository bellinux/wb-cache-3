Why are they spending money on something that's an unnecessary add-on {{at the same time}} they're talking about cutting bus routes again?" [...] The agency's general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered, though TriMet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and the MAX Orange Line's budget was separate from TriMet's financial problems.|$|E

But if you really analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E

[...] A retrospective five-star review from Bruce Eder at Allmusic deemed it [...] "the best studio album in the group's history, electric blues with an acoustic texture, virtuoso lead, slide, and organ playing, and a killer selection of songs." ...|$|E

It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled that a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan {{for the past three years}} and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E

Of the draft Giants' General Manager George Young said, [...] "This is not a blue-chip draft, but a strong blue-collar draft. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> there's better quantity than quality." [...] With their first selection they chose defensive end Eric Dorsey #19 overall from the University of Notre Dame. With their four second-round selections they chose Mark Collins, cornerback out of Cal State-Fullerton, Erik Howard, nose tackle out of Washington State University, Pepper Johnson, linebacker out of Ohio State University, and Greg Lasker, defensive back out of the University of Arkansas.|$|E

500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is out there somewhere, chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E

"I loved {{watching}} {{old black}} and white movies, and I always also loved the music of Glenn Miller and Cole Porter, that whole era of writing, {{and it was my}} attempt to write a song to depict the romantic era.

It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band and I had an argument because I wanted to give Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and became our highest chart hit." ...|$|E

40|$|Science {{and society}} have never quite lived in perfect harmony. This has {{been due to}} a variety of factors {{hindering}} the relationship between these two. Nevertheless, science increasingly affects our daily lives. Regardless of assumptions as to what people should know about science and why they should know it, academic research needs to have a more complete understanding <b>of</b> how <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about science information. The current study examines and attempts to avoid common assumptions previously made in analyzing this question. This study uses a categorization task to reveal how individuals think about science content and correlates individual understandings of the content to individual differences. The findings presented here comprise an initial attempt to define publics for science information according to the ways they inherently and individually make sense of such information, representing a new approach to defining publics for science information. This approach is intended to add an individual component to be taken in combination with previous investigations into the question <b>of</b> how <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about science information, which generally hold that differences are attributable to social, cultural, and geographical factors. Future research under this paradigm may add greatly to our integrated understanding <b>of</b> how <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about science information and may have great and far-reaching practical implications...|$|R
