5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E

Final Fantasy XIII-2 was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, drawing her weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer Yuko Oshima was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players.|$|E

40|$|The Presocratic philosopher Heraclitus quoted {{an ancient}} Greek proverb, “Absent while present. ” This paper argues that social {{technology}}, which makes us present to those absent, also makes us absent to those present. That is, technology connects <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> virtual community of friends but {{in doing so}} it disconnects <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> from those about us. Because we are finite beings, who dwell wherever <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> reside, {{there is a real}} conflict between the connectivity of social technology and bodily communion with those about us. The interpersonal presence afforded by social technology is a presence purchased at a price: the absence of the body. What social technology is incapable of achieving is bodily presence, and bodily presence is needed for intimacy and friendship...|$|R

We thus turn <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> a less ambitious problem: constructing an element of provably high order. In this paper, we survey various algorithms that find an element of high order for general or special finite fields...|$|R
500|$|In 1894, Lemoine stated what is {{now known}} as Lemoine's conjecture: Every odd number which is greater than three can be {{expressed}} in the form 2p + q where p and q are prime. In 1985, John Kiltinen and Peter Young conjectured an extension of the conjecture which they called the [...] "refined Lemoine conjecture". They published the conjecture in a journal of the Mathematical Association of America: [...] "For any odd number m which is at least 9, there are odd prime numbers p, q, r and s and positive integers j and k such that m = 2p + q, 2 + pq = 2j + r and 2q + p = 2k + s. the study has directed <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> more subtle aspects of the additive theory of prime numbers. Our conjecture reflects this, dealing with interactions of sums involving primes whereas Goldbach's conjecture and Lemoine's conjecture deal with such sums only individually. This conjecture and the open questions about numbers at levels two and three are of interest in their own right because of the issues they raise within this fascinating and often baffling additive realm of the prime numbers." ...|$|E
