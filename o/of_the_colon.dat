A colonoscopy allows {{an examination of the}} entire colon (1200–1500mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600mm) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E

25|$|The parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> {{are either}} {{intraperitoneal}} or behind {{it in the}} retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|The cecum is {{the first}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> and {{involved}} in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> not involved in digestion and considered {{to be part of}} the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundVenous {{insufficiency}} {{of a right}} colon interposition in oesophageal reconstruction can be a fatal complication. <b>The</b> right <b>colon</b> segment {{could allow}} restoration of swallowing and speech in reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire oesophagus. <b>The</b> right <b>colon</b> segment {{is a good choice}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large middle colic artery and isoperistaltic direction. However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomical variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veins and the tiny venous network <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>colon,</b> its success rate is lower compared with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>colon</b> segment. Therefore, we devised a simple instrument of transillumination that can provide an improved view during surgery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> venous network <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> and ileocecal region when dissecting this important structure. MethodsThirty-six patients underwent oesophageal reconstruction with a right <b>colon</b> segment using <b>the</b> instrument. <b>The</b> instrument <b>of</b> transillumination was used in all cases while exploring the pedicle vessels and <b>the</b> venous network <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>colon.</b> ResultsNo patients developed complications related to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument. ConclusionThe instrument of transillumination is a simple and useful tool for facilitating dissection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>colon</b> segment.

25|$|All colon surgery {{involves}} {{only three}} maneuvers that may vary in complexity {{depending on the}} region of the bowel {{and the nature of the}} disease. The maneuvers are the retraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> the division of the attachments to the colon and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.|$|E

25|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily digestible pelleted feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, sucralfate, and psyllium to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E
