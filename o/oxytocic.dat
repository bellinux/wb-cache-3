40|$|Management {{options for}} {{postpartum}} hemorrhage (PPH) include <b>oxytocics,</b> prostaglandins, genital tract exploration, ligation or angiographic embolization of uterine/internal iliac arteries, and hysterectomy.

Consenting women had their blood loss measured after normal vaginal delivery and were enrolled in the study after losing more than 500 ml of blood. Women were randomly assigned to receive either 600 mcg sublingual misoprostol or matching placebo in addition to standard PPH treatment with injectable <b>oxytocics.</b> Both women and providers were blinded to the treatment assignment. Blood loss was collected until active bleeding stopped and for a minimum of one hour after PPH diagnosis. Total blood loss, hemoglobin measures, and treatment outcomes were recorded for all participants. Results Due to a much lower rate of PPH than expected (1. 2 %), only sixty-one patients were diagnosed and treated for their PPH in this study, and we were therefore unable to measure statistical significance in any of the primary endpoints. The addition of 600 mcg sublingual misoprostol to standard PPH treatments does, however, suggest a trend in reduced postpartum blood loss, a smaller drop in postpartum hemoglobin, and need for fewer additional interventions. Women who bled less overall had a significantly smaller drop in hemoglobin and received fewer additional interventions. There were no hysterectomies or maternal deaths among study participants. The rate of transient shivering and fever was significantly higher among women receiving misoprostol Conclusion A 600 mcg dose of misoprostol given sublingually shows promise as an adjunct treatment for PPH and its use should continue to be explored for its life-saving potential in the care of women experiencing PPH.

40|$|Postpartum {{haemorrhage}} is {{the leading}} cause of maternal death in the developing world accounting for 30 % of such deaths in areas where maternal mortality is high. Current literature supports active management of the third stage of labour to decrease the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, but which uterotonic drugs is preferable for prophylactic use is still being debated. This study was carried out in the maternity department of the ‘’Hospital Général de Reference Nationale’’ of N’ Djamena, Chad to compare the efficacy of oral and rectal misoprostol to that of syntometrine in the active management of third stage of labour. The study was a large prospective, three arms randomized controlled trial, which included 2400 women. The women were randomly distributed in three groups of 800 each for misoprostol oral 400 μg, misoprostol rectal 400 μg and syntometrine (oxytocin 5 IU + ergometrine 0. 5 mg) 1 vial IM. The primary outcomes were the mean blood loss, incidence postpartum haemorrhage, need of additional <b>oxytocics,</b> mean change in haemoglobin and hematocrit. Secondary outcome included duration of the third stage, manual removal of placenta, blood transfusion, adverse effects (fever, shivering, nausea, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea) and incidence of hypertension. The mean blood loss w as estimated to be 223 ± 142 mL, 232 ± 146 mL, 233 ± 144 mL for syntometrine, misoprostol rectal and oral respectively. Postpartum haemorrhage had occurred in 4. 62 %, 4. 75 % and 4. 75 % of subjects treated with syntometrine, misoprostol rectal and oral respectively. Blood loss > 1000 ml was recorded in 0. 75 %, 0. 75 % and 0. 87 % of subjects treated with syntometrine, misoprostol rectal and oral iv respectively. The mean (±SD) change in haemoglobin level was not significantly different between treatment groups (0. 59 ± 0. 49 g/dl for misoprostol oral, 0. 60 ± 0. 33 g/dl for misoprostol rectal and 0. 55 ± 0. 38 g/dl for syntometrine). There was no significant difference between groups in the duration in third stage of labour, the proportion that required manual removal of placenta or additional <b>oxytocics.</b> Shivering had occurred mainly in the group of oral misoprostol 14. 75 % and rectal misoprostol 8. 75 % compared to syntometrine 4 %. Meanwhile, more subjects who received misoprostol oral and rectal had experienced pyrexia compared to syntometrine: 7. 87 % versus 6. 56 % versus 1. 25 %. Nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension were more frequently in the group of syntometrine. The women and the midwives and doctors in their majority were satisfied with the use of misoprostol (oral or rectal) compared to syntometrine. Misoprostol was less costly than parenteral <b>oxytocics,</b> taken in consideration that it is stable and is not affected by degradation in tropical climates as preparations that contain oxytocin or ergometrine. In conclusion, this comparative study of misoprostol oral and rectal had provided evidences that it is as efficacious as syntometrine in reducing postpartum blood loss and incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, and without the side effects of drugs that contain ergometrine. Our results could have important applications in other areas, such as rural areas and home birthing were access to the immediate management of complications of the third stage of labour might not be readily available...|$|R
