2500|$|Markus was {{captain of}} the winning team at Monte Carlo in 1954 against {{formidable}} opposition {{from all over the}} world: her team-mates were Konstam, Dodds, Reese, Schapiro and [...] "Plum" [...] Meredith. After their victory, Reese and Konstam decided to ask the British selectors to include Markus in their team for the European championships at Montreux that year, but the selectors did not choose her for either the Open or Ladies teams (the reasons are not known). The Open team played with the lesser player Jordanis Pavlides in her place, because their other regular team members such as Pedro Juan were not available. That team won the European and later the Bermuda Bowl trophies. In effect, a bizarre decision by the selectors cost her the European and World teams championships in the <b>Open</b> <b>category.</b> She had other disappointments; this was not the only time she was dropped from the Ladies' team, often when her results were quite outstanding.|$|E

2500|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Mendoza and Palmqvist {{compared}} the habitats and diets of 134 species of living ungulates, for which this data is known, both Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla, against [...] "32 craniodental measurements" [...] {{to discover what}} correlations exist for the group studied and to test hypotheses concerning hypsodonty and mode of life. Habitats considered were open (savanna, deserts), mixed (wooded savanna, brush) and closed (riverine and forest). Diets considered were grazing, mixed grazing and browsing, browsing, omnivory and special niches, such as treetop browsing. Measurements included the Hypsodonty Index (HI) and Muzzle Width (MZW). The results showed that, except for the [...] "high-level" [...] browsers, hypsodonty is correlated to [...] "open and mixed habitats". The HI was not precise enough to discriminate between open and mixed. However, high MZW is correlated to grazing in the <b>open</b> <b>category,</b> although some forest species also have wide muzzles. Grazers therefore are distinguished {{by a combination of}} high-crowned cheek teeth and wide muzzles, both of which are possessed by Elasmotherium. Life in the open is implied.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, {{the term}} [...] "experimental" [...] was often applied by {{conservative}} music critics—along {{with a number}} of other words, such as [...] "engineers art", [...] "musical splitting of the atom", [...] "alchemist's kitchen", [...] "atonal", and [...] "serial"—as a deprecating jargon term, which must be regarded as [...] "abortive concepts", since they did not [...] "grasp a subject" [...] This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions [...] In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a [...] "new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment." [...] He concludes, [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} experimental music … but there is a very real distinction between sterility and invention" [...] Starting in the 1960s, [...] "experimental music" [...] began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, [...] "outsider" [...] composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the [...] "genre's" [...] own definition the work it includes is [...] "radically different and highly individualistic" [...] It is therefore not a genre, but an <b>open</b> <b>category,</b> [...] "because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial" [...] Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance [...] "guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common" [...]|$|E
