40|$|Dream {{speech is}} an understudied area <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> {{research}} worthy <b>of</b> attention for {{its potential to}} shed light {{on the nature of the}} interactions between the dream-self and dream-others, the patterns of discourse that occur among dream characters, and the structure and content <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> speech itself. The history of the study <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> speech is surveyed. Investigation of the structure and content <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> speech points to interesting similarities and differences in waking, imagined, and dreamed speech. Dream speech data support recent evidence that higher-order cognitive activity is a feature <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> no less than of waking thought. The study <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> speech offers a window on understanding dream structure and content more broadly...|$|R
50|$|According to Castaneda {{there are}} 7 Gates <b>of</b> <b>Dreaming,</b> or {{obstacles}} to awareness, which when overcome yield total awareness. Four of the Gates <b>of</b> <b>Dreaming</b> {{are discussed in}} The Art <b>of</b> <b>Dreaming.</b> What follows {{is not so much}} a technique in achieving lucidity, but rather the practical application <b>of</b> lucid <b>dreaming.</b> By acting a certain way while dreaming, one can cause psychosomatic changes in one's being, including an alternate way of dying.|$|R

5|$|Harmonic {{manipulations}} {{of this kind}} {{create a sense of}} standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of detachment, of entering a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm <b>of</b> <b>dreams</b> and memories (if the preceding material is conceived as reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material is conceived as home).|$|E

50|$|Combing early studies, the {{traditional}} symptoms of CWS centered on visual irreminiscence, prosopagnosia, and topographic agnosia. However due to {{significant differences in}} the observations of Charcot and Wilbrand's case work, this syndrome bridged the entire loss <b>of</b> <b>dreaming,</b> whether it be due to the isolated inability of the brain to produce images while asleep as Charcot had dictated, or the complete loss <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> all together as with Wilbrand. This has led to the terming of Charcot and Wilbrand variants, which corresponded to either the loss <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> imagery and visual irreminisence or the complete ceasing <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> experience often coupled with agnosia.|$|R

5|$|The Sandman is a {{comic book}} series written by Neil Gaiman and {{published}} by DC Comics. Its artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel, and Michael Zulli, with lettering by Todd Klein and covers by Dave McKean. Beginning with issue No. 47, it was placed under the Vertigo imprint. It {{tells the story of}} Dream of the Endless, who rules over the world <b>of</b> <b>dreams.</b> The original series ran for 75 issues from January 1989 to March 1996.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of REM sleep as a physiologic correlate <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> {{has created a}} tremendous controversy in psychiatry concerning whether “biologic ” or psycho-analytic theories <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> are correct (Hobson, 1988). It is argued here that neurobiologic and psycho-analytic theories <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> constitute proximate levels of explanation and that an evolutionary approach is needed to provide an ultimate or functional level of explanation {{in order to provide}} a complete theory <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> (Mayr, 1982). The best current functional theories <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> come from the information-processing works of Palombo (1978) and the phylogenetic arguments of Winson (1985), and provide the opportunity for synthesis between neurobiologic and psycho-analytic dream theory.

5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat <b>of</b> <b>Dreams,</b> Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification <b>of</b> <b>dreams.</b> At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|Literary works {{connected}} to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field <b>of</b> <b>Dreams).</b> Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books {{in the field are}} Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered {{a turning point in the}} reporting of professional sports.|$|E

40|$|The central aim of {{this paper}} is to offer a {{historical}} reconstruction of phenomenological studies on dreaming and to put forward a draft for a phenomenological theory <b>of</b> the <b>dream</b> state. Prominent phenomenologists have offered an extremely valuable interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>dream</b> as an intentional process, stressing its relevance in understanding the complexity of the mental life of subject, the continuous interplay between reality and unreality, and the possibility of building parallel spheres of experience influencing the development of personal identity. Taking into consideration the main characteristics <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> experience emphasized by these scholars, in the final part of the paper I propose to elaborate a new phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>dreaming,</b> which should be able to offer a theoretical description <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> states. My sketched proposal is based on Eugen Fink’s notion <b>of</b> the <b>dream</b> as “presentification”. By combining the past and the present of phenomenological investigation, I aim at suggesting a philosophical framework to explain the intentional features <b>of</b> <b>dreaming</b> as Erlebnis...|$|R

5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them came an array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in a den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} of The Sandman is Dream, {{also known as}} Morpheus and other names, {{who is one of}} the seven Endless. The other Endless are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight) and Destruction. The series is famous for Gaiman's trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. The Sandman is a story about stories and how Morpheus, the Lord <b>of</b> <b>Dreams,</b> is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. The Sandman was Vertigo's flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase, in a black-and-white Annotated edition, and is available for digital download.|$|E

5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into Dreams with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title. Before the development of Journey <b>of</b> <b>Dreams,</b> Naka confirmed in retrospective interviews that he had intended to base the next Nights game around a unique motion controller.|$|E
5|$|According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were {{repeatedly}} referenced {{between him}} and Suzuki, {{and that he would}} often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, and that his albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.|$|E
