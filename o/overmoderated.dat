5000|$|In an {{uncontrolled}} {{power excursion}} accident, a sudden power spike in the reactor exceeds reactor design specifications {{due to a}} sudden increase in reactor reactivity. An uncontrolled power excursion occurs due to significantly altering a parameter that affects the neutron multiplication rate of a chain reaction (examples include ejecting a control rod or significantly altering the nuclear characteristics of the moderator, such as by rapid cooling). In extreme cases the reactor may proceed to a condition known as prompt critical. This is especially a problem in reactors that have a positive void coefficient of reactivity, a positive temperature coefficient, are <b>overmoderated,</b> or can trap excess quantities of deleterious fission products within their fuel or moderators. Many of these characteristics {{are present in the}} RBMK design, and the Chernobyl disaster was caused by such deficiencies as well as by severe operator negligence. Western light water reactors are not subject to very large uncontrolled power excursions because loss of coolant decreases, rather than increases, core reactivity (a negative void coefficient of reactivity); [...] "transients," [...] as the minor power fluctuations within Western light water reactors are called, are limited to momentary increases in reactivity that will rapidly decrease with time (approximately 200% - 250% of maximum neutronic power for a few seconds {{in the event of a}} complete rapid shutdown failure combined with a transient).|$|E
40|$|The {{storage of}} nuclear waste in {{underground}} storage facilities presents numerous engineering challenges and risks. Experimental verification of engineered underground storage is impractical or prohibitively expensive, leaving scientists with few options. A 1995 report by Bowman and Venneri of the Los Alamos National Laboratory generated considerable controversy by hypothesizing that wastes composed of fissionable plutonium leached from underground storage containers {{could pose a}} nuclear criticality hazard. They proposed cases where plutonium collected in underground fractures could lead to sustained nuclear fission. In <b>overmoderated</b> cases, they argued that the resulting release of energy from fission could result in steam explosions, or even an underground nuclear explosion (autocriticality). Their hypothesis had {{severe implications for the}} feasibility of long-term nuclear waste storage in geologic repositories. The Bowman and Venneri hypothesis led to the need for a study of conditions {{that could lead to a}} critical event in a geologic repository due to releases of uranium or plutonium. Information about the likely consequences of a critical event is also important in repository design. To accomplish this study a numerical simulation code, GEOCRIT, was written to model radionuclide transport from the repository into a fracture below the repository. Once sufficient material has accumulated in the fracture and rock matrix, the neutronics portion of the code is started to simulate heat generation and fluid flow. The thermohydraulics portion of the code calculates heat generation from fission, stream functions, velocity, and pressure of the fluid in the fracture and rock matrix. The transport portion of the code incorporates numerous parameters that can be varied to simulate different radionuclide buildup in the fracture and rock matrix. Variation of the solubility, diffusion, deposition coefficients in the program yield different accumulations of radionuclides in the fracture and rock matrix. In each case the majority of the deposition occurs in the fracture and adjacent rock matrix. The variation in accumulated radionuclides led to different neutron distributions within the fracture and rock matrix. In each case the largest neutron flux is in the fracture leading to the highest temperature also being within the fracture. The increase in temperature leads to a transient bifurcating flow within the rock matrix. One potential risk for the geological repository is the buildup of radionuclide in the saturated rock with subsequent drying out of the rock matrix. This case is known as overmoderation, whereby the neutron flux increases as the water dries out. It has been hypothesized that certain configurations of radionuclides may be <b>overmoderated</b> and drying out of the water in the rock may lead to a critical event. Three cases of overmoderation were simulated with the code. Three different levels of accumulation of radionuclides within the fracture and rock matrix, with subsequent drying out of the crack, lead to an increase in neutron flux. This increase in neutron flux indicates that the accumulated radionuclide in the saturated fracture and rock matrix is <b>overmoderated.</b> In one of the <b>overmoderated</b> cases, the reactor reached a steady state with transient neutron behavior due to water in the surrounding rock changing from liquid to steam and back. One case shows a significant increase in neutron flux...|$|E
40|$|The OSMOSE program (Oscillation in Minerve of {{isotopes}} in ''Eupraxic'' spectra) is {{a collaboration}} between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Commissariat a l' Energie Atomique (CEA). It aims at measuring integral absorption rates of minor actinides by the oscillation technique in the MINERVE experimental facility located at the CEA Cadarache Research Center. The OSMOSE program also includes a complete analytical program to understand and resolve potential discrepancies between calculated and measured values. The OSMOSE program began in 2001 and will continue until 2013. The Argonne National Laboratory has developed Monte Carlo and deterministic calculation models of the MINERVE facility to determine core and safety parameters such as axial and radial fission rate distributions, control rod worth, spectral indices, and the reactivity worth of oscillated samples. Oscillation samples include calibration samples with different uranium enrichments and boron concentrations and the OSMOSE samples [...] separated actinides including {sup 232 }Th, {sup 233 }U, {sup 234 }U, {sup 235 }U, {sup 236 }U, {sup 238 }U, {sup 237 }Np, {sup 238 }Pu, {sup 239 }Pu, {sup 240 }Pu, {sup 241 }Pu, {sup 242 }Pu, {sup 241 }Am, {sup 243 }Am, {sup 244 }Cm and {sup 245 }Cm. Seven different neutron spectra will be created in the MINERVE facility: an <b>overmoderated</b> UO{sub 2 } matrix (representative of a fuel processing plant or flooded storage cask), a UO{sub 2 } matrix in water (representative of LWRs), a mixed oxide fuel matrix (representative of cores containing MOX fuels), two epithermal spectra (representative of under-moderated reactors), a moderated fast spectrum (representative of fast reactors which have some slowing down due to moderators such as lead-bismuth or sodium), and a very hard spectrum (representative of fast reactors with little moderation from reactor coolant). The different spectra are achieved by changing the experimental lattice within the MINERVE reactor. The currently investigated core configurations are R 1 UO 2 and R 1 MOX, representative of a LWR loaded with UO{sub 2 } and a mixed oxide matrix, respectively. The goal of this report is to synthesize the reactor analysis work performed {{within the framework of}} the OSMOSE program by Argonne National Laboratory until September 2004. The Monte Carlo and deterministic models are detailed, and the calculated safety and core parameters as well as the reactivity worth of the calibration samples are compared with the experimental data for the R 1 UO 2 and R 1 MOX core loadings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{sensitivity analyses}} of the neutronic designs of {{the main components of}} a fission converter-based epithermal neutron beam for neutron capture therapy. Results for the fission converter, the neutron filters and the collimator are presented. In the {{analyses of the}} fast neutron filter/moderator and collimator designs, great emphasis was laid on in-phantom figures of merit using a water-filled ellipsoidal head phantom to evaluate beam performance. In addition, various neutronic calculations required for the engineering design (e. g., reactivity insertion due to the fission converter) were performed. This study intensively employed the general purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) for the analyses. In the sensitivity analysis of the fission converter design, the effect of using different fuel configurations (multi-plate reactor type MITR-II fuel vs. single plate type fuel) was examined with the expectation that the reduced volume fraction of coolant in the single plate fuel fission converter might offset the disadvantage of the H 2 0 coolant which <b>overmoderates</b> a useful portion of the neutron spectrum without commensurate reduction of fast contamination...|$|R
