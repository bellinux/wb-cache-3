5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|Off Kyūshū, a Maldives-registered {{car ferry}} capsized, killing one crew member. A train was derailed, {{possibly}} {{due to a}} tornado, injuring five people. On the island, an electrician in Fukuoka Prefecture died after an industrial container at his firm fell <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> crushing him. A glass entrance of a supermarket in Nobeoka broke on impact with flying debris, killing one person. Elsewhere in the prefecture, a 42-year-old man died in his bedroom when it was crushed, while an elderly woman farmer {{died when she was}} hit by a fallen tree outside a greenhouse. Three other deaths were confirmed on the island.|$|E
5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E

6000|$|Oh! the humiliating {{position}} for an amateur middle-weight champion {{to find himself}} in, with that drink-sodden--Kennard was {{sure that he was}} drink-sodden--consumptive sprawling <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|It fell stone dead <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> One quiver, one {{contraction}} of the claws (in poor Scroope's leg) and all was over. There it lay {{as though it}} were asleep, and underneath was Scroope.|$|R
5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E
5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch a playoff spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching a playoff spot with a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E

60|$|This {{was indeed}} true. The animal, upwards of a yard in length, {{somewhat}} resembled the eel {{in his efforts}} to elude the grasp of man, but Mr Blurt fixed him, coiled him firmly down on his bed of straw and wadding, pressed a similar bed <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> to keep him quiet, and shut the lid.|$|R
5|$|Once the Kongs collect all DK coins, {{they give}} the coins to Funky, who in {{exchange}} gives them a gyrocopter. The duo then finds an enigmatic creature called the Banana Bird Queen, who is bound to a barrier cast by K. Roolenstein. She tells the Kongs that she can only be freed if her separated children are returned to her, and that she will rid the land of K. Rool if she is freed. The Kongs find each of her children in a cave, {{where one of the}} birds is trapped in an egg which hatches when the Kongs complete a Simon-like memory game. After rescuing them and completing a large trade sequence between the Brothers Bear, the Kongs return the children to the Queen. The Queen and her children all sing, annihilating the barrier. The Queen proceeds to chase K. Rool, who is fleeing in a hovercraft. When she catches up to him, she drops a giant eggshell <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> which Dixie and Kiddy land on. The Kongs repeatedly knock on the shell, annoying K. Rool.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and {{the rest}} of the {{excursion}} party attempt to reach the bridge but are repeatedly attacked by the ship's Angel Hosts, androids resembling angels who were programmed to supply information but are now eliminating all passengers and crew. Morvin falls off of a ledge into the ship's engine, {{and the rest}} of the group are surrounded by Angel Hosts. Bannakaffalatta reveals that he is a cyborg, and uses his internal EMP device to disable the Hosts. The EMP burst drains the Zocci's power cells and he dies. Mr. Copper takes the EMP device, saying that if they can manage to recharge it, they can use it against the Hosts again. A lone Angel Host attacks them again, and Foon ties herself to it and throws them both into the ship's engine. The Doctor separates from the rest and attempts to reach Deck 31, where he hopes to find the controls for the Heavenly Hosts. He convinces the Hosts that he is a stowaway - neither passenger nor crew and thus not in the Hosts' kill mandate - and the confused androids take him to see their operator, Max Capricorn. Max explains that he planned the Titanics inevitable collision with Earth to bankrupt the company that voted him out. To save the Doctor, Astrid uses a forklift to ram Max Capricorn and push him into the ship's engine. The forklift falls into the engine <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> seemingly killing Astrid as well.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly John sprang {{in at the}} Roman, {{throwing}} {{himself with}} all his force against him. He partially warded, with his sword, the blow which the Roman struck {{at him as he}} came in; but his weapon was beaten down, and the Roman blade cut through his thick headdress. But the impetus of his spring was sufficient. The Roman, taken by surprise by this sudden attack, tottered, and then fell with a crash, John falling <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hans {{therefore}} {{went down}} alone, {{and began to}} clean out the well, but the men had arranged how they were to act, and immediately each of them seized a stone from a heap of huge blocks, and threw them down above him, thinking to kill him with these. Hans, however, gave no more heed to this than to shout up to them, to keep the hens away from the well, for they were scraping gravel down <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5|$|Skywatch, {{having lost}} control of Ravage and Laserbeak due to {{interference}} from Soundwave, reactivate Grimlock to use against the increasing Transformer activity. Due to Machination sabotage Grimlock escapes and is approached by Scorponok, who proposes an alliance. Grimlock refuses and is out gunned in the battle, but teleports to the Dynobot ship before Scorponok terminates him, still buried after the battle with Shockwave, vowing to bring the Machination down. Skywatch reactivate the other Dynobots, unaware the Machination are manipulating them into killing Grimlock. Finding the Skyfire, the Headmasters attack and manage to teleport Grimlock to Fallon, Nevada, {{in the midst of}} a pitched battle. Skywatch respond by moving in the other Dynobots as both Hot Rod and the combined form of Hunter and Sunstreaker locate the Machination. Hot Rod is almost killed by Scorponok, but kept alive as a witness to the Headmaster's plans. The battle in Fallon devastates the town, but the Dynobots are able to reassert their personalities. Scorponok sends in his Headmaster army as Skywatch head agent Red, now suspicious of the repeated control failures on the Transformers, confers with Shockwave, fitting him with a bomb and directing him to eliminate the Dynobots, Ravage and Laserbeak. In Fallon, the infighting Dynobots manage to fight off the Headmasters with aid from Grimlock's allies the Monsterbots. Hot Rod manages to escape as Sunstreaker and Hunter locate the main Machination facility, while Shockwave locates the stasis locked Soundwave, making a deal with him to deactivate the bomb in his head in return for freeing Soundwave from stasis lock. Sunstreaker saves Hot Rod (who then sends a distress call) but is blasted by Scorponok as the Dynobots and Monsterbots launch a full-scale assault on the Machination. Outclassed by the sheer numbers of Headmasters, they are saved when a grieving Hunter pulls the plug on Sunstreaker's original head, seemingly killing him and disabling the Machination forces. However, a vengeful Scorponok and the newly arrived Shockwave attack as Ultra Magnus, still searching for Scorponok, receives Hot Rod's signal. Shockwave and Scorponok battle each other. The Headmaster loses but Grimlock, finally accepting responsibility for his actions, battles Shockwave, and the other Dinobots aid him. Scorponok is permanently taken out when Hot Rod and Swoop disable his original head. Grimlock brings down the Machination compound <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and Shockwave as Magnus arrives to clean up the situation. Grimlock is arrested along with Shockwave and Scorponok, but the other Dinobots are no longer under suspicion, and repair the Skyfire to leave.|$|E

60|$|Whether he {{were injured}} much or little, none could ever tell. Like enough, {{to judge from}} the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch, was <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.|$|R

[...] "I tell you what, boys: we just {{ought to make}} a watch-night of it--a regular vigil, you know--until twelve at least. Hold on! I'll get up, too!" [...] But here Demorest arose, caught his youthful partner's bare foot which went searching painfully for the ground in one hand, tucked it back under the blankets, and heaping them <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> patted the bulk with an authoritative, paternal air.|$|R
60|$|Before I could answer, I had {{proof of}} this last statement, for the great yellow hound, Pharaoh, that had found us in the desert, hearing our voices, emerged from some corner where it was hidden, and {{advanced}} toward us, wagging its tail. As it passed Shadrach, it stopped and growled, the hair rising on its back, whereon he hurled a stone at it and hit its leg. Next instant Pharaoh, a beast of enormous power, was <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and really, I thought, about to tear out his throat.|$|R

25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E
60|$|Salamander, who {{understood}} well enough {{what he might}} expect, no sooner heard Dougall clambering over the barricade than he gathered himself up for a tremendous wriggle, but received such a fearful squeeze on the neck from the vice-like hand of his captor that he was nearly choked. At the moment a new idea flashed into his fertile brain. His head dropped suddenly to one side; his whole frame became limp, and he fell, as it were, in a heap on the ground, almost bringing the Highlander <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Kemp's face became white. He {{tried to}} grip {{the door handle}} with both hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches. But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide, and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening. His throat was gripped by {{invisible}} fingers, and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself. He was forced back, tripped and pitched heavily {{into the corner of}} the landing. The empty dressing-gown was flung <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Yes, that mild {{youth was}} the {{instrument}} chosen to avert the blow. He chanced {{to be standing}} beside a mass of turf which Okiok had cut from the ground {{for the purpose of}} making a dry seat for Nuna.

Full on the flat face of the drunkard it went, like the wad of a siege-gun, scattering earth and debris all round--and down went the Eskimo. Unable to check himself, down also went Rooney <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{his last}} {{game of the}} season, Newcastle United defender Steven Taylor accidentally landed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> while trying to jump over him, {{breaking}} his ribs.

This was quickly dismissed by both Ljungberg's agents, Claes Elefalk and Scott Duxbury, West Ham's chief executive.|$|E
25|$|As John Curtis let {{his first}} pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed.

25|$|James Braidwood {{was killed}} at the Tooley Street fire of 1861, where a wall {{collapsed}} <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> This fire was {{a major factor in}} the decision of the British government, after much lobbying by liability-laden insurance companies and LFEE, to create the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in 1866. The MFB would be publicly funded and controlled through the Metropolitan Board of Works. Its first superintendent was Captain Sir Eyre Massey Shaw. In 1904, the MFB changed its name to the London Fire Brigade.|$|E
50|$|Revenge, {{like most}} texts, {{is a very}} big role in this text. After the {{physician}} deceives Death time and time again, Death gets very angry and decides to take revenge. When he is about to light a new candle for his godson, he instead snuffs out his current one, causing the physician to die instantly. This is a unique kind of revenge though. Death doesn't just kill his Godson; he first deceives the physician by making him think he is going to get more life. This is possibly a form <b>of</b> payback <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> killing <b>him</b> because the physician deceived Death.|$|R
