40|$|An entity owns an {{interest}} in property and also is a lessee under an operating lease for all or {{a portion of the}} property. Acquisition of an ownership interest in the property and consummation of the lease occurred at or near the same time. This <b>owner-lessee</b> relationship can occur when the entity has an investment in a partnership that owns the leased property. The entity sells its interest or the partnership sells the property to an independent third party and the entity continues to lease the property under the preexisting operating lease. The issues are: 1. Whether the transaction should be accounted for as a sale-leaseback transaction 2. Whether the amount of profit deferred, if any, should be affected by the seller-lessee's prior ownership in the property 3. Whether Statement 98 should be applied to transactions involving property under the scope of that Statement if pursuant to provisions in the preexisting lease, the seller-lessee vacates and intends to sublease the property or exercises a renewal option 4. Whether Statement 98 should be applied to transactions involving property under the scope of that Statement if the preexisting lease is between parties under common control of the seller.
