40|$|Abstract: In {{industrial}} or automotive dip lubricated gear drives, low <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> {{may be used}} due {{to different}} design requirements or constraints. A variation of the sump <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh. Investigations were made in a back-to-back hypoid gear test rig to evaluate the influence of the bath <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> on the scuffing load-carrying capacity of dip lubricated hypoid gears...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The issue under {{discussion}} {{in this paper}} results from a practical task faced with research institutions and manufacturers for gas station equipment, and will {{be divided into two}} parts: 1. In order to observe the impact of storage tank displacement on tank gage table, the author, on the premise of the displacements parameters, to detect the corresponding values of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and volume and analyze the law of change of the tank gage table through modeling and provided a revised tank gage table. The above belongs to direct problem. 2. Based on the data from practical detection, the paper will identify how the displacement occurred and the level of the displacement. Meanwhile, the measure and result of calibration will be offered. All the above belongs to inverse problem. 1. Topic Background Usually, gas stations are equipped with several underground storage tanks for oil, and a corresponding <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> measurement system, through whose flow meter and level meter, can give an updated measurement for such data as volume of oil inflow/outflow and the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the tank according to the tank gage table set beforehand (i. e. the corresponding relationship between height of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and the <b>oil</b> quantity), so as to get changes of the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and quantity...|$|R
40|$|This work is used {{to bridge}} the gap between {{consumer}} and oil supplier by building a smart monitoring system with the help of  ESP 8266 (Wi-Fi module) and  Alexa (Intelligent AI based Virtual Assistant). In the existing system, many oil tanks are inaccessible or buried under the ground. We came up with the solution  of  having a smart monitoring system where there is no longer need to read the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the heating oil tank manually.   It can be done with the help of an ultrasonic sensor. When the consumer requests to check the <b>oil</b> <b>level,</b> ESP 8266  retrieves the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> from the ultrasonic sensor and sends it to Alexa...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop an engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} system that will replace the current dipstick method during vehicle testing for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, Inc. (MBRDNA). Currently, MBRDNA test drivers check the engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> twice a day after two eight hour shifts each day. To measure the <b>oil</b> <b>level,</b> the driver parks on a level surface, waits five minutes for the oil to cool, and then manually checks the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> with the dipstick. The goal of this project {{is to have a}} reliable, physical, working prototype that MBRDNA can use for vehicle testing by spring. MBRDNA wants a prototype built {{by the end of this}} year that is capable of reading <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> without the need of a test driver to measure the oil. It is very easy for a driver to get distracted and forget to check the oil at precisely 5 minutes after the engine has been shut off. This leads to inconsistent results. Drivers are also susceptible to reading the dipstick incorrectly due to the small amount of increments on the end of the dip stick that must be read. Occasionally dipsticks will even break because they are not designed to with stand fatigue loading cycles that are seen during this testing. This leads to an expensive engine tear down to recover broken parts out of the crankcase. The prototype will consist of the following features: a SICK fiber optic cable connected to a SICK optic sensor, a clamp, a microcontroller, a digital display and a data acquisition. This project is being continued from the previous senior project group from 2011 / 2012 academic year...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|R

40|$|Usage of {{multiple}} compressors is applied for general VRF system {{at more than}} 12 HP capacity because {{it is difficult to}} keep capacity and performance by usage of one compressor for such large capacity system. But usage {{of multiple}} compressors has problem controlling cost and keeping <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in each compressor. In this paper, new scroll compressor which can reduce oil circulation in refrigerant circuit, keep <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the compressor, keep high capacity and performance and operate in a wide running range and can be applied until 16 HP capacity by usage of one compressor was developed. It is important to keep <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in a compressor because VRF system has large refrigerant circuit. Analysis of oil and refrigerant flow in the compressor was applied and structure of preventing oil agitation was introduced to reduce oil circulation in refrigerant circuit and keep <b>oil</b> <b>level.</b> The compressor for VRF system is demanded to operate in a wide running range from low speed to high speed and from low load to high load. This compressor can supply oil even if rotational speed is low because this compressor supplies oil by differential pressure and can supply enough oil at low differential pressure by new structure of oil lubrication, therefore running range become wider. And analysis of lubrication between shaft and bearing was applied and this compressor can keep reliability against high load at large capacity by optimal structure...|$|R
