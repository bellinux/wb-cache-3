5|$|Game {{one took}} place at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba, on March 28, 1999. Tickets were {{distributed}} by invitation only. Angelos, Selig, and Castro sat together in box seats. One hundred schoolchildren from the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area also traveled to Cuba on a plane chartered by Angelos. Before the game, players and coaches on both teams engated in a flag ceremony. Castro greeted the Orioles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> gave his Cuban team a pep talk. Cuban baseball legend Conrado Marrero threw out the first pitch.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's skill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> {{positive}} influence on other team members led to his emergence, early in 2007, as a future candidate for the Broncos captaincy. Broncos chief executive Bruno Cullen stated that {{such a move would}} have his and the Broncos management's full support. Current captain Lockyer also gave his support to Hunt being the next captain, saying that he has the respect of fellow players and the necessary leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|In early cricket, {{there were}} two umpires as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was {{required}} to touch in order to complete his run. There were two scorers who sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.|$|E

5|$|In {{their second}} game in three days, the Panhandles played against the Youngstown Patricians. It was a low-scoring, 2–0 loss. The lone score {{came from a}} safety in the second quarter. The Panhandles were about to punt, but it was blocked. The ball landed in the end zone, and a Panhandle player landed on the ball. According to the Youngstown Vindicator, the football's {{condition}} was damaged due to the water <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> several fumbles occurred throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before dawn}} on December 14, {{ammunition}} was issued and the 22nd moved forward slightly, {{to about the}} position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before. Here they spent another day pinned to the ground, unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen. Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> the 22nd retired {{to the city of}} Fredericksburg.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E

5|$|While the Stallions {{experienced}} a successful year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> finished second to Edmonton in average attendance, the city's excitement of 1994 died down. Attendance declined, with season ticket sales dropping to around 17,000. Later reports suggested that attendance numbers had been inflated by giveaways {{and the team}} projected some losses in 1995. Despite these difficulties, the Stallions remained the model that lent expansion credibility; other American owners looked to Baltimore in deciding {{on the future of}} their own teams.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> {{in the front office}} were expected during the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 196566 Ashes series while regular captain Bob Simpson was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace or off spin. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge spin bowlers. Booth {{was known for his}} sportsmanship <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group of}} {{personnel}} started attacking people working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> {{those who were}} trying to escape were captured and shot dead. The attack continued for another six hours. At 2.00 pm, the military loaded the bodies onto its vehicles and transported them away to the Thalladi camp. Villagers attest that 52 people were killed and at least 40 more sustained grievous injuries.|$|R

5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E
5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E
5|$|Several lesser known {{moments in}} the rivalry {{occurred}} during the 1930s. Pitcher Red Ruffing was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, {{would go on to}} a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning 6 World Series with them. On August 12, 1934, then the largest crowd in the history of Fenway Park, 46,766, witnessed Babe Ruth's final game at Fenway Park in a Yankees uniform in a game Boston would lose. A year later, the crowd record would be broken again when the two teams met again on September 22, 1935. Record crowds would also show up at Yankee Stadium. On May 30, 1938, before 83,533 spectators, Yankees outfielder Jake Powell and Red Sox player-manager Joe Cronin fought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> beneath the stands. Both players were fined and suspended for 10 games. The Yankees and Red Sox would finish first and second in the League respectively that year as well as the following. The Yankees went on to sweep the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series a year later.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees won the World Series {{every year}} from 1936 to 1939 with a team that {{featured}} Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times from 1955 to 1964. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> the team became a money-loser for owners CBS while playing in an aging stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping {{to make more money}} that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with {{the fact that most of}} the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E
