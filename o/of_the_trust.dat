30|$|Each trusted {{application}} exposes a TA interface.

Once <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework has called one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TA entry points, the TA can make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TEE internal API to access <b>the</b> facilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> OS. <b>The</b> TEE internal API consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trusted</b> core framework API, trusted storage API for data and keys, cryptographic operations API, time API, and TEE arithmetical API [19].

5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trust,</b> which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects {{that had been}} taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even admit that they had these objects was a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense.|$|E

Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller {{began to think of}} retirement. The daily management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E
