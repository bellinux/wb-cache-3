5|$|The Tempest {{has only}} one female character, Miranda. Other women, such as Caliban's mother Sycorax, Miranda's mother and Alonso's {{daughter}} Claribel, are only mentioned. Because of the small role women play in the story in comparison to other Shakespeare plays, The Tempest has attracted much feminist criticism. Miranda is typically viewed as being completely deprived of freedom by her father. Her only duty in his eyes is to remain chaste. Ann Thompson argues that Miranda, in a manner typical of women in a colonial atmosphere, has completely internalised the patriarchal <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> thinking of herself as subordinate to her father.|$|E

25|$|The Methodist {{movement}} in the United States {{as a whole was}} not of one voice on the subject of slavery.

That in later times he was not termed a heretic, although disparaging criticism was not lacking, was due to his position as gaon (see Weiss, l.c. iv. 198; Menahem Me'iri, Bet ha-Beḥirah, in Adolf Neubauer, M.

50|$|The {{heritage}} of Greek mythology already embodied {{the desire to}} articulate reality as a whole, and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> being was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought. Hesiod, impressed by necessity governing the <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> discloses a definite pattern in the genesis and appearance of the gods. These ideas made something like cosmological speculation possible. The earliest rhetoric of reflection all centers about two interrelated things: the experience of wonder as a living involvement with the divine <b>order</b> <b>of</b> things; and the absolute conviction that, beyond the totality <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> reality forms a beautiful and harmonious whole.|$|R
25|$|As slavery {{disputes}} intensified in the 19th century, there emerged two doctrines {{within the}} Methodist Church. Churches in the South were primarily proslavery, while northern churches started antislavery movements. The apologia of the Southern churches was largely based in Old Testament scriptures, which often represent slavery {{as a part}} of the natural <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> New Testament writings were sometimes used to support the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of Paul, especially in Ephesians, instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology also argued that slavery was beneficial for slaves, as well as their owners, saying that they were offered protections from many ills because of their slavery.|$|E
25|$|In 1252 Abel {{suddenly}} {{died during}} {{an expedition to}} Friesland leaving the kingdom without a leader. The natural <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> would be to elect Valdemar as king but this seemed a poor choice since he was preoccupied in a prison cell in Cologne. This prompted the pragmatic election of Abel's brother, Christoffer I, as the new king. Valdemar was released one year later when his family had finally succeeded to collect the funds for his ransom. Upon his return to Denmark Valdemar immediately challenged Christoffer for the throne but found little support. It was finally agreed that Valdemar would become Duke of Schleswig. This not being the optimal outcome for Valdemar several wars between the king of Denmark and the Duke of Schleswig ensued until it was finally decided to build a fortress to defend the southern borders against its troublesome neighbour.|$|E

500|$|The largest {{effect on}} the {{continental}} tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the theoretical attitude in general which of course includes the scientific attitude. [...] For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical {{of the importance of}} science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, {{there have been a number}} of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, Alexandre Koyré. [...] Another important development was that of Michel Foucault's analysis of the historical and scientific thought in The <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> and his study of power and corruption within the [...] "science" [...] of madness. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include Jürgen Habermas (e.g., [...] "Truth and Justification", 1998), Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and Wolfgang Stegmüller ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).|$|E

500|$|The European {{coronation}} ceremonies of the Middle Ages {{were essentially}} {{a combination of}} the Christian rite of anointing with additional elements. Following Europe's conversion to Christianity, crowning ceremonies became more and more ornate, depending on the country in question, and their Christian elements—especially anointing—became the paramount concern. Crowns and sceptres, used in coronations since ancient times, took on a Christian significance together with the orb as symbols of the purported divine <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> with the monarch as the divinely ordained overlord and protector of his dominion. During the Middle Ages, this rite was considered so vital in some European kingdoms that it was sometimes referred to as an [...] "eighth sacrament". The anointed ruler was viewed as a mixta persona, part priest and part layman, but never wholly either. This notion persisted into the twentieth century in Imperial Russia, where the Tsar was considered to be [...] "wedded" [...] to his subjects through the Orthodox coronation service.
