60|$|Mr. ------ led {{me through}} a spacious old room, which was {{formerly}} panelled with carved oak, but which is converted into a brew-house, {{up a pair of}} stairs, into the garret of one of the gables, in order to show me the ancient framework of the house. It is of oak, and preposterously ponderous,--immense beams and rafters, which no modern walls could support,--a gigantic old skeleton, which architects say must have stood a thousand years; and, indeed, it is impossible to ascertain the date of the original foundation, though it is known to have been repaired and restored between five and six centuries ago. Of course, in the lapse of ages, it must continually have been undergoing minor changes, but without at all losing its identity.

60|$|There seems {{hardly any}} one on board but ourselves: we {{alone on the}} little {{promenade}} deck. Strangely lonely, floating on a bare old ship past the great bare shores, on a rolling sea, stooping and rising in the wind. The wood of the fittings is all bare and weather-silvered, the cabin, the seats, even the little lions of the seats. The paint wore away long ago: and this timber will never see paint any more. Strange to put one's hand on the old oaken wood, so sea-fibred. Good old delicate-threaded oak: I swear it grew in England. And everything so carefully done, so solidly and everlastingly. I look at the lions, with the perfect-fitting oaken pins through their paws clinching them down, and their little mouths open. They are as solid {{as they were in}} Victorian days, as immovable. They will never wear away. What a joy in the careful, thorough, manly, everlasting work put into a ship: at least into this sixty-year-old vessel. Every bit of this <b>old</b> <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> so sound, so beautiful: and the whole welded together with joints and wooden pins far more beautifully and livingly than iron welds. Rustless, life-born, living-tissued old wood: rustless as flesh is rustless, and happy-seeming as iron never can be. She rides so well, she takes the sea so beautifully, as a matter of course.|$|E
60|$|Descending {{from the}} ramparts, {{we went into}} the Armory, which I did not see on my former visit. The {{superintendent}} of this department is an old soldier of very great intelligence and vast communicativeness, and quite absorbed in thinking of and handling weapons; for he is a practical armorer. He had few things to show us that were very interesting,--a helmet or two, a bomb and grenade from the Crimea; also some muskets from the same quarter, one of which, with a sword at the end, he spoke of admiringly, as the best weapon in the collection, its only fault being its extreme weight. He showed us, too, some Minie rifles, and whole ranges of the old-fashioned Brown Bess, which had helped to win Wellington's victories; also the halberts of sergeants now laid aside, and some swords that had been used at the battle of Sheriffmuir. These latter were very short, not reaching to the floor, when I held one of them, point downward, in my hand. The shortness of the blade and consequent closeness of the encounter must have given the weapon a most dagger-like murderousness. Ranging in the hall of arms, there were two tattered banners that had gone through the Peninsular battles, one of them belonging to the gallant 42d Regiment. The armorer gave my wife a rag from each of these banners, consecrated by so much battle-smoke; also a piece of old oak, half burned to charcoal, which had been rescued from the panelling of the Douglas Tower. We saw better things, moreover, than all these rusty weapons and ragged flags; namely, the pulpit and communion-table of John Knox. The frame of the former, if I remember aright, is complete; but {{one or two of the}} panels are knocked out and lost, and, on the whole, it looks as if it had been shaken to pieces by the thunder of his holdings forth,--much worm-eaten, too, is the <b>old</b> <b>oak</b> <b>wood,</b> as well it may be, for the letters MD (1500) are carved on its front. The communion-table is polished, and in much better preservation.|$|E

60|$|The churchyard I {{like best}} is {{situated}} in the village itself, and is in use both for the dead and living, and the playground of the little ones, but some time ago I by chance discovered one which was over {{half a mile from}} the village; an ancient beautiful church and churchyard which so greatly attracted me that in my rambles in that part I often went a mile or two out of my way just for the pleasure of spending an hour or two in that quiet sacred spot. It was in a wooded district in Hampshire, and there were <b>old</b> <b>oak</b> <b>woods</b> all round the church, with no other building in sight and seldom a sound of human life. There was an old road outside the gate, but few used it. The tombs and stones were many and nearly covered with moss and lichen and half-draped in creeping ivy.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find scientific arguments in favour of reusing recovered oak wood in order to reintegrate it in new types of structures. For this study six beams were selected, which had been recovered from a house built in 1831. Visual analysis revealed several defects and signs of degradation in the sapwood and inside the cracks. The recovered beams hadn’t been treated with any toxic chemicals. Bending strength, modulus of elasticity and compression strength parallel to the grain were investigated and microscopy and FTIR-ATR spectroscopy were used to check the quality of the apparently sound beam areas also used for the determination of mechanical properties. Macroscopic and microscopic analysis may not reveal any incipient fungal attack but FTIR analysis was proven to be effective. The obtained results open a new perspective for the future use of recovered <b>old</b> <b>oak</b> <b>wood,</b> due to the adequate mechanical properties and to the assumed means of eliminating degraded areas...|$|E

The house, with gable and chimney, and tower, and turret, and dark doorway, and broad terrace-walk, twining among the balustrades of which, and lying heaped upon the vases, there was one great flush of roses, seemed scarcely real in its light solidity and in the serene and peaceful hush that rested on all around it.

40|$|Eight {{samples of}} ca. 3000 year <b>old</b> <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> from the Biskupin site {{and a piece}} of sound oak (Quercus sp.) wood were analysed. The {{degradation}} state of archaeological oak wood was investigated using two analytical approaches: classical wet chemical analysis and analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with in situ silylation. The results were compared with those obtained for sound oak wood. Chemical analysis provided information on the amount of wood components. Their alteration at a molecular level was investigated by Py-GC/MS, highlighting how degradation can affect the formation of primary and secondary wood pyrolysis products. The results showed that the chemical changes in the wood material in the eight samples examined had different entities and extents with comparison to sound oak wood. Samples taken from the external parts of the fragments had undergone a significant loss in polysaccharide components, whereas the internal parts were in a relatively good state of preservation. Evaluation of the relative amounts of pyrolysis products deriving from holocellulose and lignin highlighted that specific categories of compounds, such as lignin monomers and anhydrosugars, can be taken as an index for good preservation of wood components. These results will be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the in situ conservation strategy by repeating the analyses on these samples after some years and comparing the results...|$|E

Jones' exhibition Liminal (2000) (www. recirca. com/backissues/c 93 /belfast. shtml) indicates previous engagement with similar themes and the paper 'Between a Flashing Star and a Gravestone: sleepers, liminality and communal dreaming' 2004 on the AHRC funded website 'Imaginal Regions' (www. imaginalregions. co. uk) defines the academic research context for sleepers. The concept developed out of Jones' research and current investigations into liminal states and was prompted {{by a desire to}} reclaim the reclining body from a surveyed, passive, feminised and objectified position by characterising the sleeper in an active role as the one who dreams the world into being and who lies dormant, full of potential. 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' are mediaeval romances focusing on the theme of ideal love, but their origins are in earlier folklore where the sleeper, who can be male or female, is a being that embodies the land and acts as its protector or guardian. By inviting people to become a sleeper, Jones provoked a shift in perspective from the sleeper as object to the sleeper as subject with multiple possibilities for becoming.

40|$|Background and Aims : During ageing in oak barrels, wine {{undergoes}} changes {{because of}} the release of polyphenols and other molecules from wood. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of some oak wood-derived volatile compounds, ellagic acid and <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> extracts on the levels of (+) -catechin, procyanidin B 1 and malvidin- 3 -glucoside. Methods and Results : Phenolics and the <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> derived volatile compounds studied were quantified by HPLC and by GC, respectively. Additionally, the new compounds formed in the solutions were characterised by their spectral properties. Ellagic acid and/or <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> extracts slowed the decline in the levels of (+) -catechin and procyanidin B 1. In contrast, the decrease in malvidin- 3 -glucoside was more pronounced in the presence of ellagic acid and <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> chip extracts. Furfural slowed (+) -catechin degradation, while breakdown of malvidin- 3 -glucoside was slightly more pronounced in the presence of guaiacol, furfural, vanillin and eugenol. (+) -Catechin, procyanidin B 1 and malvidin- 3 -glucoside did not significantly affect the rate of the degradation of ellagitannins during the storage time studied. Finally, new HPLC peaks were detected in the solutions containing (+) -catechin and ellagic acid, as well as with malvidin- 3 -glucoside with ellagic acid and <b>oak</b> <b>wood</b> extract.
