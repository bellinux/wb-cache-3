40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this article is}} the undeniable experience <b>of</b> conscious <b>willing</b> despite its rejection by scientific research. The article starts a phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> {{at the level of the}} (epi) phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> itself, without assuming its embeddedness in a faculty of the soul, consciousness and so forth. After the introduction, a brief history of the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> is provided, from which the paradoxical conclusion is drawn that, according to phenomenologists like Heidegger and his followers, the dominance <b>of</b> the <b>will</b> is the main characteristic of the current age, whereas scientists deny the existence <b>of</b> a conscious <b>will</b> at all. Then, four structural moments of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> are explored in contrast to traditional characterizations in order to rehabilitate and appreciate the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>willing</b> in contemporary philosophy: the interconnectedness of the one who wills and that which is willed, the transcendence and demand character of that which is <b>willed,</b> the self-involvement <b>of</b> the one who wills and the ampliative nature of the act <b>of</b> <b>willing.</b> To this end, not only sources from the phenomenological tradition but also the affordance theory of the ecological psychologist James Gibson are critically discussed...|$|R

5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute <b>of</b> <b>Wills,</b> many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E

A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register <b>of</b> <b>Wills</b> as an independently elected official.|$|E

5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 3, 1953, {{was the second}} held under the city charter of 1951 and represented the first test of the Democratic city government of Mayor Joseph S.

They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with Democrats for district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, the voters had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to block it in the election for City Controller, Register <b>of</b> <b>Wills,</b> and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all their candidates citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once-powerful Philadelphia Republican machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> {{is considered}} to be the crucial principle controlling all private relationships of human life. People in the sense of individuals of private law have opportunity to form their private relationships according to their free will thanks to the autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will,</b> even while within certain predetermined limits. The principle <b>of</b> autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> is closely related to the principle of non-mandatory rule in private law and to the principle of equality, the principle of pacta sunt servanda and to the principle according to a person acts lawfully unless there is a legal rule prohibiting or curtailing that behaviour. The purpose of my thesis is to classify the term autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> in its historical context and its definition in the context of other principles and institutions of private law. The importance of this principle is further illustrated by the specific expressions autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> in our legal system. My thesis is composed of a general part and a special part. The general part is divided into three chapters. Chapter One deals with the historical appearance <b>of</b> autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> from ancient times to modern history, ie from primary manifestations <b>of</b> autonomy <b>of</b> <b>will</b> in the contractual relationships of people to its international establishment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to argue for libertarian freedom on the basis <b>of</b> {{weakness}} <b>of</b> <b>will</b> as a common possibility for human agents. The phenomenon <b>of</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>will</b> is widely acknowledged as a human possibility. Few contemporary philosophers, however, are proponents of libertarian freedom. I argue first that the possibility <b>of</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>will</b> is implied by human agency. I then describe several sets of conditions philosophers have proposed to explain the apparent freedom necessary for weakness <b>of</b> <b>will</b> and show that one proposal seems more adequate than the rest. The proposal I argue for is that the freedom needed for weakness <b>of</b> <b>will</b> is the freedom to act on a resistible desire. Acting on a resistible desire is then defined and defended. I provide two ways of looking at acting on a resistible desire and show why one of these is more promising than the other. In conclusion I show that two contemporary compatibilist approaches to describing freedom conditions fail to work in the context <b>of</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>will</b> and show that the freedom condition I have proposed works better. On the basis of these results I claim that all compatibilist freedom conditions will fail in similar ways. I claim, then, that libertarian freedom is the freedom necessary for weakness <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> ...|$|R
