40|$|Dispute {{resolution}} {{under the}} <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act 2006 (Vic) requires <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (formerly known as bodies corporate) {{to engage in}} a form of dispute resolution prior to litigation being brought to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. In this article, the authors discuss the legislation and policy approach informing the aim of encouraging early conflict engagement in disputes in <b>owners</b> <b>corporations.</b> The authors report on selected results from research into the experience of <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> disputes from the perspective of managers and <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> committees. The authors argue that the legislation is necessary given the wider use of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> in developments and the likelihood of conflict occurring in legal entities holding communal assets in apartment complexes, medium density housing and master planned estates. However, the data shows that <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> managers and committees require education in conflict resolution strategies to more effectively engage in early dispute resolution as envisaged under the Act. This article outlines a training regime to provide conflict resolution skills and strategies to <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> managers and committees...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act 2006, which {{provides}} for the management, powers and functions of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (formerly body corporates), and mechanisms to resolve disputes. Background The {{focus of this}} issues paper is the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act 2006, which provides for the management, powers and functions of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (formerly body corporates), and mechanisms to resolve disputes. The paper examines issues regarding: 	the function and operation of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (except {{for the conduct of}} <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> managers, which forms part of Issues paper 1 : Conduct and institutional arrangements) 	Part 5 of the Subdivision Act 1988, which provides for the creation of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations,</b> the vesting of and dealings in the common property, and the alteration of subdivisions 	the interaction between the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act and the Retirement Villages Act 1986. Consultation on these issues will form part of a staged review of certain aspects of the Retirement Villages Act. The <b>Owners</b> <b>corporations</b> issues paper looks at whether these Acts are achieving their purposes and, in doing so, whether they are also achieving their informal purpose of improving the ‘liveability’ of strata communities. Throughout the paper, issues have been raised for consideration and comment. Many have been raised by stakeholders during preliminary consultation for the Consumer property law review. The issues paper does not attempt to provide data or evidence to substantiate the issues raised. Its purpose is to draw out evidence and commentary from stakeholders {{about the nature of the}} issue and extent of any problems. Feedback on this issues paper will inform the development of an options paper on potential legislative changes, which will be released in mid- 2016. Submissions on the options paper will inform the government in determining final legislative reforms...|$|R
40|$|An <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> is {{the legal}} entity in Victoria that holds jointly owned assets in housing {{developments}} such as apartments, medium density townhouses and master planned estates. In Victoria, the legislation governing these entities is the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act 2006 and specific sections of the Subdivision Act 1988. Conflicts in <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> are not uncommon and the <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> or strata managers may informally mediate disputes. This article will outline research into the experience of conflict in <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> {{from the perspective of}} strata managers and discuss mediator ethics in this context. Managers, as informal &# 039;insider&# 039; mediators, may experience a number of ethical dilemmas, most notably the issue of impartiality/ neutrality. They are part of a growing group of mediators that operate outside of the National Mediation Accreditation System. The article suggests the need for a community of practice of managers who informally mediate so that ethical concerns in their specific context can be shared and debated...|$|R

40|$|Conflict {{occurring}} in apartment buildings, medium-density housing and master planned estates, {{is an important}} issue as use of strata title in developments grows in Australia. Strata title developments consist of individual lots and are founded on a legal structure where some shared, or common, areas and services are jointly owned. In Victoria, the legal entity holding shared assets is known as the <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> and the legislation that regulates ownership of shared assets is the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporation</b> Act 2006. This legislation provides a three tier or step dispute resolution scheme for conflict that arises in strata developments. In the first tier of internal dispute resolution the regulations provide model rules of dispute resolution. This article reports on research into dispute resolution under the Act, and in particular into the effectiveness of the model rules. The research was conducted in Victoria in 2011, gathering data from a range of key stakeholders in <b>owners</b> <b>corporations,</b> including 34 property managers of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (known commonly as &# 039;strata managers&# 039;). This article reports on the range of conflict experienced by the property managers who participated in this study. Analysis of the data provided by the property managers shows that difficulties with conflict and the model rules for dispute resolution under the Act were most evident in small and high-rise apartment buildings. The most satisfied with the model rules were managers in medium sized <b>owners</b> <b>corporations.</b> Whilst a majority of managers used the model rules, over a third used their own informal rules. These findings lead the authors to argue {{that there is a need}} for differentiated rules for dispute resolution dependent upon size of the development. Additionally, there are a number of informal rules being used that it would be valuable to research to ascertain their effectiveness and to provide <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> with added choice in dispute resolution...|$|R

Introduction On Wednesday 8 October 2014, in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporation</b> Strata Plan 612881 (Brookfield) the High Court held that a builder of a strata-titled serviced apartment building did not owe a duty of care to the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporation</b> to take reasonable care to avoid purely economic loss arising from latent defects in the building’s construction. The builder was therefore not liable in negligence to the <b>Owners</b> <b>Corporation.</b> This e-brief provides {{a summary of}} the High Court decision and the stakeholder reaction to it. It also explores the possible relationship between the decision and the amendments to the Home Building Act 1989 which are about to come into force...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a legal decision support guide for <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> cases in the state of Victoria, Australia that uses an OWL ontology and Bayesian Network to perform legal reasoning. The rate of growth of <b>owners</b> <b>corporations</b> (also known as body corporate or strata title properties) has increased significantly in the last two decades. Because of this growth, and the need to manage a rapidly expanding population, the governance and management of these entities has become an important concern for government. Conflict and its management within them is an essential element of this concern. Cases that can’t be settled through negotiation are often referred to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Using an OWL ontology we have systematically modeled legal arguments and outcomes of past cases heard by VCAT to facilitate both stand alone and Web based information retrieval, extraction and case based reasoning. A Bayesian Belief network is also used to deal with assumptions that tend to be prevalent in commonsense reasoning. Through our system we aim to provide negotiation decision support to help guide <b>owners</b> <b>corporation</b> disputants through the grievance process...|$|R
