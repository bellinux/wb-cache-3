25|$|Libertine Grimm {{is another}} gothic {{character}} who {{is actually an}} amalgam of many different women. She is sexy, erudite and possessed of an extraordinary wit, but this is counterbalanced by an unhealthy appetite for self-destruction and flights of morbid fancy, brought on by dark secrets, terribly chic drugs and wild, sexual abandonment. She is a gluttonous Miss Muffet; the fairy-tale girl who ate the Big Bad Wolf; and the beauty who slept with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the coming talent. Libertina Grimm is every goth girl's coven mistress.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} team composing Vietnamese natives {{began to be}} assembled, drawing mainly from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Sport. Several members of the squad had previous experience in baseball (also a relatively new sport {{in this part of}} the world) and two had previously played on the Vietnam national baseball team. The team began playing in the VCA league to gain experience, which had previously been expat-only. Their coach was Australian expat Mick Blinkhoff. By early 2017, in preparation for the SEA Games in August, the national squad members were training five days a week and got a government stipend of VND5 million per week (INR14,148; USD219.5; GBP171.35). The VCA already has <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the 2021 Southeast Asian Games, hosted in Hanoi.|$|E

500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> his chest and a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
500|$|Rosas {{failed to}} realize that discontent was {{steadily}} growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at {{his right hand and}} became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: [...] "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; he goes in constant fear and always has <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night".|$|E

2500|$|These {{failures}} {{provoked the}} Commons to refuse further levies of taxation to fund Buckingham's extravagant adventures, {{while at the}} same time the duke was accused of being enraptured by intrigues; of dealing a blow to the international Catholic conspiracy. [...] Yet even before they set sail the food was consumed awaiting the Board of Ordnance to deliver the cannonry and musket balls. [...] On this occasion the Lord Admiral was not in command. [...] The experienced admirals were unavailable, so it fell to the newly created Viscount Wimbledon to lead the expedition with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> history; to repeat the actions of Sir Francis Drake by seizing the main Spanish port at Cádiz and burning the fleet in its harbour.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin {{was part}} of Mission Boston on D-Day. This was a {{parachute}} combat assault conducted at night by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on June 6, 1944, {{as part of the}} American airborne landings in Normandy. The intended objective was to secure an area of roughly [...] {{on either side of the}} Merderet River. They were to capture the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, a crucial communications crossroad behind Utah Beach, and to block the approaches into the area from the west and southwest. They were to seize causeways and bridges over the Merderet at La Fière and Chef-du-Pont, destroy the highway bridge over the Douve River at Pont l'Abbé (now Étienville), and secure the area west of Sainte-Mère-Église to establish a defensive line between Gourbesville and Renouf. Gavin was to describe the operation as having two interrelated challenges – it had to be 'planned and staged with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> deception and one on the assault'.|$|E

2500|$|The Oxford Canal was {{originally}} {{built as a}} contour canal, meaning that it twisted around hills to minimise vertical deviations from a level contour. However, with <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the developing railway network, in the 1820s the northern section of the canal between Braunston and Hawkesbury Junction was straightened out to reduce navigation time. This work reduced the distance by 14miles 6furlongs (23.7km). The section south of Napton was never straightened. The straightening challenged the capacity of three locks at Hillmorton, the first on the canal after the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction. The solution to the congestion was to duplicate or twin the existing locks at Hillmorton, creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks, which allowed for twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time. The work to double the locks was completed in August 1840. Not only was the capacity to pass the lock doubled, but the time taken was decreased as the locks were narrower. Tests showed that the locks could be operated {{in as little as}} one minute and 20 seconds! ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 saw Keating’s side {{taken on}} Limerick in their opening game. [...] It {{was a game}} that Tipp were {{expected}} to win, however, Limerick put up a good fight and the game ended in a draw. [...] For the replay of the game Keating made the drastic move of dropping legendary goalkeeper Brendan Cummins. [...] The second game saw Keating’s side lead by ten points at one stage, however, {{by the end of}} the seventy minutes both sides were level once again. [...] A period of extra-time failed to separate these two sides were forced to meet for a third time. [...] Once again extra-time had to be played, however, after nearly four hours of hurling Limerick emerged as the winners. [...] After the defeat Keating looked less than impressed when he was forced to do a television interview alongside ecstatic Limerick manager Richie Bennis. [...] The All-Ireland qualifiers saw Keating’s side win all of their games, including a victory over Cork for the first time since 1991. [...] It looked as if Tipp had come out on the easy side of the draw as their opponents, Wexford, were not regarded as being up to much. [...] Because of this Keating may have been guilty of having <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> the All-Ireland semi-final. [...] His decision to relegate star forward Eoin Kelly to the substitutes bench baffled many, particularly since Kelly tops the chart as Tipp’s all-time top scorer. [...] The game itself was an exciting one, however, a Damien Fitzhenry penalty sealed the victory for Wexford and dumped Tipp out of the championship. [...] Keating resigned as manager shortly after this defeat.|$|E

2500|$|Flatfish are {{an order}} of ray-finned benthic fishes which lie flat on the ocean floor. Examples are flounder, sole, turbot, plaice, and halibut. The adult fish of many species have both <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side of the head. When the fish hatches, <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> is located <b>on</b> each side of its head. But as the fish grows from the larval stage, <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> migrates {{to the other side}} of the body as a process of metamorphosis. [...] The {{flatfish}} then changes its habits, and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor with both eyes facing upwards. The side to which <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> migrates depends <b>on</b> the species; with some species both <b>eyes</b> are ultimately <b>on</b> the left side, whereas with other species the <b>eyes</b> are <b>on</b> the right.|$|R
