5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like {{the time needed to}} get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected <b>operational</b> <b>lifetime</b> of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{distributed}} feedback (DFB) lasers with gratings imprinted by thermal {{nanoimprint lithography}} on the active film are reported. They show thresholds for lasing of ∼ 10 kW/cm 2, {{similar to the}} most efficient imprinted DFB lasers reported; and long <b>operational</b> <b>lifetimes</b> (under ambient conditions) of ∼ 12 × 104 pump pulses. The key for their successful operation has been {{the selection of a}} highly efficient and stable dye, perylene orange (PDI-O), and a proper matrix to host it, the fluoro-modified thermoplastic resist mr-I 7030 R, which has enabled 2 D imprinting while preserving the dye optical properties. The use of the UV-curable resist SU 8 as an alternative matrix for PDI-O to be imprinted by combined nanoimprint and photolithography was also investigated, and was concluded to be unsuccessful due to severe photoluminescence quenching. By replacing PDI-O with Rhodamine 6 G, lasers with reasonable thresholds, but with significantly inferior <b>operational</b> <b>lifetimes</b> in comparison to PDI-O/mr-I 7030 R devices, were obtained.
