5|$|A weather ship, or <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Vessel,</b> was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

The weather patrols (later termed [...] "ocean station patrols") consisted of sailing for three weeks on assigned stations in the Pacific, and each cutter assigned performed four or five such patrols each year. Their primary task was to report meteorological information, which was used in weather forecasts for the burgeoning trans-Pacific commercial air traffic {{as well as for}} surface <b>vessels.</b> The <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> <b>vessels</b> also provided communications and navigation assistance and were always standing by for search and rescue emergencies.

5000|$|The ocean-weather station {{program was}} {{permanently}} established by multi-national agreement {{soon after the}} end of World War II. The Coast Guard was then assigned the duty of manning those stations for which the U.S. accepted responsibility. As the 327s completed conversion to <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> <b>vessels,</b> each immediately deployed to their new stations. For most of the next twenty years, Duane and her sisters, except [...] which was stationed in the Pacific, alternated duty between weather stations [...] "Charlie" [...] (850 miles northeast of St. Johns, Newfoundland), [...] "Bravo" [...] (250 miles northeast of Cape St. Charles, Labrador); [...] "Delta" [...] (located 650 miles southeast of Argentia, Newfoundland); and [...] "Echo" [...] (850 miles east northeast of Bermuda). Sometime later these became known simply as [...] "ocean stations." [...] Although the crew probably considered these patrols boring, they were important to the continued growth and safety of international over-water commercial air flights. On 1 May 1965 all the vessels in her class were re-classified as high endurance cutters and she was redesignated WHEC-33.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe increasing interest {{in long term}} (inter-annual) weather changes and their relation to processes in the ocean is beginning to illuminate the need for {{and the lack of}} long term records of physically significant variables which occur over the vast oceanic regions of the northern hemisphere. An attempt is made here to evaluate the accuracy of a hind cast time series of surface wind vector components and speeds for the period of January 1960 through December 1969. The quasi-geostrophic model used to calculate these records is described as well as the twelve-hourly surface pressure data which were used as input. The central moments of the probability distributions of the computed records are compared to those of corresponding time series observed on <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Vessels.</b> Linear correlation coefficients between observed and computed records were found to average 0. 81 for the components of the wind vector and 0. 65 for the wind speed. Regression relations between computed and observed records also are presented. Spectral analysis of low pass filtered records showed coherence between observed and computed records increased with decreasing frequency. The accuracy of the computed records in low latitudes also is estimated. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The thesis {{examines}} the principal air-sea properties at <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Vessel</b> N (30 N 140 W). In a descriptive section, meteorological and oceanographic data for N are analyzed over 20 years (1951 - 1970) and 7 years (1964 - 1970), respectively. A rainfall estimate is constructed for the 20 year period. The yearly average rainfall is 22 centimeters, {{far less than}} current estimates. Daily and seasonal variations are presented. Heat budgets of the surface show that the two decades are distinctly different. Anomalies of the 20 years of all meteorological variables are calculated. The pressure anomaly appears to be loosely correlated with anomalous large scale events in the equatorial dry zone. Time series cross-sections are shown of the mixed layer depth, bottle temperature and salinity. The near surface density appears to be largely controlled by temperature. Surface wind speed, air pressure, sea temperature, air temperature and dew point spectra for a 10 -year period (1961 - 1970) are shown in a spectral section. Spectra are computed separately for the 4 seasons. Rotary spectra for the wind are also calculated. In a discussion of mixed layer dynamics, theoretical calculations indicate that salinity is not {{a significant factor in}} the Eastern subtropics. In a final section, Denman's mixed layer model is applied to two cases of data from N. It is found that Denman's model describes the local mixed layer changes in the one case where advective effects could be resolved. It is suggested that mixed layer extinction lengths for sunlight are shorter than previously believed [...] about 5 meters. Denman's mixed layer model appears applicable to local changes in the Eastern subtropics...|$|E
