40|$|Organisations owning and {{managing}} infrastructure asset are constantly striving {{to obtain the}} greatest lifetime value from their infrastructure assets. Many such organisations have adopted the concept of &# 039;&# 039;asset management&# 039;&# 039; {{with the aim of}} improving the performance <b>of</b> their infrastructure <b>assets.</b> This paper evaluates the adoption <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management to improve performance in the context of organisations managing infrastructure assets. Relevant previous research studies on main barriers to the adoption <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management are reviewed. Analysis of these ﬁndings, together with deductive reasoning, leads {{to the development of the}} proposed improvement strategies. Three issues were identiﬁed as barrier to the advancement of the concept <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management. They are (1) lack of recognition (2) fragmentation; and (3) growing complexity. To overcome these issues, this paper suggests that the organisations manage infrastructure assets must (1) adopt a more strategic approach in the management <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>assets</b> (2) develop a framework <b>of</b> strategic infrastructure <b>asset</b> management processes, and (3) identify the core capabilities needed in the management <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>assets.</b> This paper presents the direction for further research to advance the concept <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management in the management <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>asset...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a chapter in}} the {{forthcoming}} Handbook of International Economics. It surveys {{the literature on the}} specification <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets and the implications of differences in specification for the macroeconomic adjustment process. Builders of portfolio balance models have generally employed "postulated" asset demand functions, rather than deriving these directly from micro foundations. The first major sec-tion of the paper lays out a postulated general specification <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets and summarizes the fundamental short-run results of portfolio balance models using a very basic specification <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets. Then,rudimentary specifications of a balance of payments equation and goods market equilibrium conditions are supplied, so that the dynamic distribution effects of the trade account under static and rational expectations with both fixed goods prices and flexible goods prices can be analyzed. The second major section of the paper surveys and analyzes microfoundation models <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> demands using stochastic calculus. The microeconomic theory <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> demands implies some but not all of the properties of the basic specification <b>of</b> postulated <b>asset</b> demands at the macrolevel. Since the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis depend crucially on the form <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> demand functions, it is important to continue to explore the implications of micro foundations for macro specification. ...|$|R

Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E

5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement.

In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries.
