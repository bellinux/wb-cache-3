5|$|Both the Perfect Works and Ultimania {{books have}} focused {{primarily}} on Square and Square Enix's role-playing video game franchises, such as the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series; over 45 of the 75 books are for games related to the Final Fantasy series. Sometimes, multiple books have been written per game or revised editions have been published years afterwards. One of the books, Final Fantasy IX Ultimania Online, was solely published online as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> by Square Enix with online content delivery; another for Final Fantasy XI was planned, but the idea was abandoned as unsuccessful and all subsequent books have been published traditionally. The Ultimania series had sold over 10 million books by July 2007. All of the books have been released solely in Japanese, but in October 2017 Dark Horse Books announced {{that they would be}} publishing English translations of the three-volume 2012 Final Fantasy 25th Memorial Ultimania as Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive, for release starting in June 2018.|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} test <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment's</b> external validity is replication — conducting the study over again, generally with different subject populations or in different settings. Researches will often use different methods, {{to see if}} they still get the same results.|$|R

5|$|Sephiroth is {{revealed}} in Final Fantasy VII {{to be the result}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> by the megacorporation Shinra, in which they injected him with cells from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova when he was still a fetus. Upon discovering this, Sephiroth decides to follow what he believes to be his destiny and take control of the Planet, whilst Cloud and the game's other protagonists attempt to stop him. Sephiroth's role in the story, as well as his background, are expanded in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Additionally, he appears as a boss character in the Kingdom Hearts series, and other video games developed by Square. Sephiroth has been well-received within the video game community, and is highly ranked on many lists of the best video game villains and Final Fantasy characters.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> viewed via a mirror were {{expected}} to be identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E

5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus as a result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E
5|$|While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, {{chaos and}} Jr. are {{attacked}} by U-TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence {{for the deaths}} of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by Albedo, who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by Albedo activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. {{and the rest of the}} group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals himself to have been part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> by Dmitri Yuriev: Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U-DO. The three were close, but Albedo became disturbed when he discovered his ability to survive any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U-DO, resulting in everyone except himself, Albedo and Gaignun being killed. Albedo was touched by U-DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, Albedo hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, Albedo opens the way to Miltia.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} its l'Cie {{soldiers}} and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys {{the forces of}} Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystals offers them the chance to become l'Cie. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, {{along with the rest}} of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of Type-0, the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times.|$|E

40|$|Microarrays {{technologies}} are {{a relatively new}} development that allow biologists to monitor the activity of thousands of genes (normally around 8, 000) in parallel across multiple stages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biological process.
