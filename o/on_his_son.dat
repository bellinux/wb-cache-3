Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Edward Gough Whitlam {{was born}} on 11 July 1916 at the family home 'Ngara', 46 Rowland Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne. He was the older of two {{children}} (he had a younger sister, Freda) born to Martha (née Maddocks) and Fred Whitlam. His father was a federal public servant who later served as Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and Whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> Since the boy's maternal grandfather was also named Edward, from early childhood he was called by his middle name, Gough, which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather, who had been named after the British soldier Field-Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough.|$|E
5|$|In 1320, {{following}} the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 <b>on),</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos and his entourage of young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity murder of the young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two.|$|E

5|$|With William dead, Henry's {{alliance}} with Anjou– {{which had been}} based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> marrying Fulk's daughter– began to disintegrate. Fulk returned from the Levant and demanded that Henry return Matilda and her dowry, a range of estates and fortifications in Maine. Matilda left for Anjou, but Henry argued that the dowry had in fact originally belonged to him before it came into the possession of Fulk, and so declined to hand the estates back to Anjou. Fulk married his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, and granted them Maine. Once again, conflict broke out, as Amaury de Montfort allied himself with Fulk and led a revolt along the Norman-Anjou border in 1123. Amaury was joined by several other Norman barons, headed by Waleran de Beaumont, one of the sons of Henry's old ally, Robert of Meulan.|$|E

25|$|Jesper took an {{interest}} in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran Pietist movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with God rather than relying on sheer faith (sola fide). Sola fide is a tenet of the Lutheran Church, and Jesper was charged with being a pietist heretic.

Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that angels and spirits were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.|$|E

25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese.

On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, especially now that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E
