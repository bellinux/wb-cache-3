50|$|An <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> is a {{proxy server}} that is {{accessible}} by any Internet user. Generally, a proxy server only allows users within a network group (i.e. a closed proxy) to {{store and forward}} Internet services such as DNS or web pages to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group. With an <b>open</b> <b>proxy,</b> however, any user on the Internet is able to use this forwarding service.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> {{are often}} implicated in abuse, {{a number of}} methods have been {{developed}} to detect them and to refuse service to them. IRC networks with strict usage policies automatically test client systems for known types of <b>open</b> <b>proxies.</b> Likewise, a mail server may be configured to automatically test mail senders for <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> using software such as proxycheck.|$|R
50|$|Most public VPNs {{work through}} <b>open</b> <b>proxies.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> is a {{forwarding}} {{proxy server}} that is accessible by any Internet user. Gordon Lyon estimates there are [...] "hundreds of thousands" [...] of open proxies on the Internet. An anonymous <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> {{allows users to}} conceal their IP address while browsing the Web or using other Internet services. There are varying degrees of anonymity however, {{as well as a}} number of methods of 'tricking' the client into revealing itself regardless of the proxy being used.|$|E
50|$|Undernet {{also runs}} an <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> scanner. This scans users {{currently}} connecting {{to the network}} for open WinGate, SOCKS version 4/5, and HTTP proxy servers. IP addresses hosting <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> servers are automatically G-lined from the network. These changes {{were put in place}} after the 2001 Denial-of-service attacks almost destroyed the network and left Undernet without the registered channel service bot for months. In 2010, Undernet also started to g-line Tor exit nodes, instead of assigning those users a cloak like e.g. Quakenet.|$|E
50|$|An {{anonymous}} <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> {{is useful}} to those seeking online anonymity and privacy as it can help users hide their IP address from web servers since the server requests appear to originate from the proxy server. It {{makes it harder to}} reveal their identity and thereby helps preserve their perceived security while browsing the web or using other internet services. Real anonymity and extensive internet security might not be achieved by this measure alone as website operators can use client-side scripts to determine the browser’s real IP address and the <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> may be keeping logs of all connections.|$|E

2500|$|The Exploits Block List (XBL) targets [...] "illegal {{3rd party}} exploits, {{including}} <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> worms/viruses with built-in spam engines, virus-infected PCs & servers {{and other types}} of trojan-horse exploits." [...] That is to say it is a list of known <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> and exploited computers being used to send spam and viruses. The XBL includes information gathered by Spamhaus as well as by other contributing DNSBL operations such as the Composite Blocking List (CBL).|$|R
50|$|The ServInt Corporation is a {{provider}} of managed virtual private servers, dedicated web hosting services and <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> based in Reston, Virginia, United States.|$|R
5000|$|Proxy servers outside China can be used, {{although}} using just {{a simple}} <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> (HTTP or SOCKS) without also using an encrypted tunnel (such as HTTPS) does little to circumvent the sophisticated censors.|$|E
50|$|SlashNET is run {{entirely by}} volunteers {{from around the}} globe. SlashNET's servers run UnrealIRCd v3.2.5 on FreeBSD and Linux. IRC {{services}} and Blitzed <b>Open</b> <b>Proxy</b> Monitor are also utilized to provide a quality IRC experience for users.|$|E
50|$|An <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> is {{one which}} will create {{connections}} for any client to any server, without authentication. Like open relays, open proxies were once relatively common, as many administrators {{did not see}} a need to restrict access to them.|$|E
5000|$|Slightly {{harder to}} circumvent, {{although}} users can use <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> or the Tor network, and servers can use another port than 80, or HTTPS.|$|R
5000|$|Freegate, Ultrasurf, and Psiphon {{are free}} {{programs}} that circumvent the China firewall using multiple <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> but still behave {{as though the}} user is in China.|$|R
50|$|Groups of IRC and {{electronic}} mail operators run DNSBLs publishing {{lists of the}} IP addresses of known <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> such as AHBL, CBL, NJABL (till 2013), and SORBS (since 2002).|$|R
50|$|A badly {{configured}} <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> {{can also}} allow {{access to a}} private subnetwork or DMZ: this is a high security concern for any company or home network because computers that usually are out of risk or firewalled can be directly attacked.|$|E
5000|$|Public {{awareness}} for ShowStash steadily {{increased as}} word spread, {{and the site}} when it was shut down it had more than 2 million unique visitors per month. Currently, showstash.com redirects to an <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> service and has no content for streaming or download.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for a computer to run as an <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> server without the computer's owner knowing it. This can result from misconfiguration of proxy software running on the computer, or from infection with malware (viruses, trojans or worms) designed for this purpose. If it is caused by malware, the infected computer {{is known as a}} zombie computer.|$|E
50|$|NJABL {{maintained}} {{a list of}} known and potential spam sources (open mail relays, <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> <b>open</b> form to mail HTTP gateways, dynamic IP pools, and direct spammers) {{for the purpose of}} being able to tag or refuse e-mail and thereby block spam from certain sources. NJABL automatically retests only listed open relays every 90 days.|$|R
50|$|ServInt's primary {{services}} provide clients with managed virtual private servers, dedicated web hosting services, and <b>open</b> <b>proxies.</b> The company partners with several organizations to deliver additional products, including Jelastic, MySQL, Apache, Symantec, and WordPress.|$|R
50|$|To {{accomplish}} the sporgery attack, the spammers used several methods to acquire Internet access. Open NNTP servers were used when available, {{to such an}} extent that a great many had to be closed by their owners. When open NNTP servers eventually became scarce, <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> were used. These proxies allowed Scientology partisans to use someone else's computer hardware to sporge. Due to default security policies in many proxy server products at the time (late 1990s) being lax, many such proxies were available for abuse. Since that time, <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> have become the most popular resource for other spammers to abuse, eclipsing open relays and other insecure hosts.|$|R
5000|$|Proxy {{detection}}: Most modern servers support {{detection of}} users attempting to connect through an insecure (misconfigured or exploited) proxy server, which {{can then be}} denied a connection. An example is the Blitzed <b>Open</b> <b>Proxy</b> Monitor or BOPM. This proxy detection software is used by several networks, although that real time list of proxies is defunct since early 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The {{continuum}} of unlinkability {{can also be}} seen, in part, on Wikipedia. Some registered users make no attempt to disguise their real identities (for example, by placing their real name on their user page). The pseudonym of unregistered users is their IP address, which can, in many cases, easily be linked to them. Other registered users prefer to remain anonymous, and do not disclose identifying information. However, Wikipedia's server logs may enable system administrators to determine the IP address, and perhaps the true name, of a registered user (see [...] {{for a list of}} the conditions under which such a linkage would be attempted). It is possible, in theory, to create an unlinkable Wikipedia pseudonym by using an <b>Open</b> <b>proxy,</b> a Web server that disguises the user's IP address. However, most <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> addresses are blocked indefinitely due to their frequent use by vandals (see [...] ). Additionally, Wikipedia's public record of a user's interest areas, writing style, and argumentative positions may still establish an identifiable pattern.|$|E
50|$|A proxy list {{is a list}} of open HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS {{proxy servers}} all on one website. Proxies allow users to make {{indirect}} network connections to other computer network services. Proxy lists include the IP addresses of computers hosting <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> servers, meaning that these proxy servers are available to anyone on the internet. Proxy lists are often organized by the various proxy protocols the servers use. Many proxy lists index Web proxies, which can be used without changing browser settings.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{just like}} other <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> <b>open</b> {{installations}} of CGI:IRC, {{which do not}} restrict the server used, can also be abused. Usually CGI:IRC is abused to create many clones, which are used to flood an IRC network or a particular user. In response, many networks have started to ban CGI:IRC clients except those which originate from their own CGI:IRC proxy (if they have one).|$|R
5000|$|The DNSbl {{list was}} {{developed}} for use in SMTP services and was a real-time blocking system. This means that {{data were collected from}} various sources 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in real time, and merged into the database. [...] The data included spam sources, <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> <b>open</b> relays, DDoS drones, Usenet spam sources, and the controversial Shoot On Sight listing policy.|$|R
50|$|In November 2007 the Syrian {{government}} blocked Facebook, {{explaining that}} the website promoted attacks on authorities. The Facebook ban, like the ban of most websites, was not entirely effective and many people were able to maintain access using <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> or other circumvention techniques.|$|R
50|$|Spammers {{frequently}} {{seek out}} and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as open mail relays and <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> servers. SMTP forwards mail from one server to another—mail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of authentication {{to ensure that the}} user is a customer of that ISP. Open relays, however, do not properly check who is using the mail server and pass all mail to the destination address, making it harder to track down spammers.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{is simply an}} imitation MTA which gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server which gives the appearance of being an <b>open</b> <b>proxy.</b> Spammers who probe systems for open relays/proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources and potentially revealing information about themselves and {{the origin of the}} spam they are sending to the entity that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis.|$|E
50|$|Proposing so many lists can confuse a MAPS {{subscribe}}r; postmasters may hurriedly {{subscribe to}} all lists. The {{difference between an}} <b>open</b> <b>proxy</b> which relays spam and a 'somehow open', spam relay is not clear, so postmasters may just conclude the more lists they use, the more spam they block. However, one of MAPS lists, the DUL, is {{significantly different from the}} others. The DUL was supposed to list addresses which are dynamically assigned to end-users (but in practice it also includes statically-allocated ones), which are not directly related to spam, and there is no evidence in MAPS archives of any such address having been used to relay spam.|$|E
40|$|The {{desire for}} uncensored {{access to the}} Internet has {{motivated}} the development of both <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> like Tor and social graph-based overlays like FreeNet. However, neither design is sufficient, as relays in <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> are easily exposed and blocked, and overlays based just on social trust suffer from poor availability and performance. In this paper, we introduce the design for a new overlay service, Unblock, constructed from an augmented social graph. In Unblock, multi-hop paths through social links protect individual participants from exposure to adversaries. Unblock achieves good performance by introducing additional links in the network graph {{in a manner that}} minimizes vulnerability. We also develop several transport level techniques for improved latency. We demonstrate the practicality of the system for web traffic workloads. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to open mail relays, DSBL lists hosts that were vulnerable to abuse due to formmail bugs, <b>open</b> <b>proxies,</b> and other problems. Because the testers can use any available method {{to trigger the}} listme messages, they can adapt to newly discovered vulnerabilities as spammers do.|$|R
50|$|The lawsuit {{alleges that}} many of the messages, which deluged Microsoft Hotmail {{accounts}} in particular, were sent via hijacked computers, using <b>open</b> <b>proxies</b> and false headers to conceal the true senders, in violation of the federal CAN-SPAM law. It is also alleged that JDO Media has no contact information, other than past advertising at various now-defunct websites.|$|R
