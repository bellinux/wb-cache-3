5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her first attempt at writing fantasy, rather than science-fiction. A Wizard of Earthsea was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of A Wizard of Earthsea in 2018.|$|E

5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the edges.|$|E
5000|$|For example, the [...] "species of {{permutations}}" [...] maps each finite set A {{to the set}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> permutations <b>of</b> A, {{and each}} bijection from A to another set B naturally induces a bijection from the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> permutations <b>of</b> A to the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> permutations <b>of</b> B. Similarly, the [...] "species of partitions" [...] can be defined by assigning to each finite set the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> its partitions, and the [...] "power set species" [...] assigns to each finite set its power set.|$|R

5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
5|$|After Link restores the Four Sword, Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle—the final dungeon in the game. Link fights Vaati {{just before}} he can drain Zelda <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Light Force hidden within her.

When Link and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle, they meet Vaati as he again changes form for the final battle of the game. After the battle, Ezlo returns to his original form. He finds the cap of wishes he created and gives it to Zelda, granting her a wish. The people cursed by Vaati are cured and the castle is turned back to normal. The hat overflows {{with the power of}} life and disappears. Ezlo gives Link a new hat and tells him that he enjoyed traveling with him, then leaves just as the door to the Minish world closes.|$|E
