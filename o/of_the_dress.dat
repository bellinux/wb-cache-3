30|$|Alginate {{dressings}} {{are mainly}} {{used to treat}} exudating wounds including infected post-operative wounds and leg ulcers. They are available in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> porous sheets formed by freeze drying or fibrous materials intended for packing into wound cavities. When an alginate dressing comes in contact with an exuding wound, an ion exchange reaction takes place. Calcium ions in <b>the</b> alginate <b>dressing</b> are exchanged with sodium ions in the tissue fluid or wound exudates and <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> swells. <b>The</b> degree <b>of</b> swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> depends upon <b>the</b> chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> and also on its botanical origin (Thomas 2000). Alginate dressings generally have high mannuronic or guluronic group contents.|$|R
5|$|The photo {{originated}} from a washed-out colour {{photograph of a}} dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr. In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone, more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold and #blackandblue. Although the actual colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> was eventually confirmed to be black and blue, the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour. At the same time, members {{of the scientific community}} began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision.|$|E

5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We analyze <b>the</b> {{fluctuations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> sliver solution {{found in}} a previous paper, hep-th/ 0311198, in <b>the</b> operator formulation <b>of</b> Vacuum String Field Theory. We derive the tachyon wave function and then analyze the higher level fluctuations. We show that <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> is responsible for implementing the transversality condition on the massless vector. In order to consistently deal with the singular k = 0 mode we introduce a string midpoint regulator and we show {{that it is possible}} to accommodate all the open string states among the solutions to <b>the</b> linearized equations <b>of</b> motion.
