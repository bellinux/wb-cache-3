Windows 8's stock apps were also updated, a new Bing-based unified search system was added, SkyDrive was given deeper integration with the operating system, and a number of new stock apps, along with a tutorial, were added. Windows 8.1 also added support for 3D printing, Miracast media streaming, NFC printing, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
25|$|Windows Presentation Foundation (codenamed Avalon) is the {{overhaul}} of the graphical subsystem in Windows and the flagship resolution independent API for 2D and 3D graphics, raster and vector graphics (XAML), fixed and adaptive documents (XPS), advanced typography, animation (XAML), data binding, audio and video in Windows Vista. WPF enables richer control, design, {{and development of the}} visual aspects of Windows programs. Based on DirectX, it renders all graphics using Direct3D. Routing the graphics through Direct3D allows Windows to offload graphics tasks to the GPU, reducing the workload on the computer's CPU. This capability is used by the Desktop Window Manager to make the desktop, all windows and all other shell elements into 3D surfaces. WPF applications can be deployed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> or hosted in a web browser (XBAP).|$|E
25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|E

500|$|The Trash (or [...] "Wastebasket" [...] in the British version) empties {{when the}} Finder terminates. If MultiFinder is not running, this occurs {{as soon as}} an {{application}} launches. Icons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> in System 6 are not organized into a single folder, as in later operating systems. Instead, the system records whether each file is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> or not. This is inefficient and confusing, as the user cannot browse to the desktop in applications besides the Finder, even within the standard Open and Save As dialog boxes. Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts to files, was another limitation of file management on System 6. Custom file and folder icons are also not supported. These problems were all remedied in System 7.|$|E
500|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie game, {{focusing on a}} series of seven fictional police interviews from 1994. As the game begins, players are presented with an old desktop, which contains several files and programs. Among the programs are instructional text files, which explain the game's mechanics. One of the programs automatically open <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> is the [...] "L.O.G.I.C. Database", which allows players to search and sort video clips within the database, of which there are 271. The video clips are police interviews with Hannah Smith, a British woman. The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety, forcing players to view short clips. In the interviews, Hannah answers unknown questions to an off-screen detective, prompting players to decipher the context of the answers. Hannah's answers are transcribed, and players find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions, attempting to solve the case by piecing together information. As players select clips, they can enter user tags, which are then available as searchable terms. One of the files <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> is a database checker, which allows players to review the amount of clips that have been viewed; as a clip is viewed, the red box in the database checker changes to green. The desktop also features the minigame Mirror Game, based on the strategy board game Reversi.|$|E
500|$|Prevailing in {{an early}} {{copyright}} infringement suit in the mid-1980s, Apple forced Digital Research to alter basic components in Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager ("GEM"), almost a direct copy of the Macintosh's graphical user interface (GUI), or [...] "look and feel". Features Digital Research removed from GEM {{as a result of}} the lawsuit included disk drive icons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>desktop,</b> movable and resizable windows in the file manager, shading in the title bars, and window open/close animations. In addition, visual elements including the scrollbar thumbs and the window close button were changed to be less similar to those in the Mac GUI.|$|E
