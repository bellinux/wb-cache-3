5|$|Many of Konkani littérateur V. J. P. Saldanha's Konkani {{historical}} novels such as Belthangaddicho Balthazar (Balthazar of Belthangadi), Devache Krupen (By the Grace of God), Sardarachi Sinol (The {{sign of the}} Knights) and Infernachi Daram (The {{gates of}} Hell) deal with the captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam. In these novels, the Mangalorean Catholic community {{of the eighteenth century}} are portrayed as brave, hardworking and selfless, while Tipu is portrayed as cunning, haughty, hard-hearted, revengeful, yet full <b>of</b> <b>self-control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Townsend, the founder, songwriter, and {{frontman}} {{of extreme}} metal band Strapping Young Lad and progressive metal group The Devin Townsend Band, dissolved both bands in 2006 {{to spend time}} with his family and avoid the burnout of touring and interviewing. After a period of self-discovery and a year-long break from songwriting, Townsend began work on a four-album series to clarify his identity as a musician. Ki includes themes <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and sobriety, and is musically subtler than much of the artist's previous work, consisting of ambient rock music interlaced with tentative bursts of heavy metal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Gottfredson and Hirschi’s {{general theory}} has {{generated}} {{an abundance of}} research examining the effects <b>of</b> low <b>self-control</b> on crime and analogous behaviors. Less research, however, {{has focused on the}} factors that contribute to the development <b>of</b> low <b>self-control.</b> Gottfredson and Hirschi maintain that ineffective parents are the sole cause for the emergence <b>of</b> low <b>self-control.</b> At the same time, they disregard the possibility that low self-control has a biological or genetic component. This article extends prior research and examines the effects of birth complications and parental involvement on low self-control. Using a sample of twin children, the authors find that parental involvement is only weakly and inconsistently related to low self-control. On the other hand, although most of the birth complications had no apprecia-ble effect on low self-control, anoxia (oxygen starvation) emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor <b>of</b> low <b>self-control...</b>|$|R

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that religiosity {{can be a}} pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack <b>of</b> <b>self-control.</b> Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity {{has been found to}} mitigate the negative impact of injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the Five-Factor and HEXACO personality correlates <b>of</b> two common <b>self-control</b> constructs - Tangney self-control and Grasmick self-control - and {{their relations with}} delinquency. In both a student and a community sample, conscientiousness (mainly the prudence facet) was the most consistent and strongest correlate of both constructs. HEXACO honesty-humility was an important correlate <b>of</b> Grasmick <b>self-control</b> but not <b>of</b> Tangney <b>self-control.</b> Additionally, honesty-humility (mainly the fairness facet) was the most consistent predictor of delinquency, whereas the two self-control scales differed in {{the extent to which}} they predicted delinquency across samples. © 2013...|$|R

25|$|In his {{historical}} novels on the Seringapatam captivity of Konkani Catholics by the Konkani littérateur V.J.P.

25|$|According to Aquinas, to lack any {{of these}} virtues is to lack {{the ability to make}} a moral choice. For example, {{consider}} a man who possesses the virtues of justice, prudence, and fortitude, yet lacks temperance. Due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and desire for pleasure, despite his good intentions, he will find himself swaying from the moral path.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the provocative}} acts or {{words and the}} defendant's {{response}} met the 'ordinary person' standard prescribed by the statute is the question the jury must consider, not the altogether looser question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the jury consider the loss <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> was sufficient excusable. The statute does not leave each jury free to set whatever standard they consider appropriate in the circumstances by which to judge whether the defendant's conduct is 'excusable'.|$|E

25|$|Although Thompson {{acknowledges}} {{similarities between}} African and European cool in shared notions <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and imperturbability, {{he finds the}} cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the African diaspora {{to be different from}} that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of spirit possession {{has been documented}} in modern Rajasthan. Some of the spirits that are claimed to possess Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits include murdered royalty, the underworld god Bhaironji, and Muslim saints. Bad spirits include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The possessed individual {{is referred to as}} a ghorala ("mount"). Possession, even if it is by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as it entails loss <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and violent emotional outbursts.|$|E
25|$|In mother–infant synchrony, {{the mother}} and infant's ability to change their own {{behaviour}} based on the other's response is taken into consideration. Infant affect (vocal and facial) and maternal stimulation (vocal and tactile) are good indicators of mother–infant synchrony. Zentall et al. found that infants' rhythm was stronger and interactions were led better at 5 months than at 3 months. According to the study, an infant's ability to send signals and a mother's ability to perceive them increase with synchrony over time. Studies have shown that mother–infant synchrony {{will result in the}} infant's development <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> and other self-regulating behaviours later on in life.|$|E

25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack <b>of</b> <b>self-control,</b> often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} ego {{depletion}} {{do not appear}} to be a product of mood or arousal. In most studies, mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self-control and those who did not. Likewise, mood and arousal was not related to final self-control performance. The same is true for more specific mood items, such as frustration, irritation, annoyance, boredom, or interest as well. Feedback about success and failure of the self-control efforts does not appear to affect performance. In short, the decline in self-control performance after exerting self-control appears to be directly related to the amount <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> exerted and cannot be easily explained by other, well-established psychological processes.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{exercise}} can make muscles stronger, {{there are signs}} that regular exertions <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> can improve willpower strength. These improvements typically take the form of resistance to depletion, in the sense that performance at self-control tasks deteriorates at a slower rate. Targeted efforts to control behavior in one area, such as spending money or exercise, lead to improvements in unrelated areas, such as studying or household chores. And daily exercises in self-control, such as improving posture, altering verbal behavior, and using one's nondominant hand for simple tasks, gradually produce improvements in self-control as measured by laboratory tasks. The finding that these improvements carry over into tasks vastly different from the daily exercises shows that the improvements are not due to simply increasing skill or acquiring self-efficacy from practice.|$|E

25|$|According to the ego (or cognitive) {{depletion}} theory <b>of</b> impulsivity, <b>self-control</b> {{refers to}} the capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideals, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the pursuit <b>of</b> long-term goals. <b>Self-control</b> enables a person to restrain or override one response, thereby making a different response possible.|$|R

25|$|In 1975, when Genie turned 18, {{her mother}} stated that {{she wished to}} care for her, and in mid-1975 the Riglers decided to end their foster {{parenting}} and agreed to let Genie move back in with her mother at her childhood home. John Miner remained Genie's legal guardian and the Riglers offered to continue assisting with Genie's care, and despite the NIMH grant ending Curtiss continued to conduct regular testing and observations. While living together Genie's mother found many of Genie's behaviors, especially her lack <b>of</b> <b>self-control,</b> very distressing, {{and after a few}} months the task of caring for Genie by herself quickly overwhelmed her. She then contacted the California Department of Health to find care for Genie, which David Rigler said she did without his or Marilyn's knowledge, and {{in the latter part of}} 1975 authorities transferred Genie to the first of what would become a succession of foster homes.|$|E
500|$|In Tantra, the Mahavidya goddess Chhinnamasta is {{depicted}} severing her own head and {{standing on the}} copulating couple of Kama and Rati, with the latter on top, (viparita-rati sex position). The woman-on-top position suggests female dominance over male. Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kama and Rati is interpreted {{by some as a}} symbol <b>of</b> <b>self-control</b> [...] of sexual desire, while others interpret it as the goddess, being an embodiment of sexual energy. Images of Chhinnamasta depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati [...] in a non-suppressive fashion are associated with the latter interpretation.

[...] This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; [...] "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy," [...] and to accept even slaves as [...] "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{estimates}} a balanced-growth consistent, dynamic, {{structural model}} of intertemporal consumption and asset pricing that allows for, {{but does not}} assume, the Gul-Pesendorfer preferences <b>of</b> temptation and <b>self-control,</b> using synthetic panel data constructed from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. One novelty of our model is that the cross-sectional distribution of wealth-consumption ratio is a potentially important determinant for the implied pricing kernel, additional to the cross-sectional distribution of consumption growth, while {{the importance of this}} additional factor depends on the strength <b>of</b> temptation and <b>self-control.</b> The estimates that we obtain provide evidence supporting the existence <b>of</b> temptation and <b>self-control</b> in preferences. With reasonable precision, we estimate a significant present-biased temptation strength, and we reject the null hypothesis of no temptation at common confidence levels. We explore the quantitative implications <b>of</b> the <b>self-control</b> problems for equity premium, risk-free rate, and asset price volatility. ...|$|R
