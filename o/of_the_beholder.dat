40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to understand}} the relationship between <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> art and <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> <b>The</b> very existence <b>of</b> this relationship is the reason why there is a possibility of creating simulacra. Theatricality is a characteristic of an artistic object, which isn’t necessarily spectacular. Simulacra exist because of this theatrical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> art, which depends on a space and time experience. There are several degrees of spectator interaction in this experience: absorption and game; empathetic imagination and commotion; desire and transgression. The space/time between the individual and <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> art is diluted, generating substitution processes that incite the spectator’s identification with the object.

25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) {{are just as important}} as the whole. Yet, the total image, greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholder.</b> People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to be cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the paradoxical {{and at the}} same time interesting relationship between Christian religion and <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> slavery in <b>the</b> American historical context. Through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Kenneth Burke’s concept and theory of Perception by Incongruity as a theoretical and conceptual framework, this {{study examines}} Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin and Frederick Douglass’ <b>The</b> Narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Life <b>of</b> Frederick Douglass: An American Slave. In <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> this study, Perception by Incongruity, as a theoretical and conceptual tool has the literary and the rhetorical resources to unmask the ironies and paradoxes involved in slave holding religion and religion holding slaves. The principal research question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present study seeks to probe <b>the</b> usability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian faith by slave owners to dominate and pacify the slaves, and the instrumentalisation by <b>the</b> slaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian faith as a liberatory and emancipatory belief. Perception by Incongruity enriches the present study in so far as it unmasks the incongruity and paradox of masters and slaves sharing <b>the</b> same definition <b>of</b> God and faith and still remaining in their conflictual positions of masters and slaves. Since this study is a study in literature, <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> literature study and textual analysis are deployed in examining the primary texts, Uncle Tom’s Cabin and <b>The</b> Narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> Frederick Douglass: An American Slave. A multiplicity of secondary texts; in form of critical and empirical literature; are used throughout this study to support observations, arguments and conclusions that are advanced by the study. Summatively, this study observes and concludes that religion, in this case Christianity occupies a perceptively incongruous position where it is suable by people in conflicting situations. Further, where domination, power and capitalism as an economic system meet, religion belongs in the mind and <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beholders</b> who seeks to use it to justify and defend their particular interests and positions.

While working on Disney's The Lion King in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film. Film composer Hans Zimmer later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores.
