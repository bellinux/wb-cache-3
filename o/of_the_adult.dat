5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult.</b> Its cervical ribs - which are long, like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> - face {{the same direction as}} the dorsal vertebrae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reshuffling}} {{process of}} the Politburo ended in the mid-to-late 1970, the Soviet leadership evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older than most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> population.|$|E
5|$|Another {{literary}} {{reference to}} mayflies {{is seen in}} The Epic of Gilgamesh, {{one of the earliest}} surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh's life is compared to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> mayfly.|$|E

5|$|Below {{is a list}} of former-participants of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest {{who have}} gone on to {{participate}} at the senior version of the contest. Since , the winner of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest has been invited as a guest to the final <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> contest.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{predation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> cicada is common, with wrens and grey fantails, noisy miners, blue-faced honeyeaters, little wattlebirds, {{grey and}} pied butcherbirds, magpie-larks, Torresian crows, white-faced herons {{and even the}} nocturnal tawny frogmouth, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.|$|E
5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> {{is developed}} through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> is visible before the outer surface hardens â€“ the head, {{resting on the}} thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 90-130 mm. <b>The</b> ground-colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> {{is bright}} yellow.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{emergence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> {{occurs in}} early summer. When disturbed, adults are non-aggressive.|$|R
5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This {{is especially true}} for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> speech.|$|E
5|$|Each morph {{accounts}} for 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> males, {{and they make}} {{the same number of}} attempts to court females, but using a different courting display. Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{may be less}} ambiguous {{when the}} fetal remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.|$|E

5|$|If {{the fetal}} remains {{are found in}} a fetal {{position}} and are wholly within the pelvic cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> the fetus died and was interred prior to delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.|$|E
5|$|If the {{majority}} of the fetal remains are in the pelvic cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> yet the legs are extended and/or the cranium lies among the ribs, then the infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of the mother's torso prior to burial. As both bodies skeletonized, the infant's bones would have settled among the mother's ribs and vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Humbertia ambavila and Hypericum lanceolatum. <b>The</b> {{wingspan}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> is approx. 30-35mm.|$|R
50|$|A {{particle}} accelerator is <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> disappearing in <b>the</b> CBBC science fiction drama, The Sparticle Mystery.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{colouration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> is cryptic, {{consisting of}} grey with brown grey and blackish {{remnants of a}} pattern.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles {{are similar}} to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like {{moulting}} adults. Juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.|$|E

5|$|The skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> {{cane toad}} is toxic, {{as well as}} the {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E
50|$|The {{species name}} {{is derived from}} Latin Pica (meaning magpie) and refers to <b>the</b> pied {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> {{range from}} among <b>the</b> largest <b>of</b> all moths (>5 inches {{wingspan}} {{in the black}} witch) to <b>the</b> smallest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macromoths (0.25 in wingspan in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Micronoctuini). <b>The</b> coloration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> spans <b>the</b> full range <b>of</b> dull, drab, and camouflaged (e.g., Zale lunifera and litter moths) to vivid, contrasting, and colorful (e.g., Aganainae and tiger moths). The moths are found on all continents except Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|The {{species name}} {{is derived from}} the Greek word argos (meaning white) {{referring}} to <b>the</b> pale colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) kills Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} sporadically, {{and is the}} only natural predator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> cockatoo. Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally parasitised by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei. In captivity, it is also susceptible to nematodes of the genus Ascaris if it is in a cage with open dirt flooring.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{subspecies}} {{of the common}} starling, which vary clinally in size and the colour tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> plumage. The gradual variation over geographic range and extensive intergradation means that acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 Welsh health survey, {{conducted}} by the Welsh Assembly, reported that 51% of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21% described their health as fair or poor. The survey also recorded that 27% of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Enquiries into health-related lifestyle choices report 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> population are smokers, 45% admit drinking alcohol above recommended guidelines {{at least once a}} week, while 29% undertake the recommended weekly physical activity.|$|E
