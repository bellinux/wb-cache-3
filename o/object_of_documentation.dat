40|$|This {{case study}} {{documents}} a seminar redesign from a teacher-centered instruction format to the collaborative ‘reciprocal peer tutoring’ (RPT) at Aarhus University, Denmark. Departing from Bourdieuian concepts {{and the notion}} of “superdiversity” by Vertovec, we argue that teachers have to meet student requirements within Danish Higher Education (HE). This student body is quite diverse, international and multilinguistic with different cultural expectations and knowledge standards. At the same time, the Danish HE tradition with its low degree of formality and an affinity towards collaborative learning, allows for non-traditional instruction styles as an answer to such heterogeneity. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> our <b>documentation</b> is thus a seminar before and after didactical restructuring in a Danish setting. We document both the in-classroom methods of instruction before and after the implementation of RPT and the methods and instruments used to monitor this change. For this, we provide insight into student group reports, students’ learning reports, a lesson time table, seminar evaluations, focus group interviews, teacher-student communication and course descriptions. Our study contributes on several levels: firstly, we provide course responsibles with a detailed insight into how a seminar redesign to RPT can be achieved. Secondly, we provide a basis for introducing such change by documenting the positive assessment as an outcome of the monitoring. We thereby address diversity and in-classroom heterogeneity on a didactical level...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how teachers {{make use of}} a learning theory, the variation theory, {{as well as their}} own professional expertise and collaboration in a learning study (cf. Pang & Marton, 2003) to help students improve their mathematical understanding. A learning study involves a group of teachers who undertake theoretically grounded collaborative action research on their own practice. Unlike design experiments, a learning study emphasises teachers’ involvement in and ownership of the innovative practices that echo the spirit of the lesson study. The major focus of a learning study is on the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> learning, i. e., on what students are expected to learn, rather than on the teaching arrangements. The results of the learning study reported here show that students belonging to the learning study group outperformed their counterparts in the comparison group. It seems that the variation theory is a powerful tool for improving student understanding. Furthermore, by engaging in systematic and collective evaluation of their classroom practices, professional dialogue among colleagues on how to best deal with the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> learning, and <b>documentation</b> and dissemination <b>of</b> what they have learned from the study, teachers’ sensitivity towards student learning and their own teaching, towards students’ different ways <b>of</b> understanding an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> learning and their own different ways of handling it, and towards the potential of a learning theory are all simultaneously enhanced. This empowers them to see their own professional practice from both a learning- and learner-centred perspective...|$|R

40|$|Seeking to {{challenge}} the focus on 'big data' by understanding it outside of the computational power required to process it, this volume explores the role of digital methods {{in the future of}} digital humanities research. The essays are united by the theme of complexity [...] -but manifest that complexity across an unusual spectrum. The methods included rise out of fields of study including library and information science, informatics, literary studies, English, and computer science. Sources explored include traditional national archives, international web archives, medieval musical scores, digitised books, early modern network ontologies and educational data/learning analytics. These essays discuss the practical implications of web scraping, the implications of creating new scholarly <b>objects,</b> the importance <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> and the intricacies of applying topic modelling and linked open data methods. Together, the volume suggests that the humanities comfort with multiplicities, contingency, and uncertainty in sources may lend itself to resisting the reductionism that makes technical projects easier to manage, flattening messy, human data into neat binaries. These essays remind us that their results must be contextualised through scholars' knowledge of the sources and the methods by which they came to be constructed not just as as 'big data' datasets...|$|R

40|$|Software {{documentation}} is {{an important}} aspect of both software projects and software engineering in general. In fact, documentation engineering has become a popular sub-domain in the software engineering community. Unfortunately, the current perception <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> is that it is outdated, irrelevant and incomplete. For the most part, this perception is probably true. Regrettably, the documentation concern cannot be resolved by simply mandating more and better documentation. This approach fails to resolve the problem as the solution ignores the fundamental goals of software engineering. The role <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> in a software engineering environment is to communicate information to its audience and instill knowledge of the system it describes. Documentation should efficiently allow for future software development without hindering current progress. An engineered solution to the documentation problem would involve allocating appropriate resources to document adequate knowledge about the system to the extent that both current and future development will optimally benefit. Unfortunately, neither do we fully understand the impact <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> on current or future development, nor what aspects <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> contribute to its ability to communicate effectively. We do not really know to what extent we should document in order to balance the trade offs between, on the one hand, allocating too many resources for documentation thus hindering present development; and, on the other hand, not allocating enough resources and thus hindering future development. To complicate matters, increasing documentation resources does not necessarily improve future software development (the ultimate goal <b>of</b> <b>documentation)</b> because we do not really understand what defines documentation quality. Our research focuses on the issue <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> quality. In particular, which attributes <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> make it effective to the audience and how can this information be monitored and parameterized to provide a better perspective about the relevance <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> in a software project...|$|R
