Sepp Blatter said in justification of the 6 + 5 rule: "Over the years and decades, by signing more and more foreign players, clubs have gradually lost their identity, first locally and regionally. " This paper will examine the “ 6 + 5 ” rule in order to determine whether it falls within the scope of EU law or whether it could attract exemption on the basis of the “purely sporting” rule introduced by the ECJ in case 36 / 74 Walrave & Koch. It will be argued that, because of the potential implications of the “ 6 + 5 ” rule, it transcends a rule of “purely sporting” interest and therefore falls within the scope of EU law. The paper will then examine the compatibility of the “ 6 + 5 ” rule with relevant provisions of the TFEU.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine the sphere of legitimate State measures. Member States intervene in many ways in the operation of the internal market and in the activities of private undertakings. When public authorities exercising public powers take measures, which can affect the competition between private entities, the pursuit may lead to the distortion of competition within the internal market. Similarly, fundamental freedoms can be restricted, if access to the market is prohibited or rendered less attractive. The main legal instrument of this study is Article 106 (1) TFEU, which prohibits Member States from circumventing Treaty rules by granting tasks of public authority to public or private undertakings. The provision will be assessed as regards to competition law (Article 102 TFEU) and fundamental freedoms (Article 49 TFEU regarding freedom of establishment and Article 56 TFEU regarding freedom to provide services). In addition, Article 106 (2) TFEU, which provides a derogation from Treaty rules for the Member States in certain situations, will be addressed. State measures which violate the above-mentioned Articles can in some cases be justified in order to pursue the Union’s objective of social market economy. They can be regarded legitimate when they are correcting market failures on areas where certain important activities or services would not be provided merely by the market mechanism. In addition, justifications based on <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> of general/public interest, may materialize when restricting fundamental freedoms. In summary, the first research question is whether State measures create obstacles to the internal market. Additionally, it will be examined, when State measures can be justified.

In the end, the fulfilment of fundamental freedoms will be assessed in cases related to State measures, by applying the market access test...|$|E
40|$|Healthcare was {{for long}} not {{considered}} a matter {{to be dealt with}} by the European Union. It was looked at as outside of the competence of the EU and the legal entitlements of the individual patient to access healthcare services, both inside and outside of its country of residence, was considered purely a matter of national law. The right to seek healthcare cross borders and get the costs reimbursed by the home State was first based in the social security Regulation 1408 / 71. The famous rulings of Kohll and Decker from 1998, however, formed the starting point of some disputed interpretations by the European Court of Justice, which increased the right to reimbursement for cross-border healthcare further than the Regulation. The Court considered healthcare to be an economic activity and, therefore, to be “services” within the meaning of Article 57 of the Treaty. The Court has given several rulings on cross-border healthcare, which have lead to a great uncertainty about the individual entitlements to reimbursement for such healthcare. This dissertation focuses on Directive 2011 / 24 on patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, adopted by the European Union in March 2011, and especially the right to reimbursement for cross-border healthcare. In this dissertation the rules of the Directive are compared to the rulings of the Court of Justice, and it is discussed how the rules of the Directive affect patients’ rights to receive reimbursement for cross-border healthcare. The main principle set out in the Directive is that patients are free to seek the healthcare they need in another EU Member State, and get the costs reimbursed by the home State. This rule may be limited by the Member States by <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> of general interest, and furthermore, by introducing a system of prior authorization. The Directive is found to give gives good clarification and practical effect to the rights that the Court has already recognized in its rulings. The Directive does not, however, broaden the right to seek treatment abroad. Due to the increased clarity, and the fact that many people were not aware of their rights to reimbursement for cross-border healthcare, more EU nationals are likely to use their right to seek healthcare cross borders in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong Special Administration Region of China, HKSAR, {{consists}} of HK Island (represented by Victoria Peak), Kowloon and New Territories, (i. e. N. T., represented by Lion Rock), Lantau Island (represented by Lantau Peak, or Phoenix Peak- {{translation of the}} Chinese name), Victoria Harbour, (bounded by Lei Yue Mun Pass to the East, and The West Boundary joining Tsing Yi Island, HK Island, and Ting Kau of N. T.) and some other islands and sea regions. Four straight lines joining the highest natural points of Victoria Peak, Lion Rock, Lautau Peak [i. e. Phoenix Peak], and one point at the Existing Eastern Boundary Line and another point at the Proposed Western Boundary Line of Victoria Harbour, will form a world-iconic Six-Point Four-Line Geometric figure. The sixth point is the intersecting point {{of two of the}} four geometric lines, and this sixth point coincides with the central position of the existing International Commerce Centre at West Kowloon, which is the tallest building in HKSAR. Applying Menelaus' Theorem directly, an established Euclidian Plane geometric theorem, will result in obtaining “ 1 ” on multiplication of ratios of the map distances between the Peaks, the two points at East and West boundaries of Victoria Harbour, and International Commerce Centre at West Kowloon, provided the existing western boundary is shifted from its existing location at central-south of Tsing Island to the South-western end of Tsing Yi Island, joining to Green island, as proposed in this paper, resulting in a slight expansion of Victoria Harbour. Using all the same six points as above and adding two more lines which intersect, a Seven-Point Six-line geometric figure is formed. Applying Ceva’s Theorem to this geometric figure, which is also an established Euclidian Plane geometric theorem, will also result in obtaining “ 1 ” on multiplication of ratios of the map distances. Thus the two theorems will produce Two “ 1 ”s, hence Double-One, world legacy for HKSAR in physical geo-geometric sense. This “Double-One” discovery will be accomplished, if the Western Boundary of Victoria Harbour is shifted to touch onto the South-Western end of Tsing Yi Island, by expanding the coverage of Victoria Harbour westward, and hence protecting a larger harbour. While mountains and peaks exist in nature without human intervention to define their height, the harbour boundary lines are artificially determined. Attaining world-iconic Geo-Geometric records, and simultaneously protecting a slightly expanded harbour, contributing to world mathematical education and geographical studies, and boosting local and international tourism on actual site visits to HKSAR or via internet, are <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> for Redefining the Western Boundary of Victoria Harbour. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Commissioner, the Fifth Circuit {{reversed}} the Tax Court and {{held that the}} taxpayer was entitled to an ordinary loss deduction from its abandonment of securities. While the conclusion reached by the Fifth Circuit has been overshadowed by the promulgation of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) that effectively treats an abandoned security as worthless and thus characterizes the loss as capital, the case remains noteworthy because it provides an opportunity to examine the statutory interpretation of two distinct Internal Revenue Code sections, section 165 (g) (1) and section 1234 A. The article focuses on what methods of statutory construction should have been utilized to determine the application of these sections to the Pilgrim’s Pride fact-pattern. Ordinary loss treatment for an abandoned security seems conceptually incorrect when both a worthless security and a sale of the security for a de minimis amount would generally result in a capital loss. The article analyzes whether, and if so, under what theory did the courts deciding Pilgrim’s Pride possess the statutory authority to treat the abandonment as a capital loss. Furthermore, assuming the courts had such authority, the article considers whether it was proper to do so under the particular factual circumstances surrounding this case. There {{are a variety of}} statutory construction methodologies each with erudite proponents making very persuasive contentions. Applying an Internal Revenue Code section to a particular fact-pattern, however, it can often be wiser not to be wedded to one approach, e. g., textualism. Instead, it is submitted that employing disparate methodologies depending on the particular circumstances may be sounder. Pilgrim’s Pride provides a focal point for examining statutory interpretation methodologies and illustrating the foregoing. As such, reflecting on the case has continuing relevance despite the widespread application of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) to the abandonment of securities. As demonstrated by the different approaches that I believe were proper here for considering the applicability of sections 165 (g) (1) and 1234 A to Pilgrim’s Pride, distinct circumstances require discrete approaches to applying a statutory provision to a case. Our democratic institutions are not put at risk, by foregoing dogmatic textualism where this would lead to a result wherein “no conceivable tax policy... supports this interpretation” or deeming, in the case of section 165 (g) (1), an abandoned security to be per se worthless. Restraint, however, from deviating from the clear language of the text, such as applying section 1234 A to inherent rights, may be in order where there are no <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> not to do so...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} issue underlying {{this essay is}} {{the tension between the}} EU’s aims of market integration on the one hand, and, on the other, the intervention of Member States in the economy and welfare provision and the exercise of public functions by national authorities in sensitive industrial sectors. In this respect I have focused on one specific aspect: the CJEU’s case law on the special powers held by the State in formerly public companies where the rights conferred on shareholders by ordinary law are reduced for the benefit of public entities. Besides European golden shares, my contribution had dealt with the access to the EU’s market of non-EU public/private hybrids, namely sovereign investors such as sovereign wealth funds (“SWFs”) and state owned enterprises (“SOEs”). The first aim of my research is to investigate in what sense, to what extent and for what reasons the golden shares jurisprudence represents a privileged – although atypical – sedes materiae to illustrate the content and extent of EU economic/market integration, the connection between the latter and the two interrelated concepts of social integration and EU solidarity, and the impact of such dual integration (both economic and social) on Member States’ solidarity. In this regard, three main questions arise: has the CJEU been too activist in condemning Member States with regard to privat(is) e(d) undertakings, or is its approach justified {{in the light of the}} EU’s free market objectives? Is the up-to-date case law likely to endanger the solidarity on which the provision of SGEIs is grounded? Is the scope of manoeuvre currently accorded to Member States too narrow to justify national socio-economic policies on golden shares under the free movement rules (especially, as will be seen further on, from the point of view of the exceptions to these rules) ?. My second general aim is to identify the main concerns raised by the access of SWFs and SOEs to the EU market and, then, to assess whether action by the EU is welcome and necessary in this area. In this respect, the main questions are: is it conceivable a European golden share to restrict this kind of investments to be shaped on the basis of a European notion of solidarity? Should the CJEU be proactive and, for instance, admit ‘new’ Cassis-Gebhard <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> of general interest that could not be admitted vis-à-vis intra-EU investments? Could the derogation provided for in Art. 65. 1 b) allow for a restriction that is compatible with EU law?

40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, <b>overriding</b> <b>reasons</b> of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|E
