40|$|In {{this study}} we make an {{analysis}} of the major aspects concerning the budgets of the EU countries. On this paper we focus on the main taxes of the 27 EU countries. Our analysis concerns the direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes have the following structure: current taxes on income and taxes on capital. Current taxes on income are made up of: taxes on income and <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>taxes.</b> Taxes on income consist of tax on personal income and the tax on the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: taxes on production and imports, which in turn are composed of taxes on production and other taxes on production. The taxes on production consist of: Value Added Tax, taxes on imports excluding VAT and taxes on production excluding VAT and duties. Analysis of main trends of taxation in the European Union countries will be achieved by calculating several indicators, namely: fixed-base indices, chain-based indices, minimum, maximum, average, percentages and percentages of total GDP. </p...|$|E
40|$|The European {{framework}} for fiscal policies is constructed {{mainly on the}} objective of monitoring budget balances and public debt, allowing national governments {{to decide on the}} specific fiscal policy that is more suitable to their internal context and public needs. However, for Euro Area member states this autonomy is restricted by the conditions imposed through the Stability and Growth Pact. As the recent macroeconomic dynamics underlined the necesity of improving the fiscal outcomes, the fiscal framework was updated and modified by the provisions of the new European economic governance meant to avoid unsound and unsustainable fiscal policies that could affect the stability of other Euro Area member states. The Six-Pack, the Fiscal Compact and the other conditions imposed by the reform of the fiscal governance framework are meant to ensure more discipline in drafting and executing national budgets. Even so, national authorities maintain their fiscal sovereignty and the decision regarding fiscal structures remains at their disposal, as long as the drafts are approved and the outcomes are maintained in the limits imposed through the supranational fiscal framework. Regardless of the numerous differences between member states, similar trends regarding tax mixes can be noticed in time. The objectives {{of this paper is to}} analyze fiscal structures of Euro Area member states and to determine, if any, groups with similar fiscal structures, their composition and the similarities that characterize Euro Area in this respect. In order to have a clear overview of fiscal structures within Euro Area, we analyzed data for 17 member states, for year 2012, taking into consideration total general government revenue, indirect taxation, direct taxation and social contributions. As one of the aims of this paper is to determine whether in Euro Area the main contributors are corporations or individuals, we also analyzed the structure of direct taxation, dividing it into taxes on income of corporations and taxes on income of individuals and households and <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>taxes.</b> Actual social contributions were also split into employer’s actual contributions, employee’s social contributions and social contributions of self- and non-employed persons. As the primary data analysis revealed many differences between Euro Area member states, but also similarities concerning various fiscal aggregates, we completed the analysis through multidimensional analysis, with the aims of classifying Euro Area member states into subgroups with similar fiscal structures. Taking into consideration the above mentioned variables, we used cluster analysis in order to determine which member states have similar fiscal structures and which are the main similarities that characterize Euro Area in this respect...|$|E

It departs from the usual set up of tax competition by relaxing the assumption of balanced budget. Expected taxation <b>other</b> than <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> levels motivates migration. Starting from an initial spatial configuration, be it core-periphery or symmetric equilibrium, the analysis identifies the critical thresholds of divergences or convergence of debt-ratios which break the initial configuration. The paper also shows that a high-debt country is a weaker player in tax competition and that tax harmonisation may not necessarily reduce migration flows...|$|R

Proponents of these changes argue, among <b>other</b> things, that <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> rules are unfair and contribute to unnecessary spending for health care. This Issue Brief examines changes that policymakers are discussing, explores the history of tax laws concerning the tax treatment of health benefits and the cost to the federal government in forgone taxes because of these laws, and examines some the advantages and disadvantages that could result from the proposed changes. Estimated cost in tax revenue—Health benefits account for one of the largest tax expenditures in the U. S. budget. Estimates for personal federal forgone tax revenue in 2006 related to the exclusion from individual income of employer contributions to health benefits ranged from $ 91 billion (Joint Committee on Taxation) to $ 133 billion (Office of Management and the Budget). Major proposals—The most significant proposals for changing the tax status of health benefits are...|$|R

The frequency domain analysis shows that current receipts, personal <b>current</b> <b>tax,</b> taxes on production and imports and taxes on corporate income do not Granger-cause GDP, both at the short and high frequency level; however, <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> receipts Granger-cause GDP in the frequency range of (0. 9, 1. 9), corresponding to the cycle of to 3 months to 7 months. These results suggest that when the USA looks forward to rebalancing her GDP, by means of taxation, it is preferable to reconsider the tax structure {{with a focus on}} <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> receipts. This is so because by changing the structure of <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> receipts, the USA will be able to earn more revenue, even in the initial stage. However, if the USA decides to increase welfare, with the stability and sustainability of GDP, the policy makers are advised to readjust the tax burden by infusing the changes of the current receipts, personal <b>current</b> <b>tax,</b> taxes on production and imports and taxes on corporate income.

50|$|The <b>Current</b> <b>Tax</b> Payment Act of 1943, Pub. L. 68, Ch. 120, 57 Stat. 126 (June 9, 1943), re-introduced the {{requirement}} to withhold income tax in the United States. Tax withholding had been introduced in the Tariff Act of 1913 but repealed by the Income Tax Act of 1916. The <b>Current</b> <b>Tax</b> Payment Act compelled employers to withhold federal income taxes from workers' paychecks and pay them directly to the government on the workers' behalf. At {{the time of the}} act, Social Security payments and a World War II Victory Tax were already being withheld.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called income before tax, profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income before <b>tax</b> and <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax. If the tax expense exceeds the <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> payable {{then there is a}} deferred tax payable; if the <b>current</b> <b>tax</b> payable exceeds the tax expense then there is a deferred tax receivable.|$|R
