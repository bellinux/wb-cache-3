40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that the X-shaped structure in the Milky Way bulge can naturally arise from bar instability and buckling instability. To understand the influence of buckling amplitude on the morphology of the X-shape, we analyze three self-consistent numerical simulations of barred galaxies with different buckling amplitudes (strong, intermediate, and weak). We derive the three-dimensional density using an adaptive kernel smoothing technique. The face-on isodensity surfaces are all elliptical, while in the edge-on view, the morphology of buckled bars transitions with increasing radius from a central boxy core to a peanut bulge and then to an extended, thin bar. Based on these isodensity surfaces at different density levels, we find no clear evidence for a well-defined structure shaped like the letter X. The X-shaped structure is more peanut-like, the visual perception of which is probably enhanced by the pinched inner concave isodensity contours. The peanut bulge can reproduce qualitatively the observed bimodal distributions that were used as evidence for the discovery of the X-shape. The central boxy core is shaped like an <b>oblong</b> <b>tablet,</b> extending similar to 500 pc above and below the Galactic plane (|b| similar to 4 degrees). From the solar perspective, lines of sight passing through the central boxy core do not show bimodal distributions. This generally agrees with the observations that double peaks merge at |b| similar to 4 degrees- 5 degrees from the Galactic plane, indicating the presence of a possibly similar structure in the Galactic bulge...|$|E

40|$|At present, {{the ease}} of {{subdivision}} of scored tablets is estimated in vivo. In order to replace such in vivo testing {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease of subdivision was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease of subdivision in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored <b>oblong</b> <b>tablets,</b> the critical parameters for their ease of subdivision are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of score line and resistance to crushing. Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease of subdivision of scored <b>oblong</b> <b>tablets.</b> For scored round tablets the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease of subdivision, are: resistance to crushing, diameter, score mark (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable. For release testing and stability studies, resistance to crushing of a scored tablet is a reliable predictor of its ease of subdivision. © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to improve the hygrpscopicity and poor flow properties of the crude dry extract of the seeds of Glinus lotoides and improve the disintegration time of the core-tablets for enteric coated formulation thereof. The liquid crude extract of the plant was adsorbed on granulated colloidal silicon dioxide (Aeroperl® 300 Pharma) at 30 % w/w and the dry extract preparation (DEP) was dry-granulated with roller-compaction using Micro-Pactor®. Hygroscopicity, flow property and disintegration time were improved significantly due to the adsorption and granulation processes. Moreover, the DEP does not become mucilaginous even at higher relative humidity levels (above 65 %). <b>Oblong</b> <b>tablets</b> (20 [*]×[*] 8. 25  mm) containing 947  mg of the granulated DEP (equivalent to the traditional dose), 363  mg of Avicel® PH 101 and 90  mg of Ac-di-Sol® as disintegrant were formulated using an instrumented eccentric tablet machine at 20  kN. The tablets showed a crushing strength of 195  N, a friability of 0. 4 % and disintegrated within 9  min. The tablets were then enteric coated using polymethacrylate co-polymers (Eudragit® L 100 - 55 and Kollicoat® MAE 100 P). The coated tablets resisted disintegration or softening in simulated gastric fluid for a minimum of 2  h and disintegrated within 15  min in intestine simulated fluid at pH  6. 8. In addition to controlling the release of the active agents, the enteric coating improved the strength and decreased friability of the core-tablets...|$|R
5|$|The 26 rongorongo texts with letter {{codes are}} inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and {{components}} of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly <b>oblong</b> wooden <b>tablets,</b> with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain's staff {{known as the}} Santiago Staff; J and L, inscribed on reimiro pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, inscribed on various parts of a tangata manu ("birdman") statuette; and Y, a European snuff box assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.|$|R
40|$|A {{representative}} market surveillance study on break-mark tablets for human use, having a marketing authorization (MA) in The Netherlands (NL), was carried out. The uniformity of mass of subdivided break-mark tablets into halves was assessed according to Ph. Eur. 5. 5, now current; and for comparison also according to Ph. Eur. 4. 1 (no longer in force) and Pharmeuropa 16. 2. The compliance was 24 %, 14 % and 45 %, respectively. The compliance with a criterion for loss of mass by subdivision of break-mark tablets (or = 80 % of {{a panel of}} elderly able to break, > or = 90 % probability) was 34 %. Of the 29 studied tablets, 5 complied with all criteria, amongst which were all three <b>oblong</b> <b>tablets</b> that {{were included in the}} study. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the tablets was independently evaluated by experts to assess whether their break-mark was needed for the posology. The experts came to a uniform conclusion for only 66 % of the tablets. It is concluded that the proposed test procedures for ease of subdivision and loss of mass by subdivision are workable, that the proposed criteria are reasonable and that their inclusion in Ph. Eur. can be considered. From a pharmaceutical-technological point of view, the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5. 5 Subdivision of tablets for uniformity of mass of subdivided tablets, and the proposed criteria for ease of subdivision and loss of mass, are all simultaneously attainable. It is also concluded {{that the majority of the}} break-mark tablets with a MA in NL do not meet the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5. 5 Subdivision of tablets, and that they do not fulfill the proposed criterion for ease of subdivision. This is expected to also be the case in other countries. It is proposed that the test Ph. Eur. 5. 5 Subdivision of tablets should give instructions on how to handle tablets that cannot be broken, or that crumble upon subdivision. It is also proposed that the criteria Ph. Eur. 5. 5 Subdivision of tablets should not be restricted to break-marks needed for the posology, as dosing instructions in SmPCs are open to different interpretations, and that this restriction should be deleted...|$|R
