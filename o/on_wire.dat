40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{processor}} architecture for DR-SPE,a dynamic reconfigurable stream processing engine. DR-SPE is specialpurposehardware for stream data processing, which achieves highprocessing performance by exploiting parallelism {{in the target}} query.

Available operations in DR-SPE {{are the same as}} those inStreams <b>on</b> <b>Wires.</b> In this paper, DR-SPE is implemented on a FPGAXC 6 VLX 240 T- 1, and its performance is evaluated. The results of theevaluation show that DR-SPE achieves register modification within 506 sec when the configuration path is driven at 1 Mbps, which is notachieved by Streams <b>on</b> <b>Wires.</b> DR-SPE also achieves flexibility and cansupport complicated queries by providing 10 10 operation units tiledonto an FPGA. DR-SPE achieves comparable operation throughput withStreams <b>on</b> <b>Wires</b> at the expense of requiring more LUTs...|$|R
