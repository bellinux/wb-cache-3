The power series expansion of the arctangent function is sometimes called Madhava-Gregory <b>series</b> <b>or</b> Gregory-Madhava <b>series.</b> These power series are also collectively called Taylor-Madhava series. The formula for π is referred to as Madhava-Newton <b>series</b> <b>or</b> Madhava-Leibniz <b>series</b> <b>or</b> Leibniz formula for pi <b>or</b> Leibnitz-Gregory-Madhava <b>series.</b> [...] These further names for the various series are reflective of the names of the Western discoverers or popularizers of the respective series.|$|R
