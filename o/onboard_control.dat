50|$|RCM {{is capable}} of {{generating}} autonomic wing beating from a chemical energy source. It {{can also be used}} to provide a small amount of electricity to the <b>onboard</b> <b>control</b> systems. It further helps in differential lift enhancement on the wings to achieve roll, pitch, and hence, steered flight. The RCM technique is particularly useful in the manufacturing of insect-like micro air vehicles. The first generation of RCMs was large and had a reciprocating frequency around 10 Hz. The later generations developed were very much smaller and lighter. Also, the reciprocating frequency of this generation RCM was as high as 60 Hz. The reciprocating chemical muscle was invented by Prof. Robert C. Michelson of the Georgia Tech Research Institute and implemented up through its fourth generation by Nino Amarena of ETS Laboratories.|$|E
50|$|Having {{survived the}} Depression, Minneapolis-Honeywell was {{approached}} by the US military for engineering and manufacturing projects. In 1941, Minneapolis-Honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers, {{as well as the}} C-1 autopilot. The C-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort, and was used on the two B-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. The success of these projects led Minneapolis-Honeywell to open an Aero division in Chicago on October 5, 1942. This division was responsible {{for the development of the}} formation stick to control autopilots, more accurate gas gauges for planes, and the turbo supercharger. In 1950, Minneapolis-Honeywell’s Aero division was contracted for the controls on the first US nuclear submarine, USS Nautilus. The following year, the company acquired Intervox Company for their sonar, ultrasonics, and telemetry technologies. Honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the RUR-5 ASROC for the US Navy.In 1953, in cooperation with the USAF Wright-Air Development Center, Honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight, from taxiing, to takeoff, to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing. Called the Automatic Master Sequence Selector, the <b>onboard</b> <b>control</b> operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircraft's autopilot at certain way points during the flight, significantly reducing the pilot's workload. Technologically, this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in missile guidance and numerical control. Honeywell also developed the Wagtail missile with the USAF.|$|E

40|$|Using small spacecrafts for a {{wide range}} of {{research}} and applied purposes is one of the major trends in the aerospace field. Modular-network architectures implemented on the “system-on-chip” hardware platform provide required characteristics of <b>onboard</b> <b>control</b> systems. Selecting this system architecture significantly increases demands on very large-scale integration (VLSI) design efficiency and project solution quality. In this paper, we propose a new approach to VLSI high-level synthesis based on a functional-flow parallel computing model. The modified VLSI design flow uses a functional-flow parallel programming language Pythagoras, which allows describing a VLSI operation algorithm with the maximal degree of parallelism. An offered intermediate representation of VLSI architecture in the form of a control-flow graph and a data-flow graph provides an opportunity for synthesizing circuits and verifying projects on the stage of a formal description, without returning to previous hierarchical levels of the project. A set of software tools supporting new design process is developed. The proposed technology is successfully tested on the example of a digital signal processing function. Further, this technology is suggested for use in the synthesis of <b>onboard</b> <b>control</b> system components for small spacecrafts...|$|E
