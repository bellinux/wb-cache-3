40|$|Searching is {{the process}} of seeking a desired element in a set of related elements. The task <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> is one <b>of</b> the most {{frequent}} operations in computer science. There exist several basic variations of the theme <b>of</b> <b>searching,</b> and many different approaches, data structures and algorithms have been developed on this subject. basedOn data stored data auxiliary data structures searches exploits searching searching algorithm reorganizes physical world digital world data need query S e a r c h i n g user submits user/ application Figure 1 The basic components <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> in the natural and the digital world Figure 1 describes graphically the basic components <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> in the natural and the digital world. In our natural world, a human having an information need is searching a data set. In the digital world, an information need (or query) of a user or application is searched over a data set stored in computer memory. An algorithm is used to carry out the task <b>of</b> <b>searching.</b> As searching is a very frequent operation, in many cases the data is structured and stored in such a way so that to facilitate the task <b>of</b> <b>searching.</b> However the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> is not the only factor that determines the structuring of data. Other factors are the storage space required, the efficiency of updating, etc. As a consequence, in many cases auxiliary data structures are created and maintained in order to speed up the task <b>of</b> <b>searching.</b> These auxiliary data structures store data, which are derived from the original data set and are exploited by the searching algorithm in order to speed up searching...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, efforts {{started to}} attempt {{reform of the}} law. Following the {{prosecution}} of several notable publishers, the Society of Authors formed a committee (with Norman St John-Stevas as legal advisor) to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting their proposals and a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. Instead of the wholesale reform the Society hoped for, the government instead chose limited reform through the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955 dealing with horror comics, which kept the Hicklin test but required that the work as a whole be examined. The Society and sympathetic Members of Parliament then attempted to introduce a Private Member's Bill, but this was quashed by the ensuing general election. Another Private Member's Bill was successfully introduced in March 1957 and sent to a committee. Composed of a mix of censors and reformers, the committee's recommendations were mixed, consisting of both conservative (further powers <b>of</b> <b>search</b> and seizure for the police) and liberal (the use of expert evidence attesting to the work's artistic merit) proposals.|$|E

Auza, who commands the Incubus Brood and is responsible for reconnaissance, attempts to personally assimilate a rebel Terran psychic, but is overwhelmed as the psychic's mind overcomes its own. As a result, the Overmind is forced to kill Auza. Retribution introduces Zargil of the Sennith Brood, who relays the Overmind's directives to the player. Various other cerebrates are also featured throughout the series, though {{following the death of}} the second Overmind, Metzen explained that all remaining extant cerebrates died, as they were not designed to live without their creator or killed by Kerrigan herself and absorbing their warriors to her side.|$|E
