2500|$|A {{more complex}} {{version of a}} Tesla coil, termed a [...] "magnifier" [...] by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core {{resonance}} [...] "driver" [...] transformer (or [...] "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> (called the [...] "extra coil" [...] or simply the resonator) that has {{a large number of}} turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected {{to the bottom of the}} extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1" [...] diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to [...] "ring up" [...] to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning [...] "modes" [...] are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.|$|E
5000|$|This {{represents}} {{a slightly more}} complex system for rung 2. After the first line has been evaluated, the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> [...] "A/C" [...] is fed into rung 2, which is then evaluated and the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> [...] "Cooling" [...] could be fed into an output device [...] "Compressor" [...] or into rung 3 on the ladder.This system allows very complex logic designs to be broken down and evaluated.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} high-speed generator is {{the permanent}} magnet magneto. Achieving the output needed {{depends on the}} use of modern rare earth magnets, such as samarium cobalt or neodymium. The <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> is formed as a stator, with axial magnetic flux from a rotating multi-pole ring magnet.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, complex {{ladder logic}} is 'read' {{left to right}} and top to bottom. As each of the lines (or rungs) are {{evaluated}} the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> of a rung may feed into {{the next stage of}} the ladder as an input. In a complex system there will be many [...] "rungs" [...] on a ladder, which are numbered in order of evaluation.Line 1 realizes the function: A/C = Switch AND ( [...] HiTemp OR Humid [...] ) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} {{itself can}} be seen as a set of connections between logical checkers (contacts) and actuators (coils). If a path can be traced between the left side of the rung and the output, through asserted (true or [...] "closed") contacts, the rung is true and the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> storage bit is asserted (1) or true. If no path can be traced, then the output is false (0) and the [...] "coil" [...] by analogy to electromechanical relays is considered [...] "de-energized". The analogy between logical propositions and relay contact status is due to Claude Shannon.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} {{the peak voltage}} induced in a sensing loop by a Magstim 200 magnetic stimulator. <b>Coil</b> <b>output</b> varied little for repeated stimulation at the same intensity {{over a wide range}} of <b>coil</b> <b>output.</b> In contrast, the first stimulus immediately after a change in intensity was of larger amplitude and showed greater variability than subsequent stimuli. The effect was seen for changes in intensity of 5 % and 60 % and was greater for reductions than for increases in stimulation intensity. Stimulation immediately after a reduction in intensity from 100 % to 40 % resulted in peak induced voltages as high as those recorded for repeated stimulation at 43 % of maximum <b>coil</b> <b>output.</b> Increased <b>coil</b> <b>output</b> following changes in stimulation intensity may affect measurement of the threshold for motor cortical stimulation. The effect of a change in intensity could be minimized by delaying stimulation for at least 30 s or discarding the first stimulus after the chang...|$|R
50|$|This {{ignition}} system uses an ignition coil wound as an autotransformer {{to step up}} the voltage from the 12 volts supplied by the battery (itself supplied, once the engine starts, by the alternator or dynamo in older vehicles). When the points close, current flows through the primary (input) side of the coil, which has a few hundred turns of wire, creating a magnetic field. When the points open, interrupting the current, this field collapses and as it does the lines of flux cut across the secondary (<b>output)</b> <b>coil</b> which has several thousand turns of very fine wire, inducing an open-circuit voltage {{in the range of}} 15 to 30 thousand volts at the coil output terminal. This high voltage pulse is carried by the coil wire to the center terminal of the distributor cap.|$|E
50|$|A {{fluxgate}} magnetometer {{consists of}} a small, magnetically susceptible core wrapped by two coils of wire. An alternating electric current is passed through one coil, driving the core through an alternating cycle of magnetic saturation; i.e., magnetised, unmagnetised, inversely magnetised, unmagnetised, magnetised, and so forth. This constantly changing field induces an electric current in the second coil, and this output current is measured by a detector. In a magnetically neutral background, the input and output currents match. However, when the core is exposed to a background field, it is more easily saturated in alignment with that field and less easily saturated in opposition to it. Hence the alternating magnetic field, and the induced output current, are {{out of step with}} the input current. The extent to which this is the case depends on the strength of the background magnetic field. Often, the current in the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> is integrated, yielding an output analog voltage, proportional to the magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{developments}} in magnetic {{materials such as}} samarium-cobalt, an early rare-earth type, allowed permanent magnet alternators to be used where an extremely robust generator is required. In guided missiles, such generators may replace the flux switching alternator. These need to operate at high speeds, directly coupled to a turbine.

The monitor utilizes an inductance-capacitance (L-C) oscillator in which the C comprises a variable capacitance transducer, one electrode {{of which is a}} small stiff pressure responsive diaphragm. The oscillator is isolated from a transmitting tank circuit by a buffer circuit and all electric components in the implanted unit except an input and an <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> are shielded by a metal housing...|$|E
5000|$|The pre-amplifiers are {{designed}} to accept signals from source components without overloading, and Naim claims total stability and a very wide open-loop bandwidth. The half-size pre-amplifiers were modular, consisting of a mother board for higher-level signals into which are plugged various daughter boards that deal with lower-level signals such as phono and tape. Phono boards are plug-in modules {{to provide for the}} gain and equalisation of the cartridge output to line level, and some of the earlier pre-amplifiers may be suffixed with [...] "N", [...] "S", or [...] "K" [...] depending on the phono boards carried.

Moreover, all the possibilities for time development of the <b>output</b> voltage and <b>coil</b> current are classified by using differential wave forms of them. Based on these results, flow charts for making a numerical computation program are composed. The transient characteristics of this power supply is analyzed in detail by using this program. Moreover, the validity of these analytical results is experimentally clarified, and the correctness of this analytical method is verified...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} a voltage source {{inverter}} depends on its output filter. The parameters of this filter can differ significantly from their nominal values due to power losses {{in the core of}} the <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> and changes in its inductance. Only Multi-Input-Single-Output control systems can effectively reduce inverter output voltage distortions for a standard nonlinear rectifier RC load. However, their design requires knowledge of the actual values of the inverter parameters. The novelty of the paper is that it connects the designs of two MISO control systems with a method of the automated measurements of the voltage source inverter parameters. The breadboard verification is also included...|$|E
40|$|The neutron spin is a {{critical}} degree of freedom for many precision measurements using low-energy neutrons. Fundamental symmetries and interactions can be studied using polarized neutrons. Parity-violation (PV) in the hadronic weak interaction {{and the search for}} exotic forces that depend on the relative spin and velocity, are two questions of fundamental physics that can be studied via the neutron spin rotations that arise from the interaction of polarized cold neutrons and unpolarized matter. The Neutron Spin Rotation (NSR) collaboration developed a neutron polarimeter, capable of determining neutron spin rotations of the order of 10 ^- 7 rad per meter of traversed material. This paper describes two key components of the NSR apparatus, responsible for the transport and manipulation of the spin of the neutrons before and after the target region, which is surrounded by magnetic shielding and where residual magnetic fields need to be below 100 G. These magnetic field devices, called input and output coils, provide the magnetic field for adiabatic transport of the neutron spin in the regions outside the magnetic shielding while producing a sharp nonadiabatic transition of the neutron spin when entering/exiting the low-magnetic-field region. In addition, the coils are self contained, forcing the return magnetic flux into a compact region of space to minimize fringe fields outside. The design of the input and <b>output</b> <b>coil</b> is based on the magnetic scalar potential method...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first portable, binaural, {{real-time}} research platform compatible with Oticon Medical SP and XP generation cochlear implants. The platform consists of (a) {{a pair of}} behind-the-ear devices, each containing front and rear calibrated microphones, (b) a four-channel USB analog-to-digital converter, (c) real-time PC-based sound processing software called the Master Hearing Aid, and (d) USB-connected hardware and <b>output</b> <b>coils</b> capable of driving two implants simultaneously. The platform is capable of processing signals from the four microphones simultaneously and producing synchronized binaural cochlear implant outputs that drive two (bilaterally implanted) SP or XP implants. Both audio signal preprocessing algorithms (such as binaural beamforming) and novel binaural stimulation strategies (within the implant limitations) can be programmed by researchers. When the whole research platform is combined with Oticon Medical SP implants, interaural electrode timing can be controlled on individual electrodes to within Â± 1 [*]Âµs and interaural electrode energy differences can be controlled to within Â± 2 %. Hence, this new platform is particularly well suited to performing experiments related to interaural time differences in combination with interaural level differences in real-time. The platform also supports instantaneously variable stimulation rates and thereby enables investigations such as the effect of changing the stimulation rate on pitch perception. Because the processing can be changed on the fly, researchers can use this platform to study perceptual changes resulting from different processing strategies acutely...|$|R
50|$|If {{the engine}} was rotated while {{examining}} the wave-form <b>output</b> of the <b>coil</b> with an oscilloscope, it {{would appear to be}} AC. Since the charge-time of the coil corresponds to much less than a full revolution of the crank, the coil really 'sees' only DC current for charging the external ignition coil.|$|R
25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} isolation transformer, and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and <b>output</b> transformer <b>coils.</b> Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the contact breaker is to {{interrupt}} the current flowing in the primary circuit of the ignition coil.

50|$|Since {{they open}} and close several times with every turn of the engine, contact breaker points and cam {{follower}} suffer from wearâboth mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breakerâthis is usually referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the <b>coil</b> <b>output</b> by creating a resonant LC circuit with the coil windings.|$|R
30|$|The {{benefit of}} the present system is that it uses a {{commercial}} pulse magnetizer, an instrument available in many paleomagnetism laboratories. Users have only to attach the sensing coil set into the sample cavity of the pulse magnet. The adoption of the analog circuit for preprocessing the <b>coil</b> <b>output</b> improved the sensitivity and made the following numerical processing flexible. We {{used in this study}} a digital oscilloscope for the data acquisition, but this can instead be accomplished with a fast data logger at a more reasonable cost.|$|R
50|$|If {{the burden}} {{resistance}} {{is much less}} than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that {{is proportional to the}} measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential <b>output.</b> The Rogowski <b>coil</b> uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current.|$|R
