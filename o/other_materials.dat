5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. <b>Other</b> <b>materials</b> being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the notable}} {{artificial}} {{structures in the}} TMD are ramadas, picnic tables, and restrooms built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1941. Designed to conform to their natural surrounds, the rustic buildings consist mainly of quarried stone and <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> native to the area.|$|E
5|$|An earlier major {{application}} of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes {{because of its}} hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by <b>other</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas {{it might be possible}} to scratch some diamonds with <b>other</b> <b>materials,</b> such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E
5|$|Kari Hauge {{became the}} first {{librarian}} of the new facility. In addition to offering the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and <b>other</b> <b>materials,</b> the Woodstock Library houses collections in Chinese and Spanish and employs Chinese-speaking staff. Self-checkout stations and radio frequency identification gates were installed in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|Many {{licensed}} products {{are based on}} the Star Trek franchise. Merchandising is very lucrative for both studio and actors; by 1986 Nimoy had earned more than $500,000 from royalties. Products include novels, comic books, video games, and <b>other</b> <b>materials,</b> which are generally considered non-canon. Star Trek merchandise generated $4 billion for Paramount by 2002.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>materials</b> {{are often}} {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and {{manganese}} in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 has a {{conventional}} aerodynamic layout with a shoulder-mounted trapezoidal wing and a traditional tailplane and rudder.

5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within {{the outer edge of}} the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is the largest of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of <b>other</b> <b>materials.</b> Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
