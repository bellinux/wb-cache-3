5|$|To {{maintain}} {{continuity between}} the two media, Lima brought in costume designer Mona May {{during the early stages}} of the film's production so the costumes would be aligned in both the animated and live-action worlds.

Test scenes completed by the animators were shown to the actors, allowing them to see how their animated self would move.|$|E

5|$|Other {{stories for}} the {{character}} include blackmail, one-night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant by the serial's villain Cain Dingle. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the fear of losing her new-found family increases. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Jane Simon from the Daily Mail said her first scenes resembled a horror movie, while her colleague Jaci Stephen has opined that Amy wears too much make-up. However, entertainment website Digital Spy has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three Best Newcomer awards for her portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Amy.</b> Halfpenny announced her departure from Emmerdale in October 2013. She departed on 14 November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Amy caused {{at least}} an {{estimated}} $30million in damage throughout the central Philippines. However, {{the total number of}} fatalities directly associated with the effects of the typhoon remain disputed, and may range anywhere from 569 to 991, making Amy one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the island nation in recorded history. An additional 50,000people were rendered homeless by the storm. The typhoon was characterized by the Philippine weather bureau to be the worst typhoon to strike the Philippines in at least 70years. In the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>Amy,</b> then-president of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino declared a state of public calamity for eleven central Philippine provinces including the island of Camiguin, which was heavily affected by both the typhoon and Mount Hibok-Hibok. On December24, the American Red Cross granted $25,000to the Philippine Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer <b>of</b> <b>Amy</b> Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|In the South of China Sea on December11, Amy quickly slowed in {{forward motion}} {{and began to}} execute a {{cyclonic}} loop. Late that day, the typhoon strengthened back to Category2 intensity, and as such concurrently attained a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg). Late on December13, Amy weakened back to a Category1 typhoon for a transient period of time before restrengthening and reaching a quaternary peak intensity as a Category3 typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). Afterwards, the typhoon began to weaken, and at 0900UTC on December17, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam issued their last bulletin on the tropical cyclone. Upon the issuance of the last advisory, Amy set records for most typhoon bulletins issued at 58, and most reconnaissance fixes at 25. However, Amy continued to persist through the next day before degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area late on December18. The following day, the associated remnants <b>of</b> <b>Amy</b> dissipated east of Vietnam.|$|E
