50|$|By {{the early}} Achaemenid period, a king {{preparing}} {{to participate in}} a military expedition, was required to appoint his heir, in case the king would die. Usually the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>heir</b> was based on his ancestry, physical quality, and leadership features.|$|R

50|$|Unavailability (or inalienability) of {{the crown}}: the crown {{is not the}} {{personal}} property of the king, therefore, nobody, not even the king himself, can alter the line of succession by abdication, renunciation, or <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>heir</b> <b>of</b> his own choosing. This argument is crucial for legitimists regarding the continuing validity {{of the rights of}} succession of the Spanish line of Philip V and his descendants. According to this view, Philip's renunciation of his rights of succession to the French throne in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 was null and void, and therefore his descendants still retain their claim to the French throne ahead of the Orléans line.|$|R
5000|$|Inheritance of this {{property}} {{was based on}} direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon {{the death of their}} parents. Furthermore, a man's will or <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> a different <b>heir</b> could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs. [...] Despite the law's equitable wording on property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the sources of}} the laws regulating the procedure of disinheritance in Justinian law suggests that those laws originated in pre-Justinian times. Justinian’s contribution to the regulation of the form in which disinheritance may be conducted was twofold: on the one hand, Justinian relaxed the existing legal requirements, and on the other, he replaced them with new requirements which, since his times on have been used to ensure better protection <b>of</b> the statutory <b>heirs</b> against unjust disinheritance. Justinian law, similarly to the old civil law and praetorian law required that the testator observed a very strict form if he wished to disinherit a statutory heir, to be reflected in the last will and testament, or the requirement of the disinheritance nominatim. Justinian advocated a far reaching flexibility of the strict regulations as to the placement of the disinheritance decision in the testament, and, in particular, he revoked the rigorous form of exheros esto that had been absolutely binding until 531. Like the old jurists, he also rejected the possibility of disinheriting with the use of accidentalia negotti. He upheld the requirement that disinheritance must apply to the entire estate and excluded the possibility of valid disinheritance without an <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> another <b>heir.</b> Justinian added the requirement of naming all potential heirs, and the requirement of stating the reason for disinheritance if no legitim was stipulated...|$|R
