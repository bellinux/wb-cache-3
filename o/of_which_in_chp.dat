40|$|That {{the allied}} {{countries}} ended up the {{victory in the}} II nd World War(in other words the democracy side ended up the victory in the war), lead to the single-party systems to be disgraced and caused the free-election based democracy to appear and flourish. This new international atmosphere, that supported the political lib-eration, affected not only {{the party in power}} but also the opposition that had started to become evident. As a result of this progress a proposal, known as “Four Proposals” demanding a wider application of democratic methods in our country was given to CHP on 7. June 1945 by Celal Bayar, Adnan Menderes, Fuat Köprülü and Refik Koraltan, who were later to be the founders of the Democratic Party. This proposal, <b>which</b> was discussed <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> on 12 June 1945 and was rejected by the vote of all members of the Grand National Assembly except from those four who had given it, gave the opposition <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> a chance to become evident. Also these members (of the Grand National As-sembly) who were considered as apposing had the opportunity to announce their point of view to the public opinion by means of the proposal. In the forthcoming period, these members having the proposal were to be dis-missed or to separate from CHP and to found the Democratic Party...|$|R

40|$|Combined Heat and Power (CHP), {{also known}} as cogeneration, refers to one of several {{technologies}} that allow a facility to generate electricity and useful heat simultaneously.

30|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} and thresholding errors on HP estimation have to be examined together. The digital number (also known as the greyness scale number) of all pixels <b>in</b> <b>CHPs</b> increases with exposure (Zhang et al. 2005). Nevertheless, as long as exposure is not high enough to cause the so-called blooming effect (Leblanc et al. 2005), the effects of higher exposure on HP estimates can be cancelled out by using higher threshold values <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> analysis (Song et al. 2014). In other words, an estimation inaccuracy cannot be introduced to HP by either exposure or thresholding errors alone, but by the mismatch between exposure and thresholding (hereafter, exposure-thresholding mismatch, ETM).|$|R

40|$|Fuel cells produce heat when {{generating}} electricity, {{thus they}} are of particular interest for {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) and combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) applications, also known as tri-generation systems. CHP and tri-generation systems offer high energy conversion efficiency and hence the potential to reduce fuel costs and CO 2 emissions. This article serves to provide a state-of-the-art review of fuel cell technology operating in the domestic built environment <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> and tri-generation system applications. The review aims to carry out an assessment of the following topics: (1) the operational advantages fuel cells offer <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> and tri-generation system configurations, specifically, compared to conventional combustion-based technologies such as Stirling engines, (2) how decarbonisation, running cost and energy security in the domestic built environment may be addressed through the use of fuel cell technology, and (3) what has been done to date and {{what needs to be done}} in the future. The article commences with a review of fuel cell technology, then moves on to examine fuel cell <b>CHP</b> systems operating <b>in</b> the domestic built environment, and finally explores fuel cell tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications. The article concludes with an assessment of the present development of, and future challenges for, domestic fuel cells operating <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> and tri-generation systems. As fuel cells are an emergent technology the article draws on a breadth of literature, data and experience, mostly from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, America and Australia. Fuel cells are a technology of the future here today, providing a change in the way heat and power are supplied to end users. Fuel cells operating <b>in</b> <b>CHP</b> and tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications could finally provide the means by which energy generation can transfer from centralised to decentralised locales in a sustainable and effective manner...|$|R
