5|$|Fertilisation of <b>Orchids</b> {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign <b>orchids</b> are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic <b>orchids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green <b>orchids,</b> but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic <b>orchids,</b> respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica and closely related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes of the same species have distinct Russula partners.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild <b>orchids,</b> showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of <b>Orchids</b> gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this seems}} unlikely, given {{that no one}} has ever {{documented}} that female euglossines produce pheromones; male euglossines produce pheromones using the chemicals they collect from <b>orchids,</b> and these pheromones attract females, rather than the converse, as Cullina (2004) suggests.|$|E

5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. <b>Orchids</b> are common, and rare varieties of <b>orchids</b> are featured in flower shows in the city.

5|$|Plants are not passive, but {{respond to}} {{external}} signals such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards {{or away from}} the stimulus, as appropriate.

5|$|The {{book was}} his first {{detailed}} demonstration {{of the power of}} natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of <b>orchids</b> and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. <b>Orchids</b> was {{the first in a series}} of books on his innovative investigations into plants.|$|E
