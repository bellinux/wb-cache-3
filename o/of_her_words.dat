However, she upsets him {{at a press conference}} by {{suggesting}} a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior, and her comments cause tension between predators and prey throughout the city. Feeling guilty for the results <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words,</b> Judy quits her job.|$|E
500|$|On Valentine's Day in 1921, while Scott {{was working}} {{to finish his}} second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, Zelda {{discovered}} she was pregnant. They {{decided to go to}} Scott's home in St. Paul, Minnesota to have the baby. On October 26, 1921, she gave birth to Frances [...] "Scottie" [...] Fitzgerald. As she emerged from the anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, [...] "Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it's beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool." [...] Many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> found their way into Scott's novels: in The Great Gatsby, the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter.|$|E
500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E

500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E
2500|$|The {{statements}} made by Lipstadt were clearly defamatory, and the defence could not claim that they were misinterpreted. Therefore, if the defence could not prove the defamatory content <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words</b> to be true, they would be found guilty of libel. Lipstadt feared that such a verdict would confer legitimacy upon Irving's claims, and so felt compelled to defend herself. Of this situation, one commentator, who had initially expressed the opinion that Irving [...] "could have been ignored", later wrote [...] "Lipstadt {{had no choice but}} to defend herself in court." ...|$|E

25|$|Episkoposes are the Overseers of sects of Discordianism, {{who have}} presumably {{created their own}} sect of Discordianism. They speak to Eris {{through the use of}} their pineal gland.

She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of what she says is equally <b>her</b> <b>word</b> (even if it contradicts another iteration <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>word).</b>|$|R

[...] says it was an idle saying suggested by Bassett's praising the lady Anne and dispraising the Queen that now is. Never spoke {{at any other time}} of the lady Anne, and she thinks the King's divorce from her good. Examined why she said, [...] "What a man is the King! How many wives will he have?" [...] She said it upon the sudden tidings declared to her by Bassett, when she was sorry for the change and knew not so much as she knows now".|$|E
2500|$|Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media {{selected}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] as {{a song of}} the day, {{claiming it}} served as a reaffirmation of popular music: [...] "Sometimes, pop music can still break your heart." [...] Writing for BBC Online, Ian Wade noted that the [...] "final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener {{in one of those}} moments where you feel you're {{in the presence of a}} future standard." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>words,</b> the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E
