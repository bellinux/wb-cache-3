40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of mechanical/microstructural evaluation, thermal shock/fatigue testing, and stress analyses of advanced hot-gas filters obtained from different manufacturers. These filters were fabricated from both monolithic ceramics and composites. The composite filters, made of both oxide and nonoxide materials, were in both as-fabricated and exposed conditions, whereas the monolithic filters were made only of nonoxide materials. Mechanical property measurement of composite filters included diametral compression testing with O-ring specimens and burst-testing of short filter segments with rubber plugs. In-situ strength of fibers in the composite filters was evaluated by microscopic technique. Thermal shock/fatigue resistance was estimated by measuring the strengths of filter specimens before and after thermal cycling from an air environment at elevated temperatures to a room temperature <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> <b>Filter</b> performance during mechanical and thermal shock/fatigue loadings was correlated with microstructural observations. Micromechanical models were developed to derive properties of composite filter constituents on the basis of measured mechanical properties of the filters. Subsequently, these properties were used to analytically predict the performance of composite filters during thermal shock loading...|$|E
50|$|Some buildings, {{as well as}} {{aircraft}} and other human-made environments (e.g., satellites and space shuttles) use foam, pleated paper, or spun fiberglass filter elements. Another method, air ionisers, use fibers or elements with a static electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of internal combustion engines and air compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or cotton <b>filters.</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>bath</b> <b>filters</b> have fallen out of favor. The technology of air intake filters of gas turbines has improved significantly in recent years, due to improvements in the aerodynamics and fluid dynamics of the air-compressor part of the gas turbines.|$|R
50|$|A 7 {{miles long}} {{standard}} gauge line {{was built in}} 1974 from the power plant to the Hosteen stockpile. The line was expanded to the present 14 miles in 1983. Since there is not connection {{to the rest of}} the railroad network, the 3 diesel locomotives and 22 Maxon bottom dump coal hopper cars had to be transported from Gallup on low-bed trucks to the Navajo Mine Railroad. At the beginning only one train was operated. There were problems with clogged <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> <b>filters</b> on the diesel locomotives due to excessive coal dust, but the issues could be solved with a new filter type.|$|R
50|$|Another {{use of an}} <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is to <b>filter</b> {{particulates}} out of air, {{by leading}} the air stream through an (unheated) <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> This type of air filter was used in car engines, but {{has been replaced by}} modern paper air filters. In some cases <b>oil</b> <b>baths</b> are used to heat bearings so they (the bearings) expand before installing them on shafts of aircraft engines.|$|R

5000|$|For the {{mechanical}} upgrade, work {{began with the}} engine, in accordance to the new standard now known as ZMZ-402. This produced , but needed 92 octane petrol. The other option was the ZMZ 4021, which gave [...] but only needed the more common 76 octane. The main novelty of the ZMZ-4022 was stratified charge ignition. This was immediately ruled out, due to its complication for the mass-produced car. Other changes, however, were retained. These included fingerless crankshaft bearing caps, new cast iron camshaft supports with no bushings, inlet and outlet valves of increased diameter with double-wound-springs, a new water pump, vibration dampener on the crankshaft pulley, contactless ignition system with a new alternator, new spark plugs, and an upgraded K-126GM carburettor. Some cars would feature the K-151 carburettor with a paper air filter (as opposed to the traditional <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> <b>filters),</b> and an idle fuel cutoff solenoid with exhaust gas recirculation. These would often carry the aluminium cylinder block from the ZMZ-4022. Power was now [...] 0 to 100 km/h took 19 seconds, top speed was 147 km/h, and fuel economy [...] The GAZ-3102's braking system was also improved, with atandem brake cylinder that featuring a dual-chambered vacuum servo and pressure regulator on the rear brakes; the 3102's front disk brakes were left out. The 3.9:1 rear axle, clutch and 205/70R14 radial tyres with [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub cups were also carried across. The dashboard and steering wheel were also from the 3102 parts bin.|$|R
50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> {{is a type}} {{of heated}} bath used in a laboratory. These baths are {{commonly}} used to heat reaction mixtures. An <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is essentially a container of oil that is heated by a hot plate. Generally, silicone oil is used in modern <b>oil</b> <b>baths,</b> although mineral <b>oil,</b> cottonseed oil and even phosphoric acid have been used in the past.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> air <b>filter.</b> The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R

25|$|A basic {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} {{for the analysis}} of crystalline solids consists of an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> with a transparent window (most basic design: a Thiele tube) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|R
2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> for better <b>filtering</b> performance.|$|R

30|$|Polyethylene {{glycol monomethyl ether}} 5000 (PEG) (Aldrich) {{with narrow}} {{molecular}} weight distribution (PDI =  1.06) was employed to grow single crystals. The self-seeding technique was applied for growing single crystals. Solution crystallization was carried out with a dilute concentration of 0.008  wt% in amyl acetate as solvent, and melt crystallization was conducted without solvent and on appropriate silicon wafers. The sample was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  42 °C) in solution system and melting temperature in bulk system (T m =  65 °C) in a temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> for 15  min. Then it was transferred to a 0 °C bath lasting 5  h for fast crystallization and, subsequently, immersed into a given self-seeding temperature <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> and kept for 20  min. The sample was then quickly switched into a desired isothermal <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> adjusted at crystallization temperature, and maintained for 2  days. Self-seeding method was also used to grow the single-co-crystals. Solution single crystallization {{was carried out in}} amyl acetate (Merck, > 98 %). Desired amount of solutes (50 / 50 wt/wt of homo and copolymer) and amyl acetate were added into the cell tube to reach the dilute concentration of 0.018  wt%. Then the sealed cell tube was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  65  °C) in a temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> and kept for about 12  min. Then cell tube was switched to another <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> at present − 10  °C lasting 5  h for crystallization. The cell tube was then immersed into a given self-seeding temperature (T s) <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> (T s =  41  °C), and kept for 15  min. The cell tube was then quickly transferred into an isothermal <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> preset at a given crystallization temperature (T c), and maintained for 2 – 3  days.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century (about 1900 to 1930), water bath air {{cleaners}} {{were used in}} some applications (cars, trucks, tractors, and portable and stationary engines). They worked on roughly the same principles as <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> air cleaners. For example, the original Fordson tractor had a water bath air cleaner. By the 1940s, <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> designs had displaced water bath designs because of better filtering performance.|$|R

30|$|Figure  2 a {{shows the}} {{temperature}} profiles for a 5  mL sample of ethanol boiled at 160 °C {{in a single}} mode closed vessel microwave irradiation and open vessel <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating conditions. The temperature profiles show that microwave heating method allows for rapid increase of solvent temperature and quick cooling as well, whereas in conventional heating (<b>oil</b> <b>bath)</b> rate of heating and cooling are very slow. Figure  2 b shows thermal behavior of microwave versus <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating. Temperature gradients shown in Figure  2 b suggest that microwave irradiation rises {{the temperature of the}} whole volume evenly and simultaneously whereas in <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating the reaction mixture in contact with the vessel wall is heated first. Inverted thermal gradient differences can be observed between the two heating methods [33 – 35]. The advantages of this enabling technology have more recently also been exploited in the context of multistep total synthesis and medicinal chemistry/ drug discovery and have additionally penetrated fields such as polymer synthesis, 6 material sciences, nanotechnology, and biochemical processes [36].|$|R
