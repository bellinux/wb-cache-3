50|$|The Rocky Face Fault is a {{geological}} fault responsible, in part, for {{the location}} of Cumberland Gap at Cumberland Mountain and the Narrows gap at Pine Mountain in the southern Appalachian mountain range. The fact that these two gaps lined up enabled western migration across the Appalachians to Kentucky. Included along the fault are the towns of Middlesboro and Pineville, Kentucky. The fault represents {{a crack in the}} Cumberland <b>Overthrust</b> <b>Sheet,</b> one of many remnant resistant strata pushed upwards to the northwest over the neighboring Cumberland Plateau. The fault is named after Rocky Face, a prominent, cliff-lined mountain between Middlesboro and Pineville, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|Cumberland Mountain {{is part of}} the Cumberland <b>Overthrust</b> <b>Sheet</b> or {{block and}} is the {{northern}} limb of the Powell Valley Anticline, a ramp anticline. The ridge exists because hard Lee-type sandstones of Early Pennsylvanian Age crop out along this line. Softer rocks have been eroded away, leaving the resistant sandstones to form a ridge. The southwestern terminus of Cumberland Mountain is marked by the northwest-trending Jacksboro Fault, a lateral ramp fault (part of the Pine Mountain Thrust Fault). The northwestern terminus is located near Norton, Virginia where the hard sandstones dip below the surface as the axis of the Powell Valley anticline plunges to the northeast. The various gaps in Cumberland Mountain are caused by rock weaknesses at cross-cutting faults or joints. For example, Cumberland Gap was caused by erosion along the cross-cutting Rocky Face Fault.|$|E
40|$|Large {{structural}} faults create serious {{ground control}} hazards, {{as well as}} adversely affect coal mineproduction. Two faults related to the Pine Mountain <b>overthrust</b> <b>sheet</b> in Buchanan County, VA, were investigated by the U. S. Bureau of Mines to determine their effect on ground control and to develop recognition criteria for prediction. Five underground mines encountering these faults were visited and mapped for structural information. This information, along with surface mapping, indicated that Pistol Gap and Keen Mountain Faults show right-lateral, strike-slip faulting and bedding planes slippage, which can be projected linearly and vertically. These fault zones are up to 200 ft wide, with coalbed offsets up to 18 ft vertically, coalbed swags (depressions) up to 15 ft, and roof falls up to 20 ft high. Recognition criteria include bedding plane slips, coalbed offsets, fault gouge, coalbed swag (depressions or synclines), and disturbed bedding. These recognition criteria will help an informed operator realize that many sudden coalbed discontinuities are related to larger geologic events (in this case thrust faulting) and can be projected linearly and vertically. Ground control strategies include mine designs that minimize fault exposure. Mining plans can be adjusted based on type and extent of fault movement...|$|E

Fundamental interest is directed to detect shallow objectives (not bigger than 1500 m. of depth), related with the ophiolitic sequence. These objectives are characterized to present big hydrocarbon debits, shadow deep, quality trapped hydrocarbon, plus current oil prices in the market, make those significantly profitable. A Landsat image Thematic Mapper middle infrared (band 7), near infrared (band 4) and green red visible (band 2) was used to make different procedures. The first procedure corresponded to the directional filter and borders to define tectonic lineament and for define lithologic differences using no supervised classification process. The seconds procedure was included the Digital Model Terrain (DMT). Were applied decorrelation, stretching, speckle filters and no supervised (ISODATA) classification algorithms too. The analyses were demonstrated that recent tectogenisis and tectolineaments defined enhanced potential reservoirs and oil migration. Pages: 1797 - 180...|$|R
40|$|Synmetamorphic granites {{reflecting}} {{a collapse of}} collisional systems are investi-gated in detail in the Pamirs-Himalayas, where their formation is connected with the Indo-Euroasian collision. Both in the Himalayas and in the Pamirs the Cenozoic granites-leucogranites compose numerous dikes, sills and injection veins, which are connected with decollement planes (thrusts, <b>overthrust</b> <b>sheets),</b> reflecting shear viscous and brittle-plastic flow of rock masses [Vladimirov et al, 1996; Rozen, Fedorovsky, 2001]. It is es-tablished that they are of crust origin, and their isotope characteristics testify the melting of metasedimentary units of lower and middle levels of the crust. All researchers pay at-tention to specific features of these granites, characterized, on the one hand, by anchieu-tectic composition and, on the other hand, by strong variations in K 2 O/Na 2 O (2 - 6), Rb/Sr (0. 3 - 13) ratios, anomalous range of contents of Ba (70 - 2300 ppm), Sr (50 - 900 ppm), and some other key elements. These features do not fit in a model of anatectic melting. The purpose of this work is to consider diagnostic features, thermal sources and models of melting of synmetamorphic stress-granites composing deep-seated levels of collisional systems of the Early Caledonides in Central Asia (the Pre-Olkhon area, th...|$|R
40|$|The Araçuai belt is the orogenic {{belt that}} {{directly}} borders the eastern {{margin of the}} São Francisco Craton in eastern Brazil. Detailed structural investigations in the Governador Valadares region of Minas Gerais indicate that the amphibolite-to granulite-grade internal zones of the Araçuai belt contain several major, west-vergent, crystalline <b>overthrust</b> <b>sheets.</b> These thrust sheets contain approximately homoclinal east-dipping gneissic banding and are separated from one another by zones of isoclinally and sheath-folded, ductiley sheared, metasedimentary units that behaved as mechanically weak glide horizons during deformation. We interpret this regionally imbricated sequence of basement and cover to be the mid-crustal level manifestation of closure of a mid-Neoproterozoic rift basin that existed {{to the east of}} the São Francisco Craton. The major thrusts, which are all cratonvergent, are of Brasiliano/Pan-African age (650 - 450 Ma) becuase they cut the Neoproterozoic Galiléia batholith. Older fabrics are locally preserved in the basement slices, and these fabrics may be relicts of the Transamazonian orogeny (2. 0 Ga). Discrete zones of ductile-brittle extension that were identified in several localities in the study area suggest the occurrence of postorogenic collapse following Brasiliano overthrusting. Alternations of rigid crystalline thrust sheets and highly deformed metasedimentary sequences, such as those of the Governador Valadares region, may be a common structural geometry at a depth of 15 – 20 km in modern regions of collision and basin closure...|$|R
40|$|A vitrophyric clinoenstatite-bearing lava {{associated}} with tholeiitic basalts {{has been found}} lying immediately below an <b>overthrust</b> peridotite <b>sheet</b> near N 6 poui, {{on the west coast}} of New Caledonia. The lava consists mainly of clinoenstatite phenocrysts (29 Vo), sometimes enclosing euhedral chromite, a lesser amount of microphenocryst bronzite (20 Vo) and a glassy mesostasis. Clinoenstatite phenocrysts are compositionally homogeneous (EnseFsle sWoo s) with polysynthetic twins on (100), a feature which is believed to indicate inversion from protoenstatite. Bronzite is variable in composition with EnTa 4 aFsya- 22 Wor. s-o. Hypersthene (Ena 3 - 61 Fs 36 - 5 zWor-+), calcic and subcalcic augite and iron-rich hornblende occur as overgrowths on phenocrysts and as quench microlites. The New Caledonian clinoenstatite boninite is similar chemically, mineralogically, texturally and in terms of age (Eocene-Oligocene) and tectonic setting (with ophiolite complexes) to the three other known clinoenstatite boninite localities (Cape Vogel, Papua New Guinea, Bonin Islands and Mariana Trench). Clinoenstatite boninite magmas are believed to result from extensive partial melting of depleted mantle peridotite under hydrous conditions and an abnormally high geothermal gradient&apos...|$|R
40|$|The French Subalpine Chains {{of southeastern}} France {{lie on the}} western edge of the Western Alps. The area is the {{foreland}} fold/thrust belt to the main orogenic hinterland to the east. The Mesozoic and Cenozoic geological history of the area is typical of many foreland regions, with a former gently subsiding passive margin altered to a destructive margin through compressional tectonics and ocean closure. This thesis details the results of a case study into particular aspects of the sedimentology and basin history of the Subalpine Chains fold/thrust belt. The two main aspects to this thesis are burial diagenesis and the causes of palaeo-temperature variation within the fold/thrust belt. A principal aim of this research was to document the burial diagenetic history of the mid-Cretaceous rudist-bearing 'Urgonian' limestone. Similar Cretaceous rudist platform limestones elsewhere in the world are good reservoir rocks. Often their good porosity is due to the selective dissolution associated with the bi-mineralic rudist shells. Although later cement precipitation often has modified this. Regional dolomitization of platform carbonates has also been known for a long time to increase the reservoir potential of such sediments. In the Urgonian, fabric selective secondary porosity, equant burial cements and dolomitization are important components of the platform's diagenetic history. The petrography and geochemistry of rudist shells, the equant calcite cements responsible for occluding the majority of porosity and replacive dolomitization within the basal section of the Urgonian platform are described. On the basis of the field, petrographic and geochemical data, a diagenetic model for the Urgonian is proposed. The second principal aim was to study the regional variations in maximum burial temperatures and depths. To this end several palaeo-thermal indices were studied (clay minerals, vitrinite reflectance and spore fluorescence) and the thermal history of the region is modelled using a PC-based modelling package (Basinmod). Regional trends in thermal indices are presented and quite clearly indicate an along strike (of the foreland fold/thrust belt) variation in burial temperatures, with a less important across strike trend. A simple thermal history model is used to estimate the maximum depths of burial of specific locations and the results compared to measured values of maturity. Both the modelling and field relationships suggest that major <b>overthrust</b> <b>sheets</b> emplaced only in the northern part of the study area are the principal cause of the greater depth of burial of that part of the Subalpine Chains. The causes of thermal perturbations in fold/thrust belts are discussed. A final third part of this thesis details the results of a pilot study of the geochemistry of syn-tectonic veins. The petrography and outcrop nature of these veins indicate that cyclic hydraulic fracturing (the so-called "crack-seal mechanism") was very important in producing fractures within the rocks during Alpine deformation. These were healed by calcite cements, the stable isotope composition of which indicates the significance of water/wall rock interaction and the temperature of the precipitating fluids on the isotopic composition of the precipitate. Taken as a whole the geochemistry strongly suggests that syn-tectonic fluid flow was highly channelised...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A well-exposed 2 km section {{through the}} Eastern Subbetic, {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} the Crevillente wrench fault zone can be divided into an upper thrust sheet of Triassic rocks, a middle thrust sheet of Cenomanian-Turonian basinal sediments, and a lower thrust sheet of Jurassic limestones unconformably overlain by Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene sediments. Structural relation-ships suggest that the middle <b>sheet</b> <b>overthrust</b> the lower sheet; and both units were subsequently folded and imbricated. This sequence was then overthrust by the upper sheet, incorporating a footwall duplex of Cenomanian-Turonian sediments. These structures can be related to the complex deforma-tion associated with a single overthrusting event. The dominant thrust transport direction is to the east, strongly oblique to the overall trend of the orogen. However, a palaeomagnetic study isolates stable components which indicate no cumulative vertical axis rotation of the thrust sheets. The section is cut by strike-slip faults whose displacements appear to be relatively minor. The Triassic rocks of the upper thrust sheet form a highly disrupted thrust sheet extending over much of the Subbetic, rather than being local to the Crevillente fault zone. This section through the Subbetic can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} major east-directed thrust of basinal sediments of the Median Subbetic over marginal shelf facies of the Internal Subbetic, strongly oblique to the general ESE trend of the orogen. The shortened sequence is cut by a later set of strike slip faults which are probably related to movement on the Crevillente fault. The Betic Cordillera of Southern Spain are an example of an orogen resulting from highly oblique convergence, showing evidence for both compressional (e. g. Egeler &...|$|R
40|$|The present {{publication}} {{deals with}} the geology of the area known as the Ida ou Zal, situated principally in the Palaeozoic of the Western High Atlas mountains in Morocco. The area extends grosso modo between Argana (N), Sidi Idir (E), Menizla (S) and Tirkou (W); its centre lies at 34 ° 10 N— 12 ° 65 W. The stratigraphical sequence covers formations from — as we assume — the Infracambrian (loc. Adoudounien) {{up to and including}} the Trias. In the so-called Caledonian geosyncline, extending in a roughly E—W direction along the northern edge of the African shield, series of Older Palaeozoic sediments of some 10 km thickness were deposited starting with the Basal-formation (?) of the Adoudounian (?) and reaching up to and including the Upper-Ordovician (Caradoc?). In the Adoudounian it came to a vehement volcanism with lava extrusions probably of a basaltic or andesitic composition. The Georgian s. s. consists of marbles and limy shales, for the greater part presenting the appearance of what the French call „calcaires scoriacés”. As to the origin of this extraordinary type of rock the present author puts forward a tectonic explanation. A volcanic activity with submarine extrusions of spilitic lavas took place {{at the end of the}} Georgian, probably continuing into the beginning of the Acadian. The Lower Acadian is characterised by re-sedimented tuffs, showing graded beddings. The Sardic tectonic phase reveals itself by at least a disconformity that includes the Potsdamian; a slight angular unconformity between the Ordovician and the Acadian seems probable. Gothlandian (Wenlock-Ludlow) and Devonian (Siegenian) only occur in <b>overthrust</b> <b>sheets.</b> The autochthonous was folded by a Hercynian phase; the tectonic elements are directed N—S in the Western part of the area, curving to neary NE—SW in the East. The author presumes that this folding is related directly to that of the Anti Atlas, where it is attributed to the Second Erzgebirge folding-phase. The palaeozoic of the Western High Atlas may probably be considered as the Northern flank of a wide anticlinorium, the Southern offshoots of the Anti Atlas forming the Southward dipping flank; the Precambrian outcrops in the core. The curving of the tectonic elements in the Western High Atlas and in the Western Anti Atlas is analogous. A hypothesis is set forward that explains the curving through an adaptation of the tectonical elements — whilst folding — to the NW corner of the African shield. Overthrusts developed, probably as a result of later Hercynian tectonic movements, i. c. one of the Asturian phases. A large overthrust can be followed in the field from the extreme SE of the area to its Western part. As far as could be observed the overthrust is mainly composed of Georgian and Acadian p. p. the sandy formation, presumably Acadian, in the present publication known as “Acadien gréseux probable”. Overthrusted Gothlandian and Devonian appear in the Western part of the area, partly between, partly in front of the principal mass of the overthrust. The writer supposes that the root of the overthrust will lie somewhere to the south east. A subsiding basin was formed during the greater part of the Stephanian and the beginning of the Autunian, in which lacustrine sediments — first red, later greenish — were deposited, covering a pre-existing relief. The total thickness amounts to at least 1500 m, the formation bears all characteristics of a post-orogenetic suite. It is taken that the lake can be considered as an Intramontane trough (Umbgrove); the longitudinal extension was parallel to the direction of the structural elements of the basement i. e. N—S. It is assumed that the whole width of the area was part of the basin. The area was lifted and slightly folded in about E—W direction by the Post-Autunien tectonic phase (Saalian phase). The „Agadir ou Anzizen fault” originated during or after the folding; the author assumes that at this stage other E—W faults came into being as well. In the case of the Agadir ou Anzizen fault, the southern block subsided with respect to the northern block. In the area all of the Stephano-Autunien sediments N of the fault were eroded. There the Trias covers directly the pre-Stephanian Palaeozoic, while on the other side the Trias overlies Stephano-Autunien, from which it is separated by an angular unconformity. The Trias has a typical molasse fades; it is completely composed of red sediments, attaining a thickness of about 2400 m, not counting the conglomerats at its base. The source of the sedimentary material probably must be sought in the southeast. According to the writers conception the first Triassic deposits were deltaic in a lake, covering a pre-existing relief. After the lake had been filled-up, a sandy and marly sedimentation developed, partly in lagoonal environment. The Triassic sedimentary sequence ended with the deposition of red clays that were overlain by basaltic lavas. The dioritic volcanic vent near Zarhenrhin has probably been one of the feeders of the extrusions. The dioritic dyke system too, is probably connected with the Late-Triassic volcanic period. Perhaps there exists a relation between the iron mineralisation near Agadir ou Anzizen and the occurrence of the dioritic dykes. The Alpine orogeny slightly folded the Triassic with an E—W direction. Principally however the Alpine tectonics revealed itself in faulting: all of the E—W faults show an Alpine shift, possibly a rejuvenation of a late-Hercynian fault system. An erosion-plane was formed during a period of quiet, on grounds of analogy supposedly the “Surface préhammadienne”. An erosion plane on a lower level may probably be taken for the “Surface villafranchienne”. Between these two the configuration of the topography permits to distinguish some relics of intermediate levels, indicating the action of tectonic pulsations. Terraces were formed as a consequence of climatical changes during the Pleistocene...|$|R
