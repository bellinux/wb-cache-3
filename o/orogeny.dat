5|$|The Algoman <b>orogeny</b> {{occurred}} 2800 to , and {{it marks}} {{the end of}} the crust-building Archean Eon. There were several episodes of continental collision, compression and subduction which resulted in mountain building during this time. Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, granitic extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman <b>orogeny</b> added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Permian (299–252 {{million years}} ago) and Triassic periods, the Variscan <b>orogeny</b> {{resulted}} in the formation of several mountainous areas including Dartmoor in the south, Exmoor and the Quantocks, and the Mendips.|$|E
50|$|Large modern <b>orogenies</b> often lie on {{the margins}} of present-day continents; the Alleghenian (Appalachian), Laramide, and Andean <b>orogenies</b> exemplify this in the Americas. Older {{inactive}} <b>orogenies,</b> such as the Algoman, Penokean and Antler, are represented by deformed rocks and sedimentary basins further inland.|$|R

5|$|Early in the Acadian <b>orogeny,</b> as the Acadian Mountains {{were rising}} up, {{the black and}} gray shales of the Hamilton Group began accumulating as erosion of the {{mountains}} deposited terrigenous sediments from the land into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally {{as part of a}} zone of repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the Ordovician period with the Taconic <b>orogeny</b> and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian <b>orogeny.</b> The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|The three subprovinces are {{separated}} by steeply dipping shear zones caused by continued compression {{that occurred during the}} Algoman <b>orogeny.</b> These boundaries are major fault zones.|$|E

5000|$|... {{argued that}} most cratons that were around at 2.5 Ga most likely formed {{in a single}} region simply because they were located in a single region in Pangaea, which is the reason Rogers argued for the {{existence}} of Artica.The core of Artica was the Canadian Shield, which [...] named Kenorland. They argued that this continent formed around 2.5 Ga then rifted before reassembling along the 1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson and Taltson-Thelon <b>orogenies.</b> These two <b>orogenies</b> are derived from continental crust (not oceanic crust) and were probably intracontinental, leaving Kenorland intact from 2.5 Ga to present. Correlations between <b>orogenies</b> in Canada and Siberia remain more controversial.|$|R
5000|$|The Caledonian plate cycle - Late Cambrian to Late Silurian Athollian and Caledonian <b>Orogenies.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide <b>orogeny.</b> The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the <b>orogeny</b> led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, Vogel State Park and the surrounding area consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville <b>Orogeny</b> nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal.|$|E
5|$|The Highlands and Islands lie to {{the north}} and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely {{comprises}} ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian <b>Orogeny.</b> It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins.|$|E
50|$|The source {{could be}} dry {{granulite}} {{left over from}} the loss of wet magma during <b>orogenies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} is also {{thought to be}} the source rock of petroleum found in Devonian and Silurian formations in the basin. It is hypothesized that the long distance migration of oil from the New Albany Shale into surrounding sandstones was caused by <b>orogenies</b> occurring to the east. These <b>orogenies</b> caused periods of uplift and subsidence that influenced movement of the hydrocarbons in the Illinois Basin.|$|R
40|$|This site {{explains}} the events during the Paleozoic era {{that led up}} to the formation of the Pangaea supercontinent in the Mesozoic era. The existence in the Paleozoic era of the supercontinent Gondwanaland, the continents Laurentia and Baltica, and smaller continental masses are explained as well as the later collisions which created mountains by folding of the Earth's crust, (<b>orogenies)</b> such as the Acadian, Appalachian, Urals, and Laramide <b>orogenies.</b> Educational levels: Undergraduate lower division...|$|R
5|$|The Laramide <b>orogeny</b> {{affected}} all {{of western}} North America {{by helping to}} build the American cordillera. The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the Rocky Mountains were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide <b>orogeny.</b> This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman <b>orogeny.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan <b>orogeny</b> {{is seen in the}} sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{mountain}} building periods {{were involved in}} the formation of the Central Pangean Mountains, including the Acadian, Caledonian, Alleghenian and Mauritanide <b>orogenies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tectonic {{processes}} such as <b>orogenies</b> cause land to be elevated, and erosional or weathering processes cause land to be worn away {{to lower}} elevations.|$|R
50|$|The {{resultant}} compressional forces produce mountain ranges. The Himalayas, the Alps, and the Appalachians {{are prominent}} examples of compressional <b>orogenies</b> with numerous overthrust faults.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} bedrock includes very ancient Archean gneiss, metamorphic beds {{interspersed with}} granite intrusions created during the Caledonian mountain building period (the Caledonian <b>orogeny),</b> commercially important coal, oil and iron bearing carboniferous deposits and {{the remains of}} substantial Paleogene volcanoes. During their formation, tectonic movements created climatic conditions ranging from polar to desert to tropical and a resultant diversity of fossil remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{raised beach}} of wave-cut {{platforms}} {{has been created}} by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the Quaternary period. The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, including the Black Rock Limestone, illustrates the events of 350 million years ago. The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan <b>orogeny.</b>|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide <b>orogeny</b> and the {{creation}} of the Basin and Range province worked together to steepen the gradient of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau. These streams cut deep, eastward-growing, channels into {{the western edge of the}} Colorado Plateau and deposited their sediment in the widening Basin and Range region.|$|E

50|$|The {{region is}} largely {{underlain}} with shallowly west-dipping strata, but a significant uplifted block {{is found in}} the subsurface immediately north of Wichita Falls. This block, locally known as the Red River uplift, may be part of an uplifted system that extends eastward, joining the Muenster Arch. The uplifts offset Pennsylvanian and older strata in the subsurface and are thought to be contemporaneous with the Ouachita and Ancestral Rocky <b>Orogenies.</b> These Pennsylvanian <b>orogenies</b> resulted from the closure of the Iapetus ocean as the Gondwana and Laurentia continents collided to form Pangea.|$|R
5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian <b>orogeny.</b> This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide <b>orogeny</b> {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman <b>orogeny</b> added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E
5000|$|The Iapetus Ocean was {{an ocean}} {{that existed in}} the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic eras of the {{geologic}} timescale (between 600 and 400 million years ago). The Iapetus Ocean was situated in the southern hemisphere, between the paleocontinents of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia. The ocean disappeared with the Acadian, Caledonian and Taconic <b>orogenies,</b> when these three continents joined to form one big landmass called Euramerica. The [...] "southern" [...] Iapetus Ocean has been proposed to have closed with the Famatinian and Taconic <b>orogenies,</b> meaning a collision between Western Gondwana and Laurentia.|$|R
