40|$|A {{wind turbine}} blade {{generally}} has complex structures including {{several layers of}} composite materials with shear webs, making its structure design very challenging. In this paper, a structural <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> for wind turbine composite blades has been developed based on a parametric FEA (finite element analysis) model and a GA (genetic algorithm) model. The <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> minimises the mass of composite blades with multi-criteria constraints. The number of unidirectional plies, {{the locations of the}} spar cap and the thicknesses of shear webs are taken as design variables. The <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> takes account of five constraints, i. e. stress constraint, deformation constraint, vibration constraint, buckling constraint, and manufacturing manoeuvrability and continuity of laminate layups constraint. The model has been applied to the blade structural optimisation of ELECTRA 30 kW wind turbine, which is a novel VAWT (vertical-axis wind turbine) combining sails and V-shape arm. The mass of the optimised blade is 228 kg, which is 17. 4 % lower than the initial design, indicating the blade mass can be significantly reduced by using the present <b>optimisation</b> <b>model.</b> It is demonstrated that the structural <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> presented in this paper is capable of effectively and accurately determining the optimal structural layups of composite blades...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor to consider when attempting to reconcile mathematical optimisation modelling with the physical reality of water-resource systems. In particular, when the greater part of water resources in supply systems comes from artificial reservoirs, as in Mediterranean regions, a simplified approach based on the attribution of the trophic state of reservoirs can be developed to consider water quality in the <b>optimisation</b> <b>model.</b> Experimental studies have demonstrated that a measure of the trophic state can be given by the Trophic-State Index (TSI), which is evaluated by chlorophyll-a concentration. When certain families of microscopic phytoplanktonic algae produce algal toxins during eutrophication, limitations on resource use based solely on TSI values may be insufficient. In this paper, a linear <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> is presented that includes quality indexes estimated based on both TSI and concentration density of the most toxic species of algae in reservoirs.

40|$|Matrix {{game theory}} and <b>optimisation</b> <b>models</b> offer two radically {{different}} {{perspectives on the}} outcome of evolution. <b>Optimisation</b> <b>models</b> consider frequency-independent selection and envisage evolution as a hill-climbing process on a constant fitness landscape, with the optimal strategy corresponding to the fitness maximum. By contrast, in evolutionary matrix games selection is frequency-dependent and leads to fitness equality among alternative strategies once an evolutionarily stable strategy has been established. In this review we demonstrate that both <b>optimisation</b> <b>models</b> and matrix games represent limiting cases of the general framework of nonlinear frequency-dependent selection. Adaptive dynamics theory considers arbitrary nonlinear frequency and density dependence and envisages evolution as proceeding on an adaptive landscape that changes its shape according to which strategies are present in the population. In adaptive dynamics, evolutionarily stable strategies correspond to conditional fitness maxima: the ESS is characterised {{by the fact that it}} has the highest fitness if it is the established strategy. In this framework it can also be shown that dynamical attainability, evolutionary stability, and invading potential of strategies are pairwise independent properties. In <b>optimisation</b> <b>models,</b> on the other hand, these properties become linked such that the optimal strategy is always attracting, evolutionarily stable and can invade any other strategy. In matrix games fitness is a linear function of the potentially invading strategy and can thus never exhibit an interior maximum: Instead, the fitness landscape is a plane that becomes horizontal once the ESS is established.

40|$|Optimisation {{of product}} family design has been {{emphasised}} and studied for many years. However, previous studies only took overall cost or profit as an optimisation objective, but ignored the supply {{risk of a}} product family. Moreover, the discount associated with the bidding price, which is common in practice, was not considered in the modelling. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective optimisation approach integrating supplier selection into product family design. In our <b>optimisation</b> <b>model,</b> not only the profit but also the supply risk of a product family is formulated as optimisation objectives. Consequently, we can evaluate and optimise a product family from many perspectives. In addition, as a bidding price discount may affect product family’s configuration and supplier selection, we include linear piecewise discount of bidding prices from suppliers in our <b>optimisation</b> <b>model.</b> The NSGA-II algorithm is developed to achieve Pareto non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective <b>optimisation</b> <b>model.</b> Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters is performed, and several managerial insights for enterprises are achieved in the case study of a printing calculator product.

40|$|The present work aims to {{contribute}} to the process and production planning integration. An architecture of a simultaneous engineering platform is presented. A process planning methodology in two levels, for rotational parts, which includes a cutting parameters <b>optimisation</b> <b>model,</b> as well as a dynamic production scheduling module, based on heuristic algorithms, were developed. The proposed approach allows the generation of more reliable process plans, considering simultaneously the shop floor dynamics and the optimal cutting parameters based on the machining cost criteria. The <b>optimisation</b> <b>model</b> considers the technology-related constraints for every elementary operations, and a shop-floor constraint determined by the available time at each workstation. The later, being a constraint related to the part-machining time, is associated with the set of all elementary machining operations and implies the development of a multi-operation <b>optimisation</b> <b>model.</b> In this approach, part-machining time is a new variable for shop-floor scheduling. Being limited by shop-floor status and behaviour -available time at very shedulling date, it can range from the time for minimum cost to the time for maximum production rate.

The computational complexity of the optimisation scales only with the number of input-output pairs and it is independent from the dimensions of both spaces. Furthermore its overall complexity is equal to binary classification. Our approach can be easily be extended towards other structural learning problems with the same optimisation framework.
