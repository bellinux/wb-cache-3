40|$|The Rotor (ROT) is a cycle crank {{configuration}} {{that allows}} the pedals to move independently {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the “dead spots”, where torque output is minimal. Delta efficiency {{has been found to be}} significantly improved during an incremental test when using ROT in a group of untrained cyclists (Santalla et al., 2002 : Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 34, 1854 - 1858). However, no study has investigated whether ROT affects cycling performance directly. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ROT on time-trial cycling performance. Following institutional ethics approval, 12 competitive male cyclists (Age mean 34. 6, s = 7. 1 years, Mass mean 75. 9, s = 7. 8 kg, max mean 4. 5, s = 0. 3 L•min- 1, Wmax mean 363, s = 37. 7 W) provided written informed consent to participate. All subjects completed two 40. 23 -km time-trials on a Kingcycle ergometer in each of two conditions, i) using conventional bicycle cranks (CON) and ii) using the Rotor system (ROT). Cyclists trained for 6 -weeks prior to the experimental trials as either habitual ROT <b>users</b> <b>or</b> habitual <b>CON</b> <b>users.</b> Power output, speed, heart rate,, RER and gross efficiency were measured for the duration of each time-trial. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA (pedalling system used during the test [CON, ROT] x habitual pedalling system [CON, ROT]) was performed to determine if there was a significant condition effect on the following variables: power output, speed, heart rate,, RER and gross efficiency. Statistical significance was set at P 0. 05). Indeed, no effect due to the pedalling system used during tests was found for any of the measured variables (P > 0. 05). Furthermore, there was no interaction effect between the two factors for any of the measured variables (P > 0. 05). However, there were marked differences between conditions for some individuals. For example, power output was 11...|$|R
