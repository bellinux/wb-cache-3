5|$|The Mac Pro had one PATA {{port and}} could support two PATA devices in the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> bays. It {{had a total}} of six SATA ports– four were {{connected}} to the system's drive bays, and two were not connected. The extra SATA ports could be put into service through the use of after-market extender cables to connect internal optical drives, or to provide eSATA ports with the use of an eSATA bulkhead connector. However, the two extra SATA ports were unsupported and disabled under Boot Camp.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.|$|E
25|$|The mid-2010 Server {{model was}} {{initially}} the only Mac Mini to entirely remove the <b>optical</b> <b>drive,</b> {{replacing it with}} a second hard drive in its place. However, from the mid-2011 models onwards, all models of Mac Mini had the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> removed.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, Apple Inc. {{released}} their newest iteration of the MacBook Air, {{which had}} the system's restore files contained on a USB hard drive rather than the traditional install CDs, due to the Air not coming with an <b>optical</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Virtual <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> {{are used}} on {{physical}} computers {{to transfer the}} contents of the optical disks onto hard disk drives. Doing so helps in resolving the problem of the short life span of CDs and DVDs and takes advantage of the faster data transfer rate of hard disk <b>drives.</b> However, virtual <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> are also used for software piracy: early computer games used disc existence verification to ensure licensed use, which can be circumvented using virtual <b>optical</b> <b>drives.</b> As a countermeasure, the StarForce copy protection scheme attempts to thwart disc virtualization. Modern video games have migrated to online product activation as part of their distribution process.|$|R

25|$|On October 22, 2009, Apple {{introduced}} a new server version of the Mac Mini along with revisions of the computer. This model has a second hard drive instead of an <b>optical</b> <b>drive.</b> This version is marketed as an affordable server for small businesses and schools.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} other changes in the 2011 revision. They include the {{elimination}} of the Kensington Security Slot, as well as the <b>optical</b> <b>drive.</b> While the fifth USB 2.0 port was also removed, this has given space for a SD card slot to be included {{on the back of the}} machine.|$|E
25|$|The TOSHIBA <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> used in {{the unit}} can read Compact Discs and DVDs in {{addition}} to HD DVDs when connected to a host that supports reading these formats (such as a PC). As the drive communicates via a generic mass storage protocol over USB the drive {{can be used as}} a standard <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> on computers and operating systems that support USB optical drives. The operating system must have a UDF 2.5 driver to read data from HD DVDs. In addition a software player capable of playing HD DVD titles is required for playback of video. The 256MB internal Memory Unit on the drive which is used for storage of HD DVD features is also accessible by manually installing USB Mass Storage drivers. Once installed, this can be formatted for use as a storage device although it will no longer function on an Xbox 360 unless it is reformatted.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> are {{backward}} compatible with their ancestors up to CD, {{although this is}} not required by standards.|$|R
5000|$|On September 7, 2005 Samsung {{confirmed}} {{their next}} generation of <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> will support Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD discs.|$|R

25|$|The Intel-based Mac Mini {{moves away}} from the {{formerly}} used Ultra ATA/100 to the newer Serial ATA interface, which offers a maximum 3Gbit/s transfer rate, however all models of Intel Mac Mini have been limited to 1.5Gbit/s even though the SATA standard supports a transfer of 3Gbit/s. All models continue to use 2.5-inch hard drives as opposed to the 3.5-inch drives used in standard desktops. A server edition of the Mac Mini was introduced in October 2009, which omits the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> in favor of a second hard drive for a total of 1TB of storage. A Combo drive was initially offered as standard, with the SuperDrive being an option, but through the 2010 models, all models that have an <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> contain the SuperDrive as standard. The 2010 standard version of the Mac (without Server) comes with a 300GB or on 2.66GHz 500GB of storage.|$|E
25|$|Installers of some {{operating}} {{systems can be}} stored to a flash drive instead of a CD or DVD, including various Linux distributions, Windows7 and newer versions, and macOS. In particular, Mac OS X 10.7 is distributed only online, through the Mac App Store, or on flash drives; for a MacBook Air with Boot Camp and no external <b>optical</b> <b>drive,</b> a flash drive {{can be used to}} run installation of Windows or Linux.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid {{version of}} the Nintendo GameCube with a {{commercial}} DVD player, called Q, was developed by Panasonic {{as part of the}} deal struck with Nintendo to develop the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> for the original GameCube hardware. Featuring a completely revised case, the Q overcomes the size limitation of the original GameCube's miniDVD tray by adding a commercial DVD-sized tray, among other hardware revisions. Released exclusively to Japan in December 2001, low sales resulted in the Q being discontinued in December 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Mac Mini G4 uses {{a single}} 2.5-inch Ultra ATA/100 hard drive, {{which offers a}} maximum {{transfer}} rate of 100MB/s. Because of its sealed enclosure, {{it is not possible}} to upgrade the hard drive without opening the enclosure and possibly voiding the warranty of the system. The Mac Mini G4 also contains a second ATA cable that connects to the <b>optical</b> <b>drive.</b> A Combo drive was included as standard, while a SuperDrive able to write to DVDs was also an option.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{rootkits}} do not elevate access, {{but rather}} {{are used to}} make another software payload undetectable by adding stealth capabilities. Most rootkits are classified as malware, because the payloads they are bundled with are malicious. For example, a payload might covertly steal user passwords, credit card information, computing resources, or conduct other unauthorized activities. A small number of rootkits may be considered utility applications by their users: for example, a rootkit might cloak a CD-ROM-emulation driver, allowing video game users to defeat anti-piracy measures that require insertion of the original installation media into a physical <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> to verify that the software was legitimately purchased.|$|E
25|$|Another feature gives {{players the}} ability to create Avatars. Players are able to {{customize}} avatars by changing body shape, facial features, hair and clothes, as well as new clothing being released from time to time. Xbox Live requires that users select an avatar. Another feature is {{the ability to}} install an entire game disc onto the Xbox 360's hard drive, which decreases loading times, and significantly reduces noise due to the game being read from the hard drive and not the louder disc drive (similar to the PS2 HD LOADER Feature). For most games this feature also reduces {{the amount of time spent}} reading the disc, thereby helping to extend the life-span of the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism.|$|E
50|$|It {{also allows}} DVDs {{to be played}} over a network, meaning that small media centre PCs without <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> can use the DVD drive on a server.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>drives</b> can be {{slowed down}} by {{software}} to quiet them, such as Nero DriveSpeed, or emulated by virtual drive {{programs such as}} Daemon Tools to eliminate their noise entirely. Notebook <b>optical</b> <b>drives</b> can be used, {{which tend to be}} quieter, however this may be because they tend to run slower (typically 24× CD speed, 8× DVD speed). Some DVD drives have a feature, commonly called Riplock, which reduces drive noise by slowing the drive during video playback. For playback operations only 1x (or real time) speed is required.|$|R

25|$|Image Mastering API (IMAPI v2) enables DVD burning {{support for}} applications, in {{addition}} to CD burning. IMAPI v2 supports multiple optical drives, even recording to multiple drives simultaneously, unlike IMAPI in Windows XP which only supported recording with one <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> at a time. In addition, multiple filesystems are supported. Applications using IMAPI v2 can create, and burn disc images—it is extensible {{in the sense that}} developers can write their own specific media formats and create their own file systems for its programming interfaces. IMAPI v2 is implemented as a DLL rather than as a service {{as was the case in}} Windows XP, and is also scriptable using VBScript. IMAPI v2 is also available for Windows XP. With the Windows Feature Pack for Storage installed, IMAPI 2.0 supports Recordable Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media as well. Windows DVD Maker can burn DVD-Video discs, while Windows Explorer can burn data on DVDs (DVD±R, DVD±R DL, DVD±R RW) {{in addition to}} DVD-RAM and CDs.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Jobs {{cancelled}} {{almost all}} of the product lines, and introduced a new product strategy focusing only on desktop and laptop computers for both consumer and professional customer. With the Power Macintosh G3 filling the role of a desktop computer marketed at professional customers, Apple began to focus on an entry-level desktop computer suitable for consumers. The result was the iMac released in 1998, a computer with an innovative design intended to be friendly and easily accessible for average computer users. For the iMac's development, Rubinstein assembled a team and with a deadline of only 11 months (a timeline they considered impossible). The iMac was an immediate success, not only helping to revitalise Apple as a company, but also popularising new technologies at the time, such as USB, which would then go on to become an industry standard. The iMac also shipped without a floppy disk drive (rare for computers of the era), relying solely on the <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> and new technologies such as USB and Firewire for data transfer. Rubinstein was responsible for both of these decisions.|$|E
25|$|A {{new model}} of the Mac Mini was {{introduced}} on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a unibody aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an HDMI port and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD <b>optical</b> <b>drive</b> from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers. It got a much anticipated refresh after long two years in October 2014, bringing Haswell CPUs, better graphics, $100 lower price for the base model, while the metal body remained nearly the same. The only change was {{the removal of the}} two holes used to open the case, as the RAM is no longer upgradable because it's now soldered to the logic board; this idea is similar to the Retina MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mid 2014 21.5-inch iMac.|$|E
50|$|For 2013 {{the series}} are now named Envy 17t. Intel Haswell (Lynx Point) {{processors}} are offered with Intel HD 4600 graphics, and optional NVIDIA GT 740M graphics along with Blu-ray <b>optical</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
