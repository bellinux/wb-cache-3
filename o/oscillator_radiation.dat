40|$|Superconducting Flux-Flow Oscillators (FFO) {{as local}} {{oscillators}} for radio astronomy are perfectly suited {{to be combined}} with SIS-mixing-devices in standard Nb/A 1 -AlOxfNb technology, having the potential to result in highly sophisticated integrated receivers up to the terahertz region. Oscillator linewidth and-stability are of exceptional importance for radio astronomical applications. A spectroscopic measurement setup for the 350 GHz-band has been built up to investi gate the radiation properties of superconducting oscillators. We report on unique time resolved measurements of Flux-Flow <b>Oscillator</b> <b>radiation</b> characteristics usin g a modified KOSMA Acousto-Optical Spectrometer (AOS).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the radiation process of the charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive medium. In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases: first, the source has not eigenfrequency, and second, the source has eigenfrequency. In the first case, when the Cherenkov radiation occurs, the non-zero eigenfrequency produces a paradox for Doppler effect. It is shown that the absence of the eigenfrequency solves the paradox known in the literature. The question whether the process is normal (i. e. hard photons are being radiated under the small angles) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium dispersion. When the source has an eigenfrequency the Doppler effects can be either normal or anomalous. In the X-ray range of the <b>oscillator</b> <b>radiation</b> spectrum we have two photons radiated under the same angle- soft and hard. In this case the radiation obeys to so-called complicated Doppler effect, i. e. in the soft photon region we have anomalous Doppler effect and in the hard photon region we have normal Doppler effect.

The mixer {{is based on the}} nonlinear miniband transport giving rise to domains excited under the action of a microwave field. We designed the mixer for broadband operation (300 – 600 GHz). For studying basic properties, we investigated the mixer as a harmonic mixer in 15 th order to detect radiation at a radio frequency (RF) near 300 GHz using local <b>oscillator</b> (LO) <b>radiation</b> of a frequency near 20 GHz. We reached a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 10 fW/Hz.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} high intensity, pulsed, optically pumped, far-infrared (FIR) lasers. The work was motivated by {{the need for a}} radiation source for the measurement of the ion temperature in magnetically confined, high temperature plasmas (e. g. tokamak plasmas), using Thomson scattering. Constraints imposed by the plasma parameters, the scattering geometry and available detector sensitivities lead to the requirement of a radiation source wavelength between 30 andnbsp;andmu;m and 1 andnbsp;mm and a source power and#x 2273;andnbsp; 1 MW in a bandwidth and#x 2272;andnbsp; 60 andnbsp;MHz. Results are presented for a 496 andnbsp;andmu;m, 500 andnbsp;watt, methyl fluoride (CH 3 F) cavity laser, with a bandwidth of andlt;andnbsp; 30 andnbsp;MHz, which was optically pumped by a 9. 55 andnbsp;andmu;m CO 2 laser. Results are also presented for an optically excited mirrorless, super-radiant, CH 3 F laser, which generated over 0. 6 andnbsp;MW of FIR radiation within a bandwidth of about 300 andnbsp;MHz. The performance of this laser has also been simulated by a computer model, which allows the optimum operating parameters to be predicted. An assembly constructed on the principle of the injection laser, in which low power narrow-band <b>oscillator</b> <b>radiation</b> is used to control the output of a super-radiant system, has been used to generate 250 kW of 496 andmu;m radiation, with a bandwidth of andlt;andnbsp; 60 andnbsp;MHz. Investigations of the FIR output from heavy water vapour (D 2 O) in a super-radiant laser assembly, optically excited by several different CO 2 laser wavelengths, have resulted in the generation of 60 andnbsp;ns (FWHM) pulses of FIR radiation with average powers of 1. 3, 9. 2 and 15. 8 andnbsp;MW, at wavelengths of 385, 119 and 66 andnbsp;andmu;m, respectively. All these lasers were found to have a higher CO 2 to FIR photon conversion efficiency than the 496 andnbsp;andmu;m CH 3 F laser. In addition, the energy level spacing in D 2 O is such that the molecule can generate narrow bandwidth radiation more readily than the CH 3 F molecule. From this work it is concluded that an injection laser assembly, similar to that used with CH 3 F, but containing D 2 O vapour, optically pumped by a 9. 26 andnbsp;andmu;m CO 2 laser and generating several megawatts of 385 andnbsp;andmu;m radiation, would satisfy the source requirements mentioned above. </p...|$|E

40|$|We further {{develop a}} {{recently}} introduced variational principle of stationary action for problems in nonconservative classical mechanics and extend it to classical field theories. The variational calculus used {{is consistent with}} an initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible processes, such as dissipation, to be included {{at the level of}} the action. In this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a nonconservative action S, which is a functional of a doubled set of degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a potential K which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open system interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out or coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer conserved when K is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a physical system are derived solely from K. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic <b>oscillators,</b> <b>radiation</b> reaction on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational principle. We present the nonconservative action for a Navier-Stokes fluid including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well as an action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can be easily generalized to more realistic rheological models. We show that the nonconservative action can be derived as the classical limit of a more complete quantum theory. Comment: 42 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} frequency locking of a dual, forward reverse emitting third-order distributed feedback quantum cascade laser (QCL) at 3. 5 THz.

We also characterize how the use of a less sensitive pyroelectric detector can influence the quality of frequency locking, illustrating experimentally that the sensitivity of the detectors is crucial.

The NV center is driven by a laser and interacts with the cavity photon field and with the strain field of the mechanical <b>oscillator,</b> while <b>radiation</b> pressure couples mechanical resonator and cavity field. Starting from the full master equation we derive the rate equation for the mechanical resonator's motion, whose coefficients depend on the system parameters and on the noise sources. We then determine the cooling regime, the cooling rate, the asymptotic temperatures, and the spectrum of resonance fluorescence for experimentally relevant parameter regimes. For these parameters, we consider an electronic transition, whose linewidth allows one to perform sideband cooling, and show that the addition of an optical cavity in general does not improve the cooling efficiency. We further show that pure dephasing of the NV center's electronic transitions can lead to an improvement of the cooling efficiency. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures. To appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
