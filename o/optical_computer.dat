Place both photographs on a light table to make them transparent, and slide one across the other until their images line up.

5000|$|The {{first modern}} <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> mice were the Microsoft IntelliMouse with IntelliEye and IntelliMouse Explorer, {{introduced}} in 1999 using technology developed by Hewlett-Packard. [...] It worked on almost any surface, and represented a welcome improvement over mechanical mice, which {{would pick up}} dirt, track capriciously, invite rough handling, {{and need to be}} taken apart and cleaned frequently. Other manufacturers soon followed Microsoft’s lead using components manufactured by the HP spin-off Agilent Technologies, and {{over the next several years}} mechanical mice became obsolete.The technology underlying the modern <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> mouse is known as digital image correlation, a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets. A simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 Lyon optical mouse. Optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood, cloth, mouse pads and Formica. These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved.|$|E

50|$|One {{promising}} {{option is}} to eliminate the front side bus. Modern vertical laser diodes enable this change. In theory, an <b>optical</b> <b>computer's</b> components could directly connect through a holographic or phased open-air switching system.

Since a computer's connectors are also its most likely failure points, a busless system may be more reliable.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge to}} optical computing is that computation is a nonlinear {{process in which}} multiple signals must interact. Light, which is an electromagnetic wave, can only interact with another electromagnetic wave {{in the presence of}} electrons in a material, and the strength of this interaction is much weaker for electromagnetic waves, such as light, than for the electronic signals in a conventional computer. This may result in the processing elements for an <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> requiring more power and larger dimensions than those for a conventional electronic computer using transistors.|$|E
50|$|While the {{reconstruction}} of the image in the document scanning application (Allen et al.) required resolution by the optical navigators on the order of 1/600th of an inch, implementation of optical position measurement in computer mice not only benefit from the cost reductions inherent in navigating at lower resolution, but also enjoy the advantage of visual feedback to the user of the cursor position on the computer display. In 2002, Gary Gordon, Derek Knee, Rajeev Badyal and Jason Hartlove were awarded US Patent 6,433,780 for an <b>optical</b> <b>computer</b> mouse that measured position using image correlation.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of mass-produced binary {{components}} for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. However, Donald Knuth argues that ternary logic's elegance and efficiency will bring them back into development in the future.

A ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and −1.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{concerns}} the computational complexity {{of a model}} of computation that is inspired by <b>optical</b> <b>computers.</b> The model is called the continuous space machine and operates in discrete timesteps {{over a number of}} two-dimensional images of fixed size and arbitrary spatial resolution. The (constant time) operations on images include Fourier transformation, multiplication, addition, thresholding, copying and scaling. We survey some of the work to date on the continuous space machine. This includes a characterisation of the power of an important discrete restriction of the model. Parallel time corresponds, within a polynomial, to sequential space on Turing machines, thus satisfying the parallel computation thesis. A characterisation of the complexity class NC in terms of the model is also given. Thus the model has computational power that is (polynomially) equivalent to that of many well-known parallel models. Such characterisations give a method to translate parallel algorithms to optical algorithms and facilitate the application of the complexity theory toolbox to <b>optical</b> <b>computers.</b> In the present work we improve on these results. Specifically we tighten a lower bound and present some new resource trade-offs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Multivariate Optical Computing is an {{approach}} {{to the development of}} spectroscopic instruments, particularly for industrial applications such as process analytical support.

50|$|While each {{chemical}} problem presents its {{own unique}} challenges and opportunities, {{the design of a}} system for a specific analysis is complex and requires the assembly of several pieces of a spectroscopic puzzle.
