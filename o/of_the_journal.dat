40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine <b>the</b> scholarly impact <b>of</b> health and medical journals in Africa. A descriptive informetric research approach was used to analyse 134 health and medical <b>journals</b> hosted in <b>the</b> African <b>Journal</b> Online (AJOL) database. Harzing’s Publish or Perish (PoP) software was used to extract publication and citation indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals.</b> These indicators include number of citations, number of paper publications, cites per year, cites per paper, and <b>the</b> h-index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals.</b> <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals</b> was equally examined in other major databases like Thomson Reuters and Scopus. Findings reveal that only 20 African countries contributed health and medical <b>journals</b> to <b>the</b> AJOL database with Nigeria and South Africa producing nearly 70 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals.</b> A rank list of 29 journals was developed with South African Medical Journal and African Health Sciences ranking highest in the list respectively. Only 14 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals</b> were found in Thompson Reuters while Scopus indexes only 38. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journals.</b> These findings challenge the criteria Thompson Reuters and Scopus use in <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>journals</b> for their databases.

5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic reputation was confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied him since the days of his curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Journal</b> of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E

5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals that accounted {{for most of the}} editorial duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought {{that he would be}} too busy to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal.</b> Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was seldom}} {{mentioned}} during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, {{particularly in the}} US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus {{began to appear in}} these newspapers, including Karys, Vienas iš daugelio (1950), Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas (1955), and Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje (1956). The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> Švytūrys.
