40|$|Pulsed jet {{actuators}} (PJAs) {{are one of}} {{the candidate}} technologies to be integrated in Fowler flaps to increase the maximum lift coefficient of transport aircraft in the landing configuration. The total system consists of the actuators plus sensors, a piping system to supply pressurized air and a (redundant) power and communication system to provide actuator control. In this paper, it is investigated what increase in the maximum lift coefficient is required to justify the added weight and power <b>off-takes</b> that accompany the integration of pulsed jet actuators. This is done by making an automated design process for the overall aircraft, the piping assembly system, and the electrical wiring interconnection system. These last two sub-systems rely on KBE techniques that automate dimensioning and performance evaluation. A test case is specified that encompasses the design of a typical single-aisle mid-range aircraft with and without the PJA system installed. It is concluded that the introduction of the PJA system requires at least an increase in maximum lift coefficient of 0. 2 to justify the increase in system mass and power <b>off-takes.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that if the maximum lift coefficient increases with 0. 4, only small reductions in maximum take-off weight (− 0. 3 %) and operating empty weight (− 0. 6 %) can be expected, while the total fuel burn remains virtually constant.

40|$|The trophy {{hunting of}} lions Panthera leo is {{contentious}} due to uncertainty concerning conservation impacts {{and because of}} highly polarised opinions about the practice. African lions are hunted across at least ~ 558, 000 km(2), which comprises 27 - 32 % of the lion range in countries where trophy hunting of the species is permitted. Consequently, trophy hunting has potential to impart significant positive or negative impacts on lions. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} excessive trophy harvests have driven lion population declines. There have been several attempts by protectionist non-governmental organisations to reduce or preclude trophy hunting via restrictions on the import and export of lion trophies. We document the management of lion hunting in Africa and highlight challenges which need addressing to achieve sustainability. Problems include: unscientific bases for quota setting; excessive quotas and <b>off-takes</b> in some countries; fixed quotas which encourage over-harvest; and lack of restrictions on the age of lions that can be hunted. Key interventions needed to make lion hunting more sustainable, include implementation of: enforced age restrictions; improved trophy monitoring; adaptive management of quotas and a minimum length of lion hunts of at least 21 days. Some range states have made important steps towards implementing such improved management and <b>off-takes</b> have fallen steeply in recent years. For example age restrictions have been introduced in Tanzania and in Niassa in Mozambique, and are being considered for Benin and Zimbabwe, several states have reduced quotas, and Zimbabwe is implementing trophy monitoring.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this thesis, a {{methodology}} for modeling of entire system architectures of commercial transport aircraft is presented. The author's approach facilitates technology assessment of innovative system technology on aircraft-level in conceptual and early preliminary aircraft design. It closes the existing gap of sound systems modeling in early aircraft design synthesis. The proposed methodology uses a strictly function-driven approach for sizing of the single aircraft systems according to the dedicated aircraft-level functions. System weight and maximum as well as mission dependent power <b>off-takes</b> are estimated. The principle of energy balance is used to derive the power demand of the single systems. A modular and flexible approach has been chosen that allows for fast variation of the system architecture. Thus, investigation of large design spaces is possible. For integration and assessment of innovative systems technology, a probabilistic framework is introduced that incorporates remaining uncertainties. The proposed system model has been integrated into the Institute's of Aeronautics and Astronautics (ILR) Multidisciplinary Integrated Conceptual Aircraft Design and Optimization (MICADO) environment. Thus, repercussions of system integration, e. g. on aircraft efficiency or performance, can be captured in a highly integrated environment. The proposed systems model is a valuable tool for sound assessment of innovative system technology on overall aircraft-level already in conceptual aircraft design. The proposed systems model has been validated against two commercial transport aircraft. Additionally, comprehensive sensitivity studies show dependencies and identify the main design drivers of the single systems. Two case studies show the added-value of integration of the proposed systems model into early aircraft design synthesis. The first case study concentrates on evaluation of the impact of engine power <b>off-takes</b> on aircraft performance and efficiency. The second design study focuses on integration of innovative technology into the overall system architecture and on application of the proposed probabilistic framework for considering the remaining uncertainties in design and technology assessment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{maintain}} stability {{within the}} UCTE-grid, European TSOs {{are responsible for}} maintaining a balance between generation, import, consumption and export in their control zones. This responsibility is partly transferred to BRPs which are market participants responsible for the balance between injections and <b>off-takes</b> in their perimeter. With imbalance fees working as incentive to avoid imbalances, BRPs will forecast, schedule and nominate their positions to the TSO before gate closure. With rising interest in electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (RES-e), often characterized by variability, lower predictability and limited controllability, BRPs are facing difficulties meeting their nominated positions in real-time. This gives them a competitive disadvantage.

40|$|The trophy {{hunting of}} lions is {{contentious}} due to increasing evidence of impacts on wild populations, and ethical concerns surrounding the hunting of captive-bred lions in South Africa. The captive-bred lion hunting industry in South Africa has grown rapidly {{while the number}} of wild lions hunted in other African countries has declined. In 2009 and 2010, 833 and 682 lion trophies were exported from South Africa, respectively, more than double the combined export (2009, 471; 2010, 318) from other African countries. There has been an associated increase in the prevalence of the export of lion bones from South Africa: at least 645 bones/sets of bones were exported in 2010, 75. 0 % of which went to Asia. Such trade could be problematic if it stimulated demand for bones from wild lions or other wild felids. Captive-bred lion hunting differs from wild lion hunting in that lions are hunted in smaller areas (49. 9 ± 8. 4 km 2 compared to 843 to 5933 km 2, depending on the country), hunts are cheaper (US$ 20 000 – 40 000 compared to US$ 37 000 – 76 000 [excluding the costs of shooting other species and government charges]), shorter (3. 3 compared to 14 – 21 days), success rates are higher (99. 2 % compared to 51. 0 – 96. 0 %), and trophy quality is higher (skull length + breadth = 638. 8 compared to 614 – 638 cm). Most clients perceive captive-bred and wild lion hunting to be different products but there is some overlap in markets: 48. 7 % of clients that had hunted captive-bred lions showed no preference regarding the type of future hunts. Owing {{to the size of the}} captive-bred hunting industry, even marginal overlap in demand could affect wild lion hunting significantly. If captive-bred lion hunting were ever prohibited, a transfer of demand to wild lion hunts could lead to elevated <b>off-takes</b> with negative impacts on wild populations. However, if <b>off-takes</b> of wild lions were held constant or reduced through effective regulation of quotas, increased demand could increase the price of wild lion hunts and strengthen financial incentives for lion conservation. These possibilities should be considered if future efforts are made to regulate captive-bred lion hunting. Panthera[URL]...|$|R
