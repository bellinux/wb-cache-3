5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was {{designed}} to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship, theoretically offering the ability to scout ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> locate targets for the smaller ships to attack.

5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate.

Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976.

At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them.

According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings.

40|$|An {{important}} {{stage in}} designing of pieces made of composite materials consists <b>of</b> establishing <b>the</b> composite topology {{in such a}} way that it has certain properties needed in exploitation.

The method is applicable to all types of laminate composites, no matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cladding or matrix nature. The direct problem consists in determining <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> composite, minimising <b>the</b> bar mass, for an imposed (given) flexural stiffness, knowing the densities <b>and</b> elasticity modules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> indirect problem consists in determining the maximum stiffness, <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> composite for a given (imposed) mass, knowing the densities <b>and</b> elasticity modules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> presented programmes offer to <b>the</b> producer <b>of</b> this kind <b>of</b> materials <b>the</b> possibility to quickly establish the optimum topology...|$|R

5|$|The {{first episode}} starts with Kills furiously {{walking with a}} {{revolver}} in direction of a blonde man; she later ties him up on a bed, as he screams and tries to resist. Kills calls a friend whose name is not revealed, and asks him for help. During the second episode, Kills assassinates another man and takes his photograph; the next episode, she is arrested by a group—played by Far East Movement—who threaten her. She manages to strangle the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> later leaves a message for her anonymous friend, warning him that her face is being distributed on wanted posters.|$|E

Christina, Queen of Sweden, who had abdicated the Swedish throne and moved to Rome before converting to the Catholic Church, served as the secular supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> became particularly close to Decio Azzolino.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviving}} the Sacred Beasts, the hatred is purged, but the racial tensions remain. Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and his cold attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their way of thinking. At Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become {{a threat to the}} world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its negative emotions. The growing positive emotions of the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E

Monica is often jokingly teased by the others for having been extremely overweight as a child, especially by her brother Ross. Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica’s first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time, until Richard expresses {{that he does not}} want to have children, much to Monica’s dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series.|$|E
