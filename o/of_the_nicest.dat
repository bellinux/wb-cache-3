500|$|Guero, Beck's eighth studio album, was {{recorded}} over {{the span of}} nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound. For example, after recording a [...] "sonically perfect" [...] version of a song at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: [...] "We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio.

500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} his own lead vocal onto the 1971 basic track, {{as he had}} done earlier with [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", for Living in the Material World (1973). On 31 May 1975, further overdubs were carried out on [...] "You", comprising a second drum part, by Jim Keltner; tenor sax solos from Jim Horn; and ambient keyboards, played by David Foster. Harrison said that Horn's saxophone playing on the track was [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> rock-n-roll sounds I've heard in years". The overdubs added to the song's radio-friendly qualities, particularly through the use of ARP String Synthesizer, but Madinger and Easter note that Keltner's drum part, which is higher in the mix than Gordon's and was played in half-time, produces an effect whereby the song's tempo appears to be slower than on the 1971 recording. With a significant amount of post-production work having been carried out in Los Angeles, Spector did not receive a co-producer's credit for [...] "You" [...] as he had for Harrison's version of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some".|$|E

5|$|In {{a revised}} version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate.

The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

Victorian and Test teammate Lawry rated Meckiff [...] "along with Graham McKenzie, Brian Booth, Peter Burge and one or two others as really nature's gentlemen" [...] and said his exit was [...] "one of the saddest [...] of [...] life".

[...] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as [...] "purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, so sharp.... a literary lemon meringue."

IGN's Goldstein described the controls as [...] "relatively simple" [...] and easy to understand within a single game, and Scott Osborne of GameSpy found the controls awkward but easily learned. In comparison, Charles Herold of The New York Times and a friend could not figure out Blitz's rules for 20 minutes, feeling [...] "too macho" [...] to do the tutorial. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Jonathan Silver thought the gameplay was too frenzied, like [...] "NHL Hitz on steroids". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's looseness. She noted the game's [...] "serious attitude" [...] and [...] "very gritty view of sports", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nicest</b> aspects" [...] of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded Deathrows profanity as the [...] "best use of endless cursing in a game... ever". Herold of The New York Times noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the [...] "savage profanities", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games. He added that the game's frantic speed kept him too consumed to curse at the game himself. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Troy Oxford also connected the profanity to the game's [...] "'M' rating".|$|E
