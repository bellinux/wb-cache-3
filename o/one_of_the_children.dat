Gordon toured the Northeast of the United States giving public speeches, {{starting}} as young as 15, including a speech in Boston at age 18. During one such event, she met a Scottish physician named Charles H. Gordon, and married him in 1862.

5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Thrud is sent to Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School, {{where he}} towers above the {{teachers}} and his fellow students. When <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> shoots him with a pea shooter, Thrud's reaction is to kill and maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing {{to return to the}} wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small helmet and a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having {{inherited}} the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer Set, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of maat, the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order and disorder, and the disruption of life by death.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven {{observe a}} vision of the Children of the Forest {{creating}} the Night King by impaling a man with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Children,</b> about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E

5|$|Castelli {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1764. He {{was the first of}} eight {{children}} born to a Venetian doctor, Ángel Castelli Salomón, and Josefa Villarino, who was a relative of Manuel Belgrano. He was trained by the Jesuits shortly before their expulsion, and attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos in Buenos Aires. As was customary, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of the Castelli family was ordained into the priesthood, and Juan José was chosen for this. He was sent to study at the Colegio Monserrat, part of the University of Córdoba. He was influenced by the works of Voltaire and Diderot, and especially by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. He was a fellow student of men who would later have influence in the public life of South America, including Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, Juan José Paso, Manuel Alberti, Pedro Medrano, and Juan Martínez de Rozas, among others. He focused on studying philosophy and theology, but when his father died in 1785, he abandoned his career in the priesthood, for which he felt no strong vocation.|$|E
5|$|Taking part in {{the third}} series of the BBC family-history {{documentary}} series, Who Do You Think You Are?, Lawson sought to uncover some of her family's ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Sephardi ancestry, as she had believed. She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft. His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein (1821-1873), who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon & Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868-1928), the great-grandfather of Nigella Lawson.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E
50|$|However, {{even those}} laws contain a general {{presumption}} against making an adoption order because an adoption order severs the legal relationship between <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> birth parents. Due to <b>the</b> serious consequences <b>of</b> an adoption order, all step-parent adoption laws (including those applying to opposite-sex couples) contain a strong preference {{for dealing with}} new parenting arrangements through a parenting order rather than an adoption order.|$|R

30|$|Risk {{describes}} <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement not becoming fulfilled {{and estimated}} losses if the requirement fails. The losses can be economical, time, and failure-propagation to other requirements. Failure propagation can be presented by composite and derive relationships <b>of</b> requirements. If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> requirements fails, then the parent fails as well. If a derived requirement fails, it directly implies a failure {{in at least}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its source requirements.|$|R

25|$|The {{documentary}} My Amityville Horror {{was released}} in March 2013.

Lutz echos the original story as told by his mother and step-father. He also makes additional claims that both he and George Lutz were possessed, that George Lutz demonstrated telekinetic abilities, and strongly suggests that George's dabbling in the occult may have initiated the demonic events.|$|E

Its failure resulted in the hanging of Agustín de Legaspi and the execution of Magat Salamat (the crown-prince of Tondo). Thereafter, some of the conspirators were exiled to Guam or Guerrero, Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupants}} of this raft initially assumed {{they would be}} rescued quickly, but two weeks went by until even with strict rationing they were running low on food and water. They were eventually sighted by aircraft and some supplies dropped. After nineteen days on the open sea, they were rescued by the destroyer , but not before the rescuers had fired 16 rounds at the raft in the mistaken impression it was a German submarine. After transfer to the Dutch merchant steamship Prins William Van Oranje, the survivors were landed at Barbados. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> Robert Bell, would later write a book, In Peril on the Sea: A Personal Remembrance, about the ordeal.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Sorolla {{began to}} paint {{children}} bathing. In the 1904 painting La hora del baño Sorolla linked fishing and bathing children and portrayed naked children swimming between {{a fishing boat}} and an ox standing in the water. In the foreground <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> comes from the sea and is awaited by {{a young woman who}} stretches out a white cloth to dry the wet child. Already this picture anticipates Sorolla's themes in Walk on the Beach. So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is bathed in the light of early evening.|$|E
25|$|The video {{starts off}} with some grass sinking {{down into the}} dirt, causing it to turn wet. It then cuts to a {{scorpion}} walking to where Linkin Park are performing. It explores the many ironies of humanity and its ill-effects on {{the earth and the}} environment (see above). It juxtaposes various pieces of footage: a large, well-fed man eating fast food, a woman measuring her waist and a man who is so malnourished that his ribcage is visible through his skin; African Americans being hosed down by the Ku Klux Klan; nuclear explosions, the World Trade Center collapsing {{as a result of the}} September 11 attacks, children waving American flags (<b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> being Brad Delson), a Middle Eastern child holding an AK-47, clips of oil tankers torn in half and birds covered in an oil slick.
