India accounts for 13 per cent of commitments in global water aid for 2006–07, receiving an annual average of about 830million (€620million), more than double the amount provided to China. India's biggest water and sanitation donor is Japan, which provided 635million, followed by the World Bank with 130million. The annual average for 2004–06, however, was about half as much at 448million, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Japan</b> provided 293million and the World Bank 87million.

50|$|Kiyozaemon died in 1907, {{creating}} {{the opportunity for}} Yasujirō to break free. In 1909, he mortgaged the family estate for 5000 yen. With this money, he married Nishizawa Koto and had a daughter, Shukuko, in 1909, then attended Waseda University investing in rough land and businesses. At the time, however, rough land had little value and was looked upon as a foolish investment. Still, Yasujirō persisted. In 1917, he purchased 650 acre of land for 30,000 yen from a village near the fashionable mountain resort of Karuizawa, and built several vacation houses and cottages. With this, he established a company, Hakone Resorts Ltd. Japan had prospered greatly during the First World War, initiating a period of prosperity and democracy the likes <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Japan</b> had never experienced before. Yasujirō's wealth and empire expanded proportionally with this boom. Customers came, and by 1923, Hakone Resorts Ltd had a value of 20,000,000 yen.|$|E

40|$|Background: Use of live {{non-human}} primates (NHPs) in {{biomedical research}} is a controversial issue {{in many parts}} of the world. Recent use of NHPs in research in Asian countries was surveyed. Aim: To elucidate the use of NHPs in research in Asian countries. Settings and design: The peer-reviewed literature was sampled according to the species used, area of research, research class and geographic location. Articles derived from database searches were scrutinised. Methods and Material: Studies were identified from the PrimateLit database. Results and Conclusion: Results suggested that NHP research was conducted in 16 countries, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Japan</b> accounted for two-thirds. About 55 &#x 0025; of studies involved use of live animals, whereas the remaining 45 &#x 0025; used some lower level of biological material. More than 70 &#x 0025; of the studies using live NHPs included use of Old World monkeys. M. fuscata (18 &#x 0025;), M. mulatta (17 &#x 0025;) and M. fascicularis (10 &#x 0025;) were the three most commonly used species. The most common research areas were neuroscience (44 &#x 0025;), conservation (14 &#x 0025;) and behaviour (11 &#x 0025;). Due to high demand for NHPs, there is room for increased breeding of NHPs to be used for research in Asian countries...|$|E

The author paid a visit, in the Shizuoka Prefecture, on one of these groups, the members of which represent 90 % of fish-hatcheries and launch on the market 2, 500 to 3, 000 tons per year. In a general way, the hatcheries of this area are situated on 15 degree C springs. Each exploitation yields an average output of 100 tons. The waters are of excellent quality, lightly acid (pH 6. 8), allowing fish loads up to 100 kg/m 2. Trout attain a fair growth; the market size of 130 g is reached one year after first feeding, with survival rates of 80 to 90 %. A breeding test of rainbow-trout in salt water was attempted in 1970 - 1975; the result was an output of a few tons per year only, which has now become practically non existent. The tendency is rather to replace rainbow-trout by coho salmon and introductions have just been practised in a limited way. Total production in Japan should be twice as high during the next ten years. However, the amount of good quality available water, the need to provide trout with food rich in proteins (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Japan</b> is rather poor) set a limit to this purpos...|$|E
