Hillary Clinton’s support with gay Democrat men in New York is stronger than her support among the state’s Democrats overall. Bernie Sanders lead among gay registered Democrats age 18-24, with 73% supporting Bernie Sanders, but this group only comprises 5% <b>of</b> the overall <b>gay</b> registered Democratic respondents in New York.

5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> as predators.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory {{overview of the}} emergence <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> travel market {{as well as the}} travel motivations <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> men and women.

The present paper reveals that gay tourism literature has failed to catch up with the changing societal environment, therefore the stereotyped and generalised projections on the motivations and social behaviours <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> travellers have perpetrated a distorted understanding <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> travel market...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that most of these early groups stated {{themselves}} to support women's liberation, many <b>of</b> the <b>gay</b> student groups were dominated by men.

This extended to frequently directing attention to campus harassment <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> men while ignoring the concerns and needs <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> women. Gay women were frequently turned off by the focus on male cruising at many of these events, and as a result, lesbians and bisexual women on some campuses began to hold their own dances and social activities.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> tourist victimisation, {{from the viewpoint}} <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> tourists. A review of literature suggests that the victimisation <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> men as tourists has received little attention. This is {{despite the fact that}} both tourists in general and gay men are highly likely to suffer criminal victimisation. The paper questions whether taking these findings together suggests that gay tourists suffer particularly higher levels of victimisation. A qualitative survey of a sample <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> tourists is undertaken with two rounds of interviews. The findings suggest that gay tourists do suffer high levels of victimisation on holiday, though measurement difficulties prevent generalisations. In common with other research, it is also found that: incidents are not reported (for fear of further victimisation in some cases); the types of crime are similar to those suffered by other tourists with additional homophobic related crimes; the lifestyle choices <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> men influence victimisation; offenders of homophobic crimes {{are more likely to be}} other tourists; and gay men are often discriminated against by the tourism industry. The paper concludes by arguing that, although a complex issue, experience and fear of victimisation influence the holiday decision-making processes <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> men...|$|R
