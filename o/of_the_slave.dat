5|$|Although the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Slave</b> Community {{was recognized by}} scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Slave</b> Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

50|$|More {{than half}} a century later, when Grenada was {{captured}} by the British during the Seven Years' War (1762) and formally ceded to Britain by <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Paris, <b>the</b> English began the import their own African slaves for use on their cotton, sugar and tobacco plantations. It is believed that most <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> imported to Grenada embarked from Nigeria (specifically Igbo and Yoruba, more than 37,000, 34% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island) and Ghana (Fante people, more than 18,000, 19% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island). To a lesser extent, slaves were also were imported from Senegambia (more than 5,000, 4.9% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island), Guinea, Sierra Leone (more than 12,000, 11% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island), Windward Coast (more than 14,000, 13% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island), Bight <b>of</b> Benin (more than 5,800, 5,4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island), Congo (specifically Kongos) and Angola. <b>The</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> Central Africa numbered more than 12,000 people, 11% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> <b>of</b> Grenada. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> were also Mandinka.The first British census of Grenada, in 1700, recorded 525 slaves and 53 freed <b>slaves</b> living on <b>the</b> island. Julien Fédon, a mulatto plantation owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belvedere estate in the St. John Parish, led a violent rebellion against British rule on <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> 2 March 1795. Clearly influenced by the ideas emerging from the French Revolution, especially <b>the</b> Convention's abolition <b>of</b> slavery in 1794, Fédon and his troops took control of all <b>of</b> Grenada (except <b>the</b> parish <b>of</b> St. George's, <b>the</b> seat <b>of</b> government), who afterwards freed <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> who participated in the rebellion. <b>The</b> struggle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> for their rights continued {{for a year and a}} half (between March 1795 and June 1796), until the British regained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. The British, as a punishment for disobedience and rebellion, executed <b>the</b> alleged leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, however Fédon was never captured. Slavery in Grenada was finally abolished by a British law in 1834, and all slaves were freed by 1 August 1838.|$|R

5|$|Nri's hegemony {{over much}} of Igboland lasted from the reigns of the fourth eze Nri {{to that of the}} ninth.

Nri hegemony declined after the start of the 18th century. Still, it survived in a much-reduced, and weakened form until 1911. In 1911, British troops forced the reigning eze Nri to renounce the ritual power of the religion known as the ìkénga, ending the kingdom of Nri as a political power.|$|E

5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> Trade ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District. However, despite the decreased interest in abolition, Wilberforce {{continued to}} introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, he {{came into}} contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, {{including}} Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> Trade Act of 1807.|$|E

5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871.

The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and Briton remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service on the Cape Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher.

Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Kentucky {{by a vote}} of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859.

Although he believed in the right of states to secede from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states.

Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
