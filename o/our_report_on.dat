It concludes that a total of 199 people (193 civilians and six policemen) were killed and 763 were injured, a significantly higher figure than the Ethiopian government's claim that 61 civilians and seven policemen were killed. The {{vice chairman of the}} inquiry, judge Wolde-Michael Meshesha, who fled Ethiopia a month prior after he had received anonymous death threats, told AP that [...] "this was a massacre ... these demonstrators were unarmed yet the majority died from shots to the head." [...] He added that the government attempted to pressure and intimidate members of the inquiry after learning about its controversial finding. The Ethiopian government did not [...] immediately comment on the leaked report, but the next day, it told BBC that its contents were [...] "hearsay." [...] The European Union's chief observer during the elections, Ana Maria Gomes, stated that the draft report [...] "only confirms what we have said in <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> the elections," [...] and [...] "that indeed there were massive human rights violations." ...|$|E
5000|$|There was {{an issue}} raised on {{same-sex}} marriages, etc. It is true {{we do not have}} a law allowing same-sex marriages in our country, and that I say again, due to our own traditions and very cultural strong beliefs. Although activities involving same-sex do take place, but they do take place under cover, so to say, and like I said when I was presenting <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> the ICCPR Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that if one were to exhibit such a behavior in public, one could be, actually be stoned by the public itself. It is a cultural thing. It's not yet acceptable. So the government ... it would be very strange for the government to propose a law towards allowing that; so, it's just that maybe time has not come for us to consider such freedoms in our country.|$|E

In <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>on</b> improving training for new acquisition initiatives, we emphasized the importance that industry and government experts place on training to successfully implement such change.
