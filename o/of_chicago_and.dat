5|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills. The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street.

5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez's sister, Gladys, {{worked for}} Ernest Lawrence as a {{part-time}} secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now {{engaged to be married}} to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago,</b> <b>and</b> the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy his neighbors there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

5|$|Chicago Options Associates is {{a finance}} company {{incorporated}} in Chicago, Illinois {{which specializes in}} trading options and futures contracts. It was founded in 1987 by Michael E. Davis (a 1983 MBA graduate from the University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago)</b> <b>and</b> Oliver R. W. Pergams, who received a bachelor's degree from that school in 1981. The company originally had offices in Chicago and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the {{university}}'s fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; {{the university}} underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football {{from the university}} {{in an attempt to}} emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into four divisions. In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> Northwestern University into a single university. During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students. Also, the Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Mayor Daley {{nominated}} Chico {{as chairman}} of the board of trustees of the City Colleges <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> the board elected Chico chairman.

Furthermore, Chico and Hyman reduced taxation on property for two straight years, and cancelled nursing programs. He resigned 8 months later to run for Mayor of Chicago.|$|E
