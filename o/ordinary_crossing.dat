40|$|Wild progeny from intercrosses of {{pyridoxine}} mutants {{have been}} found in tetrads showing irregular segregation of {{one or the other of}} the mutants. [1] These wild types therefore appear not to be true recombinants arising from crossing over between the mutant genes. Earlier, individuals of the genotypes expected to result from two- or three-strand double crossovers involving the regions adjacent to the locus of a pyridoxine mutant had been obtained with surprisingly high frequency from marked crosses between this mutant and its wild allele. [2] Since the frequency was very nearly that with which wild offspring were obtained from intercrosses, the possibility was considered that the apparent double-crossover recombinants might be due not to <b>ordinary</b> <b>crossing</b> over but to the mechanism which operates in the intercross.

However, we might gain further insight by viewing these types of data as a point pattern due to the spatial nature of the dataset which {{would allow us to}} use the spatial information of each point and apply point process techniques.

The <b>ordinary</b> <b>cross</b> J-function is extended to a weighted version by incorporating weights to account for inhomogeneity because this dataset appears to exhibit non-constant intensity. Unlike the <b>ordinary</b> <b>cross</b> J-function, the weighted cross J-function takes into account the varying background rate of the point process by incorporating weights for each point in the point patterns. The advantage of the weighted cross J -function is that it is used to measure the interaction between events in two point processes and to detect clustering or inhibition between them, in order to recognize where spatial interaction appears most prevalent.

40|$|In {{performing}} {{transfer path}} analysis of structure-borne sound transmission, the operational forces at the excitation points and/or at the connections within the structure-borne paths are required. These forces {{can be obtained}} by using inverse techniques but the measured data used will contain some unknown errors. Therefore the reconstructed forces may include large errors due to the inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix of these measured data. In this study, Tikhonov regularization is used in order to improve the conditioning of the matrix inversion. Several methods are available to select the optimal regularization parameter. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the performance of the <b>ordinary</b> and generalized <b>cross</b> validation methods and the L-curve criterion. Simulations are carried out, representing measurements on a rectangular plate, for different noise levels in measured data. Also, the robustness of the conclusions is investigated by varying the shape of the plates, the force positions, and the noise levels included in the measured data. The L-curve method is found to perform better than OCV or GCV, particularly for high noise levels in the operational responses, but less well when these noise levels are low. It is therefore found to be less susceptible to producing large reconstruction errors but it tends to over-regularize the solution in the presence of low noise, leading to under-estimates of the forces. In practice, measurements of operational responses may be susceptible to noise contamination which suggests that the L-curve method is likely to be the most appropriate method in practical situations. Nevertheless, it is important to obtain good estimates of the likely noise in the signals before determining the most appropriate regularization technique. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>cross</b> validation method is generally found to have a better performance than generalized cross validation method if the matrix condition numbers are high. Since the need for regularization is greater with high condition numbers, it is consequently found that the <b>ordinary</b> <b>cross</b> validation method gives more reliable results overall than the generalized cross validation method...|$|R

So called "Kani method" {{is a kind}} of slope-deflection methods, i. e; every {{process of}} Kani Method {{can be explained by the}} slope-deflection method which is solved by Iteration. In the Iteration process of the slope-deflection method, calculating a joint rotation angle moment φ_i is none the less computing the fixed moment of jolnt i in the Kani method except some multiplier, and in the same process, computing a deflection angle moment ψ is not more than calculating the corresponding storey moment of Kani method except some multiplier. Mathematically, Kani method and the slope-deflection method solved by Iteration are identical. 2. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Cross</b> method is also a kind of slope-deflection methods, which solved by Iteration. In the latter process we construct the equations like followings (c. f.

Solving equation (3) by Iteration corresponds to solving the problem by the ordinary moment distribution method in which the given loads act no joint movement occurs. Solving equations(4) by Iterstion is the same process in the ordinary moment distribution method where some horizontal forces act and some joint movements occur and no given load acts. 3. Explaining the both of Kani method and ordinary moment distribution method by the slope-deflection method, as above, it is easy to understand the differences between Kani method and the ordinary moment distribution method. For example, speed of convergence of ordinary moment distribution method is cleary more rapid than that of Kani method, because of the small number of arguments. In the former case, however, the processes of moment distribution and balancing must be repeated some definite number of times and then balancing the horizontal forces are necessary.
