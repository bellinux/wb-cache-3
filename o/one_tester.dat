Recently, a testing theory for CSP has also been presented. In this paper, we explore the problem of testing from a CSP specification when observations are made {{by a set of}} distributed testers. We build on previous work on input-output transition systems, but the use of CSP leads to significant differences, since some of its conformance (refinement) relations consider failures as well as traces. In addition, we allow events to be observed by more than <b>one</b> <b>tester.</b> We show how the CSP notions of refinement can be adapted to distributed testing. We consider two contexts: when the testers are entirely independent and when they can cooperate.

Root weight, dry matter content, dry matter yield per root, circumference of root and height of the root head were analyzed. All of the tested hybrids showed better results for root weight and dry matter yield per root than their parents. It was not possible to predict superior hybrid combination based solely on the characteristics of parents. Parents with the lowest root weight per se produced the test hybrid with the highest root weight. Parents showed a positive correlation between root weight and dry matter content and this could help sugar beet breeders to choose the most suitable selection criteria...|$|R

Twenty-eight college age female volunteers were tested on two occasions by two testers. Pearson product-moment correlations for the intertester reliability were. 72 for day one and. 65 for day two. Analysis of variance was used to derive intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for intratester reliability of true lumbar flexion measurements. Intraclass correlation coefficients were. 92 for <b>tester</b> <b>one</b> and. 88 for tester two. There {{were no significant differences}} (p <. 05) between the means within each tester.

40|$|Cathodic Arc Physical Vapor Deposition (CAPVD), a {{technique}} {{used for the}} deposition of hard coatings, for tooling applications, has many advantages. The main drawback of this technique is the formation of macrodroplets (MDs) during deposition, resulting in films with rougher morphology. Constant etching, by increasing nitrogen gas flow rate up to 200 sccm, helped in reducing the MD size and number; at higher rates, of say 300 sccm, the behavior was reversed. Minimum value of surface roughness recorded at 200 sccm was measured via both surface roughness tester and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Micro-Vickers hardness of TiN-coated tool showed about 564 % times increase in hardness than the uncoated <b>one.</b> Scratch <b>tester</b> was used to study the critical loads for the coating and the excellent adhesion achievable, of say 200 sccm, was demonstrated, with relevance to the various modes.

The proposed method offers higher compression than any other method presented so far, very low shift switching activity and very short test sequence length at the same time. Moreover, contrary to existing techniques, it offers a complete solution for testing multi-core SoCs as it is suitable for cores of both known and unknown structure (IP cores) that usually co-exist in modern SoCs.

30|$|Maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) lateral-pinch assessment occurred using a B&L Engineering pinch gauge (PG- 60; B&L Engineering, CA, USA) which has reported {{reliability and validity}} (Mathiowetz et al. 1984, 1985, 2000). All subjects undertook this assessment with their dominant hand only. To eliminate testing bias, <b>one</b> <b>tester</b> gave instructions and reset the dynamometer and a separate tester viewed and recorded each test result. Subject encouragement was standardised by using previously reported instructions (Mathiowetz et al. 1984). Subjects were tested using the protocol (Mathiowetz et al. 1985) and standardised testing (anatomical) positioning previously described (seated in a chair with arm rests and full back support, the shoulder adducted to neutral and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90 °, forearm in the neutral position, and wrist between 0 ° and 30 ° dorsiflexion and between 0 ° and 15 ° ulnar deviation [Fess and Moran 1981; Mathiowetz et al. 1985]). This also controlled for contribution from accessory musculature. During testing, subjects were instructed to give a maximal effort. Immediately after the first effort was completed, the dynamometer was reset and a second (and final) effort was performed. Note that no rest occurred between efforts.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{selective}} encoding method that reduces test data volume and test application time for scan testing of Intellectual Property (IP) cores. This method encodes the slices of test {{data that are}} fed to the scan chains in every clock cycle. To drive scan chains, we use only tester channels, where = log 2 (+ 1) + 2. In the best case, we can achieve compression {{by a factor of}} using only <b>one</b> <b>tester</b> clock cycle per slice. We derive a sufficient condition on the distribution of care bits that allows us to achieve the best-case compression. We also derive a probabilistic lower bound on the compression for a given care-bit density. Unlike popular compression methods such as Embedded Deterministic Test (EDT), the proposed approach is suitable for IP cores because it does not require structural information for fault simulation, dynamic compaction, or interleaved test generation. The on-chip decoder is small, independent of the circuit under test and the test set, and it can be shared between different circuits. We present compression results for a number of industrial circuits and compare our results to other recent compression methods targeted at IP cores.

40|$|International audienceThe {{subtractive}} suppressive hybridization (SSH), {{a method}} that allows the identification of sequences that are present in <b>one</b> genome (<b>tester)</b> {{but not in the}} other (driver), is a promising technique for the comparison of Mycoplasma agalactiae pathogenic strains. The optimal conditions for SSH were established by subtracting the M. agalactiae type strain PG 2 DNA from the M. agalactiae strain 5632 DNA. Because these two strains possess different vpma gene repertoires, 5632 -specific vpma sequences (and possibly other 5632 -specific sequences) were predicted to be retrieved by SSH. The subtracted tester DNA was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T easy E.  coli vector. Two independent libraries were generated and used to prepare individual probes that were tested by Southern blot with genomic DNA from various field isolates and mycoplasma reference strains. Sequence analysis of two overlapping clones showed that they potentially code for a large carboxyterminal portion of a new vpma ORF. Several DNA fragments homologous to insertion sequences were also found in 5632 and related strains. These preliminary data suggest that SSH is a powerful method to investigate differences between mycoplasma strains, and may be applied to molecular epidemiology, diagnostic, and host specificity or pathogenicity determinant discovery...|$|R
