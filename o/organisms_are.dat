5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> autotrophic, whereas organotrophic <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause {{gastroenteritis}} in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy smears {{are useful}} in the workup of patients with abscesses and inflammatory masses. We report 37 cases classified into three groups: group I, in which a causative <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> seen on the smear; group II, in which a causative <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> cultured from a smear where <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> not seen microscopically, and group III, in which the <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> not seen or cultured, but the smear findings were useful in determining further workup...|$|R
30|$|The causative <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} in 5 cases (22.7  %), Staphylococcus aureus in 12 cases (54.5  %) and Enterococcus faecalis in 1 case. In four cases, no <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> isolated (Table  4).|$|R
25|$|Parthenogenesis is {{distinct}} from artificial animal cloning, a process where the new <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> necessarily genetically identical to the cell donor. In cloning, the nucleus of a diploid cell from a donor <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> inserted into an enucleated egg cell and the cell is then stimulated to undergo continued mitosis, resulting in an <b>organism</b> that <b>is</b> genetically identical to the donor. Parthenogenesis is different, in that it originates from the genetic material contained within an egg cell and the new <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily genetically identical to the parent.|$|R
5|$|Opportunistic infections may {{be caused}} by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are {{normally}} controlled by the immune system. Which infections occur depends partly on what <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> common in the person's environment. These infections may affect nearly every organ system.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and {{the presence or absence}} of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{traits of}} <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> {{subject to change}} through acclimation, development, and evolution. For this reason, {{individuals}} form a shared focus for ecology and for evolutionary ecology.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of BMS- 284756 against 602 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including 152 that were both methicillin and ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC ≥ 4 μg/ml), was determined. For ciprofloxacin-susceptible and nonsusceptible isolates, the MICs at which 50 % of <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> inhibited were 0. 015 and 2 μg/ml and the MICs at which 90 % of <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> inhibited were 0. 03 and 4 μg/ml, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Aztreonam (AZT) (2 g daily) was {{intravenously}} administered for 5 to 7 days to 65 {{patients with}} complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). Ninety one <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> isolated from these patients' urine. Among them 66 <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> eliminated following AZT administration. The elimination rate for Gram negative <b>organisms</b> <b>was</b> 94. 7 % {{and that for}} Gram positive <b>organisms</b> <b>was</b> 33. 3 %. Thirty one organisms appeared newly by the replacement of organisms. Among them, 12 <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> E. faecalis. The efficacy rate of AZT in single infection and in mixed infection was 55. 8 % and 13. 7 %, respectively. The overall clinical efficacy rate of AZT {{in the present study}} was 41. 5 %. As side effects, skin rash and itching were observed in 3 patients and slight elevations in blood chemistry were observed in 10 patients. The results indicate that AZT is an effective drug for the treatment of patients with complicated UTI, especially those caused by Gram negative organisms...|$|R
50|$|Fragmentation or clonal {{fragmentation}} in multi cellular or colonial <b>organisms</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{asexual reproduction}} or cloning in which an <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism.|$|R
5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|All <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> {{constantly}} {{exposed to}} compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
40|$|Although rapid {{emergence}} of antibiotic-resistant mutants of Chlamydia trachomatis {{occurs when the}} <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> grown in subinhibitory concentrations of rifampin, no such mutants could be demonstrated when the <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> propagated under the same conditions in subinhibitory levels of the related drug rifabutin...|$|R
50|$|Spriggina grew {{to around}} three {{centimetres}} in length, and was approximately oblong. The <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> segmented, with no fused segments, with the segments sometimes being curved.

5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence {{of the presence of}} eukaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> built.|$|E
50|$|The {{coding region}} of an <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> {{the sum total}} of the <b>organism's</b> genome that <b>is</b> {{composed}} of gene coding regions.|$|R
50|$|Fragmentation in {{multicellular}} or colonial <b>organisms</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{asexual reproduction}} or cloning where an <b>organism</b> <b>is</b> split into fragments.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{resistant}} to both gentamicin and carbenicillin was isolated {{with increasing frequency}} at the Cincinnati Veterans Administration Hospital during the period 1971 to 1974. A comparison of patients from whom P. aeruginosa was isolated during this period failed to reveal any significant clinical differences between the patients colonized or infected with resistant organisms and those colonized or infected with susceptible organisms. Overt clinical infection attributable to either <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> rare. The antibiotic-resistant <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> isolated most frequently from urine. Isolation of the antibiotic-resistant <b>organisms</b> <b>was</b> more frequent from patients who had previously received gentamicin...|$|R
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do {{not appear to}} play a {{significant}} role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100°C, the {{concentration of}} titanium in water {{is estimated to be}} less than 10−7 M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.|$|E
50|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the incident 5,268 organisms, the majority of which were dead, were estimated to have washed ashore. Many live <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> also found both on and offshore covered in oil. Of the 5,268 <b>organisms</b> 152 species <b>were</b> picked up after the spill by scientists and volunteers from the Caribbean Stranding Network (CSN) and various other organizations. These <b>organisms</b> <b>were</b> both living and dead. <b>Organisms</b> found <b>were</b> sponges, anemones, sea worms, crustaceans, mollusks, sea stars, sea urchins, fish, birds, and sea turtles.|$|R
30|$|The {{isolated}} <b>organism</b> <b>was</b> multiplied {{prior to}} fermentation by culturing them on Malt Extract Broth (MEB) and incubating for 48 – 72  h at 27.0  °C ±  0.02.

5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These <b>organisms</b> <b>are</b> also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
