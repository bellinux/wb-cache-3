5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E

5|$|The fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and pallid cuckoo (C.pallidus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. One fan-tailed cuckoo was recorded ejecting baby robins before being raised by its foster parents. Other nest predators recorded include the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis).|$|E
5|$|Variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> fougasse {{included}} the demigasse, a barrel {{on its side}} and left in the open with explosive buried underneath; and the hedge hopper: a barrel on end with explosive buried underneath a few inches deep and slightly off centre. On firing, the hedge hopper barrel was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Woman of the Year was {{followed}} by an adaptation of John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat (1942) which met with a tepid response. MGM {{did not hesitate to}} repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> (1942). Despite a weak critical reception the film was a popular success, outgrossing its predecessor and confirming the strength of the partnership.|$|E

5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame,</b> while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Hepburn {{returned}} to Broadway {{to appear in}} another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message {{on the dangers of}} fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine {{family tree}} is unclear; the Petroicidae are not {{closely related to}} either the European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E

5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame,</b> while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E

Keenan was then fired a month after <b>the</b> <b>Flames</b> were eliminated from the 2008-09 playoffs by Chicago. Brent Sutter, former coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Devils, was selected as <b>the</b> new <b>Flames</b> coach in June 2009. On December 28, 2010, Sutter resigned as <b>the</b> general manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flames.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hepburn's {{next film}} was Undercurrent (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama {{set in the}} American Old West {{entitled}} The Sea of Grass. Similarly to Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> and Without Love, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success {{both at home and}} abroad. The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By the time of its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love. Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy–Hepburn picture. Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box-office.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{continues}} his ascent, murdering powerful foes {{that include the}} Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. The Spartan chases the god, who leads him to the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flame.</b> Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and {{is key to the}} success of his quest, as it was in God of War. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims {{that he was trying to}} protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.|$|E
