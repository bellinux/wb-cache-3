5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

5000|$|The Lithuanian {{name for}} moonshine is naminė degtinė or in short naminė or naminukė (naminė means 'homemade'); also the word samagonas (from Russian samogon) is <b>often</b> used. <b>Quite</b> <b>often</b> samagonas is shorted to samanė which connotates {{with the word}} samanos (means 'moss') as usually Lithuanian moonshine is made illegally, thus hiding in the woods.|$|R

25|$|According to a newer natural {{geographic}} regionalisation, {{the country}} {{consists of four}} macroregions. These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the Pannonian landscapes. Macroregions are defined according to major relief units (the Alps, the Pannonian plain, the Dinaric mountains) and climate types (submediterranean, temperate continental, mountain climate). These are <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> interwoven.|$|E
25|$|Fourth grade (or sixth, {{depending}} on the state) is <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> stressful for students of lower performance and their families. Many feel tremendous pressure when trying to achieve placement in Gymnasium, or at least when attempting to avoid placement in Hauptschule. Germany is unique compared to other western countries in its early segregation of students based on academic achievement.|$|E
25|$|Although often nesting {{close to}} human activity, some Swainson's hawks are very easily {{disturbed}} at the nest and often desert, especially {{early in the}} season. The bird is <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> tame and {{an easy target for}} shooters traveling isolated prairie roads. The species may also be affected in ways yet to be understood by some insecticides and herbicides, including those used on its wintering grounds.|$|E

25|$|Attempts to find wanted {{or missing}} {{individuals}} through public alert systems sometimes {{make use of}} a type of event based prospective memory called prospective person memory. In prospective person memory, {{a picture of a}} wanted or missing person is presented to the public with instructions to report any sightings of the individual to authorities. Field experiments show that prospective person memory is <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> poor.|$|E
25|$|Low-heeled {{leather shoes}} {{fastened}} with buckles were worn with silk or woollen stockings. Boots were worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver (sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style), or with paste stones, {{although there were}} other types. These buckles were <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> large {{and one of the}} world's largest collections can be seen at Kenwood House.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} the stories are based on {{articles}} (<b>often</b> <b>quite</b> brief mentions) which appeared in railway enthusiast publications of the period. There were very few of these publications compared to modern times, but the monthly Railway Magazine was a long-running enthusiasts' companion and the origins of several stories can be recognised, as also the railway books and histories written by Mr Hamilton Ellis, {{one of the early}} railway book writers.|$|E

Conversely, Vang Pao's troops were being amply supplied via air bridge; brand new M16 rifles were being secretively provided for his troops.|$|E
25|$|The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) was {{developed}} by Smith et al. (2000) to measure self-reports of prospective and retrospective memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a questionnaire consisting of 16 items; in which participants rank how often memory failure occurs using a 5-point scale (Very <b>Often,</b> <b>Quite</b> Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never). The PRMQ equally assesses three variables: prospective and retrospective memory, short-term memory and long-term memory, and self-cued and environmentally-cued memory.|$|E
25|$|The men {{of letters}} in the Mysore royal court {{included}} not only the court poets, who were <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> prolific, but also on occasion the rulers themselves. In the post Vijayanagara period, {{a new kind of}} lyrical poetry, one unaffiliated with the royal court, and written by maverick-poets was gaining popularity. A wide range of metres, indigenous and Sanskritic, were popular including tripadi (3-line verse), shatpadi (6-line verse) and saptapadi (7-line verse) metres, and gadya (prose).|$|E
