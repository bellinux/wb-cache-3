2500|$|During {{interviews}} {{following the}} release of the book, Berg compared Wilson's diplomacy to President Obama's handling of the Syria crisis: â€œOver the last few weeks, <b>Obama</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> addressing the crisis in a very Wilsonian manner, raising {{the question of whether the}} United States was meant to be the policeman of the world."

2500|$|Not all {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Federalist No. 70 justifies {{the role that}} the President has played {{in the war on terror}} up to this point. Some scholars contend that President Bush's foreign policy decisions exceeded his presidential powers granted by the Constitution. Further, critics of the Bush Administration argue that any executive, as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 70, must act within the limits imposed by other provisions of the United States Constitution [...] and that the concept of the unitary executive does not allow the president to work outside laws passed by Congress, even when they conflict with national security interests. These critics argue that President Bush could have asked Congress to amend existing law or retroactively obtain warrants for surveillance and that he violated the constitution when he did not. President <b>Obama</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> similarly criticized for operating outside the law, despite statements at the beginning of his presidency which showed a desire to limit the use of signing statements to expand executive power.|$|E

2500|$|Obama's {{election}} also {{provoked a}} reaction to his race, birthplace, and religion. As president, Obama faced numerous taunts and racial innuendos, though most overt racist comments were limited to a small fringe.

50|$|One {{difficulty}} of the American government is {{that the lack of}} oversight for Presidents offers no safeguards for presidential incompetency. For example, Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasingly criticized for his expansive views on executive powers and mismanaging of several situation, including the Syrian Civil War.
