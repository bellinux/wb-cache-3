40|$|For any Lie groupoid we {{construct}} an analytic index morphism taking values in a modified K-theory group which involves the convolution algebra of compactly supported smooth functions over the groupoid. The construction is performed {{by using the}} deformation algebra of smooth functions over the tangent groupoid constructed in Ca 2. This allows in particular to prove a more primitive version of the Connes-Skandalis Longitudinal index Theorem for foliations, that is, an index theorem taking values in a group which pairs with Cyclic cocycles. As other application, for D a -PDO elliptic operator with associated index ind D∈ K_ 0 (_c ()), we prove that the pairing, with τ a bounded continuous cyclic cocycle, only depends on the principal symbol class [σ(D) ]∈ K^ 0 (A^*). The result is completely general for Étale groupoids. We discuss some potential applications to the Novikov's conjecture.
