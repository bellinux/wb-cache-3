2500|$|Atatürk {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by the triumph of laïcité in France. Atatürk perceived the French model as the authentic form of secularism. Kemalism strove to control religion and transform it into a private affair rather than an institution interfering with politics, scientific and social progress. [...] "Sane reason," [...] and [...] "the liberty of [...] fellow man," [...] as Atatürk <b>once</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> It is more than merely creating a separation between state and religion. Atatürk {{has been described as}} working as if he were Leo the Isaurian, Martin Luther, the Baron d’Holbach, Ludwig Büchner, Émile Combes, and Jules Ferry rolled into one in creating Kemalist secularism. Kemalist secularism does not imply nor advocate agnosticism or nihilism; it means freedom of thought and independence of the institutions of the state from the dominance of religious thought and religious institutions. The Kemalist principle of laicism is not against moderate and apolitical religion, but against religious forces opposed to and fighting modernization and democracy.|$|E

In short, during the Great Purge, the Central Committee was liquidated. Stalin managed to liquidate the Central Committee with the committee's own consent, as Molotov <b>once</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> [...] "This gradually occurred. Seventy expelled 10–15 persons, then 60 expelled 15... In essence {{this led to a}} situation where a minority of this majority remained within the Central Committee... Such was the gradual but rather rapid process of clearing the way." [...] Several members were expelled from the Central Committee through voting. Of the 139 members elected to the Central Committee at the 17th Congress, 98 people were killed in the period 1936–40. In this period the Central Committee decreased in size; a 78 percent decrease. By the 18th Congress there were only 31 members of the Central Committee, and of these only two were reelected.|$|E

2500|$|Right {{from the}} start, the Japanese Army planned to turn Manchukuo into the {{industrial}} powerhouse of the Japanese empire {{and carried out}} a policy of forced industrialization with a reckless disregard for human life; the model for Manchukuo was the Soviet First Five Year Plan. Deeply distrustful of capitalism, the military completely excluded the Zaibatsu from investing in Manchukuo, and instead all of the industrial development of Manchuria {{was carried out by}} state-owned corporations. Reflecting the military's ideas about the [...] "national defense state", Manchukuo's industrial development was focused completely upon heavy industry such as steel production for the purposes of arms manufacture. In 1935, Kishi was appointed Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi was given complete control of Manchukuo's economy by the military, with the authority to do whatever he liked just as long as industrial growth was increased. After his appointment, Kishi persuaded the military to allow private capital into Manchukuo, successfully arguing that the military's policy of having the state-owned corporations leading Manchukuo's industrial development was costing the Japanese state too much money. Kishi envisioned a [...] "planned economy" [...] for Manchukuo where bureaucrats such as himself would direct the zaibatsu into selected industries, which would create the necessary industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state". In place of the previous policy of [...] "one industry, one firm" [...] for Manchukuo, Kishi brought in a new policy of [...] "all industries, one firm". One of the zaibatsu that Kishi selected to invest in Manchukuo, the Nissan group, was headed by another of Kishi's uncles. In order to make it profitable for the zaibatsu to invest in Manchukuo, Kishi had a policy of lowering the wages of the workers to the lowest possible point, even below the [...] "line of necessary social reproduction" [...] as he <b>once</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> The purpose of Manchukuo was to provide the industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state" [...] with Driscoll noting [...] "Kishi's planned economy was geared towards production goals and profit taking, not competition with other Japanese firms; profit come primarily from rationalizing labor costs as much as possible. The ne plus ultra of wage rationalization would be withholding pay altogether-that is unremunerated forced labor." ...|$|E

5000|$|While Gambino's family enjoyed {{increased}} profits, other mobsters, {{most notably}} Vito Genovese, grew concerned about Anastasia's violently erratic behavior. In 1952, Anastasia ordered {{the murder of}} a young Brooklyn tailor's assistant named Arnold Schuster, after watching Schuster talking on television about his role in the capture of bank robber Willie Sutton. In killing Schuster, Anastasia had violated a Mafia rule against killing outsiders; as Bugsy Siegel <b>once</b> quaintly <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "We only kill each other." [...] The murder brought unnecessary public scrutiny on Mafia business. Luciano and Costello were horrified by the killing, but they could not take action against Anastasia as he was needed in their power struggle against Genovese.
