5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly {{susceptible to the}} effect of acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|It {{was built}} by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 {{at a cost of}} 1 million rupees, and was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan. The mosque was {{completed}} in 1656 AD with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 persons. There are three domes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total of 899 black borders are marked for worshippers.

5|$|Trump {{also claimed}} {{to own the}} {{painting}} Two Sisters (<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrace),</b> an 1881 work by French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. In October 2017, Timothy L. O'Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book , he asked Trump about the copy of Two Sisters, which was then located on Trump's plane. Trump repeatedly said that his copy was the genuine work, despite O'Brien's statements to the contrary. By then, the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump's penthouse office, and the Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump's claim that his Renoir copy was the genuine one.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Terrace,</b> and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Number 16 is a {{house is}} two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted {{limestone}} walls and a corrugated sheet metal roof behind a parapet.

40|$|The {{formation}} of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) surfaces is studied using atomic force microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical measurements. Starting from hydrogen-annealed surfaces, graphene formation by vacuum annealing is observed {{to begin at}} about 1150 °C, with the overall step-terrace arrangement of the surface being preserved but with significant roughness (pit formation) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>terraces.</b> At higher temperatures near 1250 °C the step morphology changes, with <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> becoming more compact. At 1350 °C and above, the surface morphology changes into relatively large flat terraces separated by step bunches. Features believed to arise from grain boundaries in the graphene are resolved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>terraces,</b> as are fainter features attributed to atoms at the buried graphene/SiC interface...|$|R
