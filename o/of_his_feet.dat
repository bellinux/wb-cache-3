After losing his job because of his membership, Hitler hired him as his personal aide, a position he held for 25 years.|$|E
5|$|While in Tahiti, Brooke suffers {{an injury}} to one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and is nursed by the {{beautiful}} Taatama, a local woman. Then Brook and Taatama romance each other, eventually having sex and impregnating Taatama. After several months of exploring the island, Brooke decides to return home. Before his departure Brooke leave writes Nell a letter which contains a black pearl. Nell, now married to a local carter, receives the pearl and letter soon after she gives birth to a child by Brooke.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Kippenberger was appointed to command the 20th Battalion. He led the battalion for two years, through the Battles of Greece and Crete as well as part of the North African Campaign before being promoted to brigadier and taking command of the 5th Infantry Brigade. The pinnacle of his military career was as commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Italian Campaign. He was wounded on 3 March 1944 during the Battle of Monte Cassino when he stepped on a land mine. As a result of his wounds, he lost both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> After recovery in England, during which he was fitted with artificial limbs, he helped prepare for and assisted in the repatriation of newly released New Zealand prisoners of war. In 1946, he was appointed Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45. He was still working on the project when he died on 5 May 1957 in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had slipped on the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto the soles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, he lay on his stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Nate Clements intercepted a McCown pass, and led to another 49ers touchdown. The 49ers led 21–13, but Tampa Bay still kept hopes alive for a rally. With less than six {{minutes left in the}} game, the Buccaneers drove to the 49ers 25-yard line. On 4th down and 6, McCown threw to Michael Clayton for an {{apparent}} one-handed touchdown catch, but the ball fell incomplete, and the drive turned over on downs. Tampa Bay managed one final chance to tie the score. Inside the two-minute warning, Tampa Bay drove to the 49ers 24-yard line. McCown rolled out wide to his right, and connected with Stevens for a 24-yard touchdown. McCown then attempted a game-tying two-point conversion. Michael Clayton caught the pass, but one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> touched out-of-bounds {{in the back of the}} endzone, sealing the game for San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers, {{playing with}} the goal of keeping the Kansas City Chiefs’ Wing-T offense on the bench as much as possible, held them to little more than half of their regular rushing average. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers’ offense had their most {{productive}} day ever, setting a team record with three fourth-quarter touchdowns. Jimmy DuBose ran for two touchdowns and Louis Carter for one, and Doug Williams threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Kansas City was held to a pair of Jan Stenerud field goals for most of the game. A fourth-quarter Tony Adams pass was ruled a touchdown, although replays showed that receiver Henry Marshall failed to keep both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> inbounds. Richard Wood was given much of the credit for stifling the Chiefs’ league-leading rushing attack. Wood correctly expected that Chiefs offensive coordinator Tom Pagna would run the offense straight at him, as he did when Wood played at USC and Pagna coached at Notre Dame. Pagna assumed incorrectly that the undersized Wood would be overpowered, but Wood instead responded by making 12 tackles. This was the Buccaneers’ third consecutive road win, and came one day after the Kansas City Royals were eliminated from the American League pennant race.|$|E

In addition, black strips of cloth wrapped around his forearms, hands, and head, leaving his eyes and mouth exposed.

500|$|The {{medical staff}} were also worried, because a {{systemic}} illness with intestinal inflammation, such as colitis, {{is a common}} precursor to laminitis, a painful inflammation of the internal structures of the hoof.

Although his blood test results and protein levels began to stabilize, he nevertheless developed laminitis in three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> on September 4, ten days after {{he arrived at the}} center.

500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} chapter of the Bala Kanda Book of the Adhyatma Ramayana (embedded in the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century) is {{dedicated}} to the Ahalya episode. Like most other versions of the story, Ahalya is turned into stone and advised to engross herself in meditation of Rama, [...] "the Supreme Lord". When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra's advice, Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama. She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects. After worshipping him, she returns to Gautama. At the end of the narrative, Ahalya's hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama's favour. The Awadhi Ramacharitamanasa (16th century) drops the narrative of Indra's visit to Ahalya. In this epic, Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama's feet. Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse, and she deems it as the greatest favour, for as a result, she feasted her eyes on Rama, who liberated her from her worldly existence. As in the Adhyatma Ramayana, Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities, asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband's abode. The narrative ends with praise for Rama's compassion. Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the Ramacharitamanasa while highlighting the significance of Rama's benevolence. Commenting on this narrative in the Ramacharitamanasa, Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things: the sin of Ahalya by his sight, the curse by the dust <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and the affliction by the touch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> evidenced by the use of the Tribhangi (meaning [...] "destroyer of the three") metre in the verses which form Ahalya's panegyric.|$|E
