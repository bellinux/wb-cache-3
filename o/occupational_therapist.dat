40|$|Background: Primary care (PC) is an {{emerging}} practice setting for occupational therapy; however, few <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> currently practice {{in this setting}} due to barriers, including uncertainty about reimbursement {{and the role of}} <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists.</b> This pilot study aimed to determine if PC providers and <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> are receptive to <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> as integrated interprofessional PC team members if barriers to inclusion are addressed. Method: After a brief educational paragraph explaining potential occupational therapy contributions to PC teams, the participants accessed a link to survey questions regarding their personal level of receptiveness to occupational therapy in PC. The questions comprised Likert scale and open-ended answers. Results: Of the Likert scale responses, 94 %- 99 % provided by <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> and 82 %- 97 % provided by PC providers indicated possibly or yes to the inclusion of <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> on the PC team. The descriptive responses were primarily supportive. Discussion: The majority of the <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> and PC providers surveyed indicated support for including <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> in primary care. This indicates that when barriers are addressed, <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> and PC providers are receptive to the inclusion of <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> as members of the interprofessional PC team...|$|R
40|$|It is the {{position}} of the Canadian Association of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Therapists</b> (CAOT) that entry-level <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> in Canada require advanced knowledge and skills as outlined in the Profile of Practice of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Therapists</b> in Canada (2012) Advanced knowledge and skills are required to be accountable for professional decisions and autonomous practice in diverse environments with multicultural populations. <b>Occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> must provide evidence-based and occupationally-focused services, and have the ability to market their services in an expanding and competitive global environment. In Canada, the knowledge, skills and abilities required of entry-level practice are acquired through university education programs for <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> that are accredited by the Canadian Association of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Therapists</b> and lead to a professional Master’s degree in occupational therapy. Recommendations for occupational therapists: 1. All <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> are expected to pursue entry level and continuing education to ensure their level of occupational therapy knowledge, skills and abilities is consistent with the current edition of the Profile of Practice of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Therapists</b> in Canada (2012), and the current requirements of their provincial regulatory body...|$|R

The research is a post-hoc analysis of survey results that formed part of the 1995 Professional Development Strategy for Adult Mental Health Services for the Queensland Health Mental Health Unit. A sample of 55 <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> was compared with other professionals in relation to both general self-efficacy and efficacy in specific competencies.

The results indicated that the general self-perceived competence of <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> for the whole sample was comparable to that of other professional groups, but that in the community-based sample it was significantly higher than that of social workers or nurses. In addition, <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> in community settings had significantly higher general self-perceived competence than <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> in hospital locations. Greater length of experience in mental health was strongly predictive of higher levels of competence for <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> than for other professionals.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> {{working within}} Australia’s dynamic and complex publicly-funded health sector may {{experience}} ethical dilemmas as they fulfill their professional responsibilities, compromising client care, straining collegial relationships and negatively affecting their personal well-being. This thesis describes and explores {{the nature of}} the ethical dilemmas experienced by public practice <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists.</b> Section One: LITERATURE REVIEW The literature review comprises two parts. First a background to ethics in health care is outlined, where the Person-Environment-Occupation Model is presented as a way of evaluating the ethical dilemmas experienced by <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists.</b> This is followed by a review of literature exploring the ethical dilemmas experienced by health professionals including <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists,</b> speech pathologists, physiotherapists, social workers, rehabilitation counsellors and nursing and medical professionals. However, no literature was identified exploring the nature of ethical dilemmas experienced by public practice <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists,</b> providing an opportunity for further research.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> play a {{significant}} role in the discharge process and are often exposed to ethically challenging decision-making. This paper examines the moral basis of discharge planning, relating it to the four fundamental bio-ethical principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Using a case study design, data was collected from 10 <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> and two elder care patients using the critical incident approach, as part of a wider study to determine their perceptions of discharge planning and multidisciplinary teamwork. Direct observation of interaction within multidisciplinary teams was also undertaken. The findings from the research suggest that <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> are unintentionally breaching these four principles and therefore their code of ethics and professional conduct. It is suggested that further research is needed to determine how <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> overcome these challenges. Furthermore, this research has important implications for education establishments regarding the teaching of ethics to <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> reasoning about lifestyle balance among people in psychiatric care. The writer used a qualitative design and interviewed five <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> working in psychiatric care in northern Sweden, using a semi structured interview guide. The data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results generated three main categories: “Having balance”, “Finding motivation” and “Supporting change”. The <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> reasoned that personal economy was an important part of having balance. Further, the <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> reasoned about group activities as a source for motivation. Reasoning was also about group activities as a motivation for living a healthier lifestyle. Encouraging personal planning was reasoned as one way to support lifestyle changes.

40|$|Introduction Research into {{technology}} adoption {{has focused}} on older adults’ motivations, with less exploration of the perspective of healthcare providers, including <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists,</b> who are often described as the gatekeepers to assisted living technology. Method This qualitative study utilized semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 20 <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> in England and Scotland. The goal was to identify those enabling factors necessary for <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> to adopt assisted living technology. Results Five themes emerged regarding the enablers needed to support the adoption of assisted living technology by <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists,</b> including: (1) a positive client–therapist relationship; (2) affordability; (3) time; (4) increased awareness, education, and training; and (5) usability features of the assisted living technology. Conclusion With an aging population and the increasing role that technology is playing globally in older adults’ lives, {{it has never been}} more important for <b>occupational</b> <b>therapists</b> to harness the potential of new, developing, and existing technologies to support people to live and age as well as possible.
