However, the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn, but Finn angrily scolds him and tells {{him to leave the}} kingdom. Finn and Jake then focus their energy <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> care of Princess Bubblegum, whose behavior seems off. At first, she claims that she needs some rest, but soon she begins acting strangely, such as convulsing in her bed. Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests—which includes weapons-grade plutonium, ammonium, and gasoline among other items—and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

5|$|Cousse's message {{confirmed}} {{the fears of}} Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud was intent <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal {{to the international community}} to end the French advance. On 23 July, Al-'Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units. French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and {{war broke out}} between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E

5|$|James Broun-Ramsay, the Marquess of Dalhousie became Lord Warden; on his death, the Prime Minister Henry Temple, the Viscount Palmerston, {{took over}} the castle in 1861. Palmerston {{initially}} declined to buy {{the contents of the}} castle from his predecessor's estate <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> up the post, a practice which had become traditional for the Lords Warden, complaining about the high price being proposed. This raised the risk that the historical contents of the castle might be sold off at open auction; and some of Wellington's former belongings were therefore removed by his family for safekeeping.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>taking</b> {{office as}} Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>taking</b> office, Welensky {{was forced}} to take sides in the Suez Crisis. The {{government}} of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics. In {{the aftermath of the}} Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E

Patty insists <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> the case to trial rather than accepting a settlement, but on Ellen's first day it is revealed that the prosecution cannot yet link Frobisher to his stockbroker—though both were in Palm Beach, Florida over the same weekend—and thus cannot disprove that the selling of his stock was not pre-arranged. When Ellen returns home, her boyfriend David Connor (Noah Bean) proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E

The Queen insisted <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> Karim with her on her travels, which caused arguments between her and her other attendants. Following Victoria's death in 1901, her successor, Edward VII, returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi's correspondence with Victoria. Karim subsequently lived quietly near Agra, on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him, until his death at the age of 46.|$|E

Nana asks Toto to visit frequently, {{and over the}} next several days Nana pushes away Herman. Nenny, meanwhile, uses her sister's interest in Toto to become closer to Herman. When Nana announces that she and Toto are engaged, her grandmother is furious; if Nana marries before her sister, she says, Nunung will never marry.|$|E

Their plan was temporarily put on hold when Marty Jannetty and the 1-2-3 Kid won the belts, but the Quebecers won a rematch the following week, guaranteeing that the Harts would get their title shot.|$|E
5|$|Boniface of Savoy (c. 1217– 18 July 1270) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Belley in France and Archbishop of Canterbury in England. He {{was the son}} of Thomas, Count of Savoy, and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father. Other members of his family were also clergymen, and a brother succeeded his father as count. One niece was married to King Henry III of England and another was married to King Louis IX of France. It was Henry who secured Boniface's {{election}} as Archbishop, and throughout his tenure of that office he spent much time on the continent. He clashed with his bishops, with his nephew-by-marriage, and with the papacy, but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt which he had inherited <b>on</b> <b>taking</b> office. During Simon de Montfort's struggle with King Henry, Boniface initially helped Montfort's cause, but later supported the king. After his death in Savoy, his tomb became the object of a cult, and he was eventually beatified in 1839.|$|E

40|$|Professor Joseph Sax's {{scholarship}} <b>on</b> the <b>Takings</b> Clause {{combines the}} craft of a first-class lawyer with the passion of a visionary. His scholarship reflects a deep understanding of Supreme Court case law, legal history, and the practical dimensions of various kinds of land use disputes. Yet his work <b>on</b> <b>takings</b> is not animated by any desire for mere doctrinal tidiness. It is driven by a distinctive vision [...] {{one in which the}} earth's resources are becoming increasingly interconnected and in which there is an increasing need for the government to resolve conflicts regarding the use of these resources. Each of his writings <b>on</b> the <b>Takings</b> Clause, be it a law review article, speech, or book review, offers fresh insights in response to unfolding developments in compensation law. This Article proceeds as follows. First, I describe Professor Sax's scholarship <b>on</b> the <b>Takings</b> Clause, organizing that work into four clusters defined both chronologically and by institutional affiliation. Then I examine certain recurring themes in the scholarship and consider how those themes develop (or fail to develop) over time. Finally, I focus more closely on Professor Sax's conviction that a proper understanding of the Takings Clause requires a redefinition of "property" and suggest that this premise may not be necessary to promote some of his underlying objectives...|$|R
