5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that {{it must have been the}} same strain <b>of</b> <b>flu.</b> This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the very}} first {{confirmed}} outbreak was at Camp Funston, Fort Riley, Kansas, then a military training facility preparing American troops for involvement in World War I. The first victim diagnosed with the new strain <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> on Monday, March 11, 1918, was mess cook Private Albert Gitchell. Historian Alfred W. Crosby recorded that the flu originated in Kansas, and popular writer John Barry echoed Crosby in describing Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
5|$|To Ann's surprise, Chris (Rob Lowe) {{has also}} been {{admitted}} to the hospital with the flu. The two have been dating and, although Ann really likes Chris, she fears he is too perfect. However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann feel less intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses have agreed to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{meanwhile}} continued working {{towards the}} A∴A∴ grade of Zelator, while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund {{following the death}} of White, a key member, who had succumbed to Spanish Flu aged 33 in November 1918. Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community; there he gained work as a clerk with the Detroit City Gas Company. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge. In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family. That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the Universal Brotherhood (UB). Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to Roman Catholicism, and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose; he soon dropped out. Back in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in Kamloops, creating all the furniture for their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922.|$|E

25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} a virus is the release of {{completed}} viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> strains.|$|E

Soon after the outbreak of H1N1 virus in the United States and Mexico in March, the Government of India started screening people coming from the affected countries at airports for swine flu symptoms. The first case <b>of</b> the <b>flu</b> in India was found on the Hyderabad airport on 13 May, when a man traveling from US to India was found H1N1 positive. Subsequently, more confirmed cases were reported and as the rate of transmission <b>of</b> the <b>flu</b> increased in the beginning of August, with the first death due to swine flu in India in Pune, panic began to spread.

25|$|The mid-1970s were {{important}} for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.|$|E

25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, rimantadine, saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine {{probably}} would not {{be available in the}} initial stages of population infection. A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The Avian Flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types <b>of</b> <b>flu</b> virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.|$|E

The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
