This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> taking money from the drawer without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but {{still has to be}} given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory).|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} allows {{employers to}} fire at will {{during the first}} two years of employment, after which legal justification is required. The flexibility clause was a major break with the protective conditions usually applying to long-term job contracts in France. Under the usual long-term job contract, an employer needs to justify the firing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee.</b> If an employer terminates the contract during its first two years, they must provide advance notice of two weeks to one month. An employee may terminate the contract with no advance notice during its first two years. After the first two years the contract is identical to the existing long-term contract, with protective measures for the employee. The CNE also limits to 12 months the period during which an employee can contest their firing before labor-law courts; in ordinary contracts, the period is 30 years.|$|E
25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor playing the role <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were {{in exactly the same}} location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E

25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue or as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> {{incentive}} scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below {{the market value of}} the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} film roles {{available}} to him, he returned to music during the 1960s. In the early 1970s, Belafonte appeared in more films among which are two with Poitier: Buck and the Preacher (1972) and Uptown Saturday Night (1974). In 1984, Belafonte produced and scored the musical film Beat Street, dealing {{with the rise of}} hip-hop culture. Together with Arthur Baker, he produced the gold-certified soundtrack of the same name. Belafonte next starred in a major film again in the mid-1990s, appearing with John Travolta in the race-reverse drama White Man's Burden (1995); and in Robert Altman's jazz age drama Kansas City (1996), the latter of which garnered him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in the TV drama Swing Vote (1999). In 2006, Belafonte appeared in Bobby, Emilio Estevez's ensemble drama about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy; he played Nelson, a friend <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> of the Ambassador Hotel (Anthony Hopkins).|$|E
25|$|Additional {{problems}} have arisen {{when attempting to}} establish where detours and leave from duty take an employee out of {{the course of his}} employment. One idea which is used in this area is that an employer will only be found liable where an employee is going about his business in a standard way. For example, a minor detour would not take an employee out of the course of his employment, but a 'frolic of his own', which did not at all involve his duties, would. Journeys to and from work, and whether these are regarded as in the course of employment, were considered in Smith v Stages, where Lord Lowry established several factors for determining liability. Ordinarily, employees will not be in the course of employment travelling to and from work, unless their transport is provided by their employer. However, travelling to an alternative place of work or to a workplace, during the employer's time, will be in the course of employment. Where course of employment generally begins with travelling to work has been established in the case of Compton v McClure. Here, an employer was found liable for the negligent driving <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>employee,</b> who, in an effort to clock in on time, injured another employee at the place of employment. It was stated that the 'least artificial place' to establish employment began was at the gates of the employer's factory, where they established speed limits, and supervised conduct.|$|E

Competition finally resumed in 1920 with the 8th Grey Cup game, won 16–3 by the Varsity Blues over the Argonauts. It was the University of Toronto's fourth, and final, championship.|$|E
