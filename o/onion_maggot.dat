40|$|Brian Nault, Jan Nyrop, Alan TaylorInsect pest {{activity}} is often concentrated {{in certain areas}} within crops. Past {{research has suggested that}} <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), adult activity and oviposition may be concentrated along onion field edges and may be affected by the surrounding landscape. To examine this further yellow sticky cards were placed at varying distances along transects extending from edges of commercial onion fields that either bordered or did not border woods. Sticky cards were collected and replaced weekly throughout the 2002 and 2003 growing season. To determine if oviposition by first-generation <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> is concentrated along wooded field edges, potted onion plants were placed along edges and in centers of onion fields that either bordered or did not border woods. Results indicate that adult activity of both sexes is concentrated along edges of onion fields during the first- and second-generations of <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> especially next to woods in the first generation. These ?edge effects? lessened as the season progressed and were not present during the third-generation. Oviposition was uniform with respect to distance from the edge and type of bordering habitat. It may be possible to limit application of insecticides targeting adult <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> to wooded field edges during the first-generation or to deploy cultural controls here. A delay in planting the onion crop has been recommended, but never evaluated, as a method of reducing <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> damage. A delay in planting will also result in plants being younger at the time <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> becomes damaging, and plants may be more susceptible to <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> when they are young. In contrast, planting early might result in onions being older and inherently more tolerant of <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> damage. To determine how planting date affects levels of <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> damage, damage was evaluated in three sequentially-planted onion plots in a commercial onion field in 2003. Earliest plantings coincided with the earliest commercial sowing date and delayed plantings were made three and six weeks later. To determine how plant age affects resistance to <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> damage to onions of different ages was evaluated in the laboratory after they were infested with varying densities of <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> eggs. Ovipositional preference by <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> for differently aged onions was also investigated in the lab to determine if a preference for early plantings could result in egg densities being greater on these plants in the field. <b>Onion</b> <b>maggot</b> damage was high in earliest plantings (37 %), lower but economically unacceptable in intermediate plantings (21 %), and lowest in late plantings (2 %). While the latest planting provided acceptable control, planting this late is not currently feasible for New York growers because they prefer to plant as early as possible to maximize size of onion bulbs at harvest. <b>Onion</b> <b>maggot</b> laid more eggs on older than younger plants in choice tests; therefore more eggs may be laid on early vs. delayed plantings in the field. Older plants were more resistant to maggot attack than younger plants at low egg densities, but not at high ones. This may explain why early plantings are more heavily damaged than delayed ones in the field; greater numbers of eggs may be laid on early plantings if they are preferred for oviposition, resulting in damage being higher in early than delayed plantings.

40|$|Several {{insect pests}} of {{economic}} importance are encountered on vegetable crops. Being high value crops, {{the introduction of}} biological control agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) has stimulated great interest for above and below-ground pests. However, despite promising laboratory and field trials, success with EPN in vegetables has rarely been achieved in field applications under practical conditions. Improvements in application technology for EPN that aim at minimizing losses during the transfer from the mixing tank to the target insect, increasing the competitiveness of EPN, are badly needed. Twenty years ago, the effect of application technology on EPN was underestimated. Laboratory experiments investigated the possible detrimental effects of application equipment and resulted in some rules of thumb, e. g., considering spray liquid temperature, nozzle size and pressure. Numerous succeeding studies, however, indicated that those restrictions do not prevent nematode damage. The general objective of this thesis was, therefore, to systematically screen all steps of the spray application process, from spray tank to nematode deposition, for possible detrimental or efficacy reducing effects on EPN applied in vegetables. Research started with a literature review {{on the effects of}} application technique on EPN, and on the characteristics of three important vegetable pests (cabbage <b>maggot,</b> <b>onion</b> thrips and cabbage moth) and their control with EPN. Experiments were designed to investigate two important processes of the spray system, i. e., agitation and spray formation. More practical oriented experiments were performed to study the effect of the spray application technique on nematode deposition. Finally, the effect of spray volume on nematode deposition, viability and infectivity was studied. For the application of EPN, a good agitation system is indispensable as the nematodes tend to sediment fast in a spray tank without agitation. Three agitation systems, viz. mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic agitation were tested for their ability to keep the nematodes suspended. Hydraulic agitation was tested using a centrifugal and a diaphragm pump. Nematode damage was quantified based on viability and infectivity of the EPN. Mechanical agitation at a speed of approximately 696 revolutions min- 1 did not influence the viability nor the infectivity of the nematodes. Also pneumatic agitation during 120 min was not detrimental to the EPN. Viability, nor infectivity were affected. However, the effect of hydraulic agitation differed depending on the pump type used. Hydraulic agitation using the diaphragm pump did not harm the nematodes, whereas the use of the centrifugal pump clearly affected viability. After 120 minutes of recirculation, only 19. 3 % of the nematodes survived; infectivity was even reduced to 0 %. An additional experiment revealed that the temperature increase, from 21. 7 °C to 45. 4 °C, was responsible for the observed nematode damage. The ability of the agitation system to keep the nematodes in suspension was examined by comparing the nematode concentration observed in the samples taken at different agitation times. These measurements showed that the pneumatic agitation was unstable. Agitation during 120 minutes using the other agitation systems resulted in a significant loss of nematodes at 15 cm above the spray tank bottom. In general, the experiments prove that the agitation systems developed to agitate a chemical solution are not always suited to agitate a nematode suspension and can attribute to reduced efficacy of EPN. One of the major considerations related to the selection and use of an application system is the application distribution pattern. A completely uniform distribution of the nematodes in soil applications is not essential because the nematodes can move over short distances; however, uniform distribution is important in foliar EPN applications. The volumetric distribution pattern of EPN was tested beneath four nozzle types, i. e., a standard flat fan nozzle (TeeJet XR 110 08), an air induction flat fan nozzle (TeeJet AI 110 08), a drift reducing deflector type nozzle (TeeJet TT 110 08) and a TwinJet spray nozzle (TeeJet TJ 60 110 08). A comparison with the distribution of a chemical tracer (Brilliant Sulfo Flavine, BSF) was made to reveal possible distribution problems. A significant effect of nozzle type on the distribution of EPN beneath a spray nozzle was found. The differences between the nematode distribution and the distribution of the chemical tracer were negligible for the flat fan and the TwinJet nozzle. Small differences were measured for the air induction nozzle, while a remarkable difference in EPN-BSF distribution was found for the deflector nozzle. The nematode concentration shows a sharp peak {{in the center of the}} spray fan and declines much faster toward the edges as compared with the BSF concentration. Ideally, the distribution of EPN beneath the spray boom should be uniform. A theoretical calculation of the coefficient of variation of the nematode distribution beneath a spray boom was performed and showed that the spray overlap from a spray boom decreases differences in nematode distribution. An acceptable value for the coefficient of variation was found for all nozzles, except for the TwinJet nozzle where the coefficient of variation was slightly above 7 %. Effective control of insect pests using EPN requires more than a judicious choice of the nematode species. The biological agent must also be delivered in a way that enables the nematodes to infect the host. The optimization process needs to account for the particular requirements of the EPN species used, the target pest, and the crop. The effect of spray application equipment was studied on the deposition of EPN in five pest control applications, viz. cabbage maggot (Delia radicum) and cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in both cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda) and onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek (Allium porrum). The nematode deposition (number of nematodes) and spray pattern (distribution of EPN in the droplets) were compared after applying a nematode suspension using a 5 -nozzle spray boom equipped with flat fan (TeeJet XR 110 08), air induction flat fan (TeeJet AI 110 08) or TwinJet spray nozzles (TeeJet TJ 60 110 08). Two additional spray application systems, viz. air support and row application, were evaluated on their effectiveness to deliver nematodes to their target site. Deposition of Steinernema feltiae was observed in the leek shaft (habitat of onion thrips) and at the cauliflower and savoy cabbage foot (habitat of cabbage maggot), while the deposition of S. carpocapsae was measured at the underside of cauliflower and savoy cabbage leaves (habitat of cabbage moth). Control measurements were performed using Petri dishes filled with water. Empty Petri dishes were used after spraying to measure the spray pattern. The cabbage plants were young but their foliage already sheltered the nematode spray significantly; approximately 40 % of the applied nematodes did not reach the foot of the plants. Changing nozzle type did not affect the deposition results, except for the TwinJet nozzle. A spray boom equipped with these dual fan nozzles delivered significantly fewer EPN at the foot of the cauliflower as compared with the flat fan nozzle. The use of an air support system or a row application system improved nematode deposition at the foot of the savoy cabbage. These systems, however, did not significantly increase deposition at the cauliflower foot. With the standard boom spray application technique, relative nematode deposition on the bottom side of the savoy cabbage leaves was 27. 2 %, while only 2. 6 % of the applied nematodes reached the bottom side of the cauliflower leaves. Neither nozzle type nor application technique affected nematode deposition at the bottom side of the savoy cabbage or cauliflower leaves. After spraying leek with a standard boom, a low nematode deposition was measured in the leek shaft. With this technique, only 7. 3 EPN cm- 2 reached the transition zone in the leek shaft. Changing nozzle type or using the air support system did not significantly increase nematode deposition in the leek shaft. Overall, no differences in nematode deposition were found on Petri dishes at different sampling positions along the spray boom, thus an even nematode distribution was obtained underneath the 5 -nozzle spray boom. Relative deposition on the horizontal Petri dishes, calculated based on the theoretical maximum deposition, was significantly higher for the air induction nozzle as compared to the flat fan nozzle for both nematode species. Nozzle type also affected the spray pattern of nematodes. The Petri dish surface covered with nematode containing droplets was very low and varied from 13. 6 % (flat fan nozzle) to 15. 8 % (air induction nozzle). The experiments provide evidence that EPN frequently do not reach their target sites using standard application techniques. Moreover, the nematodes reaching their target are applied in droplets that cover only a small part of the treated surface. The use of adapted spray application techniques that direct the spray to the target site are indispensable to increase chances for contact of EPN with their target and to result in a cost-effective and reliable application. Spray volume can influence the amount of free water on the leaf surface and subsequently the ability for EPN to move. Therefore, the effect of spray volume, viz. 548, 730 and 1095 L ha- 1, was investigated on the deposition, viability and infectivity of EPN against Galleria mellonella on savoy cabbage, cauliflower and leek. Leaf disks and filter paper disks, placed at different angles to the spray nozzle, were exposed to a nematode spray. Increasing spray volume decreased nematode deposition on top of 7. 1 cm² leek leaf disks in a 15 ° angle with the spray nozzle. Although the number of living nematodes observed after 240 min of incubation (24 °C and 60 % RH) was not significantly different between the low and the high volume application, a greater infectivity was obtained in the latter application. No significant effect of spray volume was observed on the relative deposition of S. carpocapsae on the bottom side of cauliflower and savoy cabbage leaf disks. Despite the low S. carpocapsae deposition on the bottom side of the savoy cabbage disks, high infectivity was obtained against G. mellonella. Using the lowest spray volume, infectivity decreased with increasing exposure time, while infectivity was not affected by exposure time when a spray volume of 730 L ha- 1 or more was used. Based on these experiments, spray volume can be considered as an important application parameter since it can affect nematode infectivity. The results of this research confirm that the technique used for the spray application can have severe efficacy reducing effects on EPN. These effects can be observed in the different steps of the application process and vary from nematode death, loss of nematodes and problems to keep the nematodes suspended in the spray tank to difficulties to reach the target pest and covering the target site evenly. The application of chemical insecticides is known to be very inefficient since only small amounts of the applied product reaches the insect, but eventually results in acceptable pest control due to the high persistence of the chemicals. Entomopathogenic nematodes, however, have low persistence on exposed surfaces and are currently too expensive to be applied in excessive amounts. More research is therefore badly needed to develop new or adjusted spray equipment or other application techniques which can deliver nematodes more efficiently at their target site in large field applications...|$|R

Spheres were hung about 18 inches from the ground and placed along onion field edges. We estimated that 45 to 60 % of the flies that visited a sphere were killed.   Based on fly visitation rates, we also predicted that one spinosad-baited sphere would kill approximately 182 flies (147 males and 36 females) during the onion-growing season. In 2007, we wanted to evaluate the performance of these spheres by assessing the level of protection they would provide to onion plants in commercial fields. Unfortunately, we did not observe a reduction in onion plant damage in field plots of onions where spinosad-baited spheres were placed.

Since its establishment in the United States and Canada, this insect is ever present and widely distributed, but the injuries vary in different localities and from year to year. Some fields suffer more than others, the attacks being both more frequent and more severe. During years of severe infestation, crops are often largely if not entirely destroyed. For in addition to the death of some of the plants, there {{is a certain amount of}} injury to the bulbs which makes them unfit for sale. Usually secondary infection, such as bacterial or fungous diseases sets in, which completes the havoc wrought by the maggots. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Summer-diapause and winter-diapause pupae of the <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia antiqua (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), were {{significantly}} more cold hardy than nondiapause, prediapause, and postdiapause pupae. Moreover, cold acclimation of nondiapause pupae conferred strong cold hardiness comparable with that of diapause pupae. Differential display analysis revealed that {{the expression of a}} gene encoding TCP- 1 (the t-complex polypeptide– 1), a subunit of chaperonin CCT, in D antiqua (DaTCP- 1) is upregulated in the pupae that express enhanced cold hardiness. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the levels of DaTCP- 1 messenger RNA in pupal tissues, brain, and midgut in particular, are highly correlated with the cold hardiness of the pupae. These findings suggest that the upregulation of DaTCP- 1 expression is related to enhanced cold hardiness in D antiqua. The upregulation of CCT in response to low temperature in an organism other than the yeast is newly reported...|$|E
40|$|Weather based pest {{forecast}} {{models are}} important tools for IPM implementation. The Network for Environmental and Weather Applications (NEWA) ([URL] provides forecasts for important pests {{of fruits and}} vegetables. A 2007 survey (Carroll et al.) of farmers using NEWA showed that use of pest forecasts saved an average $ 19, 500 in spray costs and prevented an average of $ 264, 000 in crop losses each year. The survey also found that vegetable growers comprised only 30 % of users, a level we hope to increase through this project. We will update the NEWA vegetable models to improve the user interface and incorporate forecast weather. We will also investigate new vegetable models that could be added to NEWA. To date, have updated the models for late blight, a serious pest of potato and tomato, the degree-day model for cabbage maggot, a pest of multiple crucifer crops, the <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> and disease models and {{are in the process}} of updating the tomato and potato disease models.

40|$|After having {{reviewed}} the international {{history of the}} genus Allium and the economic importance of the onion crop in the Netherlands the author described and compared the situations before and after a 12 years' period (1939 - 1951) of research on onions and shallots. In this period research was started on practical problems on choice of variety, manuring, cultural methods, control of diseases, and storage. This period of 12 years saw an increase in productivity of 6 % of the onion selections, an economy of N fertilizer and a yield increase of 2. 5 % by correct rates of N. Labour and seed were saved and crop care was better by sowing in rows instead of broadcast. There was much less infestation by yellow dwarf of the onion seed crop and shallot crop and <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> was under control. Storage losses were limited by preventing frost injury. Growing of onions from sets was entirely a result of research. Finally prospects were outlined on choice of variety, mechanization and storage. Future activities of the Netherlands Onion Federation were forecast. <p/...|$|E
40|$|Winter-diapause and cold-acclimated non-diapause pupae of the <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia antiqua (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), show strong cold hardiness. To obtain {{insights}} into the mechanisms involved in the enhancement of cold hardiness, we investigated the expression patterns of genes encoding subunits of chaperonin (CCT) and the morphology of actin, a substrate of CCT, at low temperatures. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed the mRNA levels of CCT subunits in pupal tissues to be highly correlated with the cold hardiness of the pupae. While actin in the Malpighian tubules of non-cold-hardy pupae showed extensive depolymerization after a cold treatment, actin in the same tissue of cold-hardy pupae was not depolymerized. Damage to cell membranes became apparent after the depolymerization of actin. Moreover, administration of Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, to the larvae markedly decreased the cold hardiness of the pupae obtained. These findings suggest that CCT contributes to the cold hardiness of D. antiqua through the repression of depolymerization of actin at low temperatures.

40|$|Glutathione Stransferase (GST) {{is a kind}} of detoxifying enzymes widely {{existing}} in insects. Its peroxidase vitality can protect the organisms against endogenous or oxide damage. The insect resistance to some pesticides is relative to the expression quantity of GST, and past research of insect GST mainly focused on the important role in the formation of pesticides resistance. This kind of genes can be used as the target of insecticide to design and develop new pesticides. In this research, the full length of GST cDNA of the <b>onion</b> <b>maggot</b> (Delia antiqua) was cloned using RACE technique (GenBank access number: JQ 625502).

40|$|The <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia antiqua, is a {{worldwide}} subterranean pest and can enter diapause {{during the summer}} and winter seasons. The molecular regulation of the ontogenesis transition remains largely unknown. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify candidate genes and processes linked to summer diapause (SD) induction by comparing the transcriptome differences between the most sensitive larval developmental stage of SD and nondiapause (ND). Nine pairwise comparisons were performed, and significantly differentially regulated transcripts were identified. Several functional terms related to lipid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism, environmental adaption, immune response, and aging were enriched during the most sensitive SD induction period. A subset of genes, including circadian clock genes, were expressed differentially under diapause induction conditions, and there was much more variation in the most sensitive period of ND- than SD-destined larvae. These expression variations probably resulted in a deep restructuring of metabolic pathways. Potential regulatory elements of SD induction including genes related to lipid, carbohydrate, energy metabolism, and environmental adaption. Collectively, our results suggest the circadian clock {{is one of the key}} drivers for integrating environmental signals into the SD induction. Our transcriptome analysis provides insight into the fundamental role of the circadian clock in SD induction in this important model insect species, and contributes to the in-depth elucidation of the molecular regulation mechanism of insect diapause induction...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} susceptibility of larvae and adults of the <b>onion</b> <b>maggot,</b> Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Muscidae: Anthomyiidae) to 27 isolates of entomopathogenic fungi from four genera [Beauveria Vuillemin, Lecanicillium (Petch) Zare & W. Gams, Metarhizium Sorokin, and Paecilomyces Bainier]. A novel bioassay was developed for D. antiqua larvae by using a diet based on mixed vegetable powder. When evaluated in a virulence screen, the fungal isolates caused less mortality of D. antiqua larvae than adults. Only three isolates caused > 50 % mortality of larvae, whereas 12 isolates caused > 50 % mortality of adults. Fungal species was a statistically significant factor affecting the mortality of larvae but not of adults. The fungal isolates causing the most mortality of larvae tended to belong to Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin. Two M. anisopliae isolates (389. 93 and 392. 93) were evaluated in dose-response bioassays. The median lethal concentrations of the isolates against larvae were 6. 1 X 10 (7) conidia ml(- 1) for isolate 389. 93 and 7. 6 X 10 (7) conidia ml(- 1) for isolate 392. 93. The emergence of adult flies from pupae was reduced at high concentrations of conidia (3. 0 X 10 (8) and 1. 0 X 10 (8) conidia ml(- 1)). The median lethal concentrations of the isolates against adults were 1. 7 X 10 (7) and 4. 0 X 10 (7) conidia ml(- 1), respectively. Some of the fungal isolates examined may have potential as biological control agents of larvae of D. antiqua and related species...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intraspecific}} and interspecific competition, host plant, and prior host plant experience on fecundity, rate of oviposition and mortality of adults and larval survival of Delia radicum Bouche (Cabbage Maggot (CM)), D. antiqua Meigen (<b>Onion</b> <b>Maggot</b> (OM)), and D. platura Meigen (Seed Corn Maggot (SCM)), were studied on cabbage, onion and bean plants. An optimum density for maximum fecundity per female was observed when the four experimental densities were compared. This optimum density was higher on host than on non-host plants. CM females were host specific {{and did not}} oviposit on non-host plants. Rates of oviposition and mortality over a 30 -day period were calculated for each density. The rate of oviposition was slower at higher densities on host plants for CM, OM and SCM. The rate of mortality increased at the highest density for CM (cabbage), OM (bean) and SCM (cabbage), but remained unaffected for OM on onion and cabbage and for SCM on onion and bean, when densities were compared. For OM, a delay {{in the rate of}} oviposition and mortality on cabbage (non-host plant) when compared with onion (host plant), suggests that cabbage was not as readily accepted as an oviposition site. Interspecific competition experiments at six density ratio's of SCM:OM indicated increased fecundity, or an increase in the rate of oviposition for OM, at the lower densities when single and mixed species were compared. For SCM no effects on fecundity were recorded, but the rate of oviposition was slower and rate of mortality faster at the lowest density in the presence of OM. Similar studies with SCM and CM showed no such effects of competition. Host plant exposure of SCM females during the pre-oviposition period resulted in a delay in initial acceptance of subsequent host plants as oviposition sites. This happened only when females were exposed to a secondary host during the pre-oviposition period. Once oviposition began, host discrimination ceased and a switch in oviposition sites to the preferred host did not alter the rate of oviposition. In CM, the rate of larval development increased at density 6 (optimum density). Above this density a decrease in the rate of development and a significant reduction in pupal weight was observed. Time required for fly emergence was not affected by increasing larval densities...|$|E
