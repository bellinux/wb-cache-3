40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{knowledge}} compilation is to transform programs {{in order to}} speed up their evaluation. In Inductive Logic Programming, two major approaches to speed-up learning exist: Approaches that intertwine the learning and the optimization process and approaches that separate these two processes. We follow the latter approach and present a new equivalence-preserving transformation method for programs with <b>ordered</b> <b>clauses.</b> It eliminates redundancies that make forward inference procedures slow. We introduce general chain rules, a specific class of <b>ordered</b> <b>clauses,</b> whose syntactical features are exploited in a new forward inference method. The comparison of the time needed by this method to evaluate the transformed program with the time needed by a standard forward inference procedure for the original program confirms the expected speed-up...|$|R

The central idea behind these projects is to apply techniques and concepts developed for theorem proving in disjunctive logic programming (thereby achieving a tight integration between these two paradigms) and apply this combination to real world problems such as information management systems. The theorem prover PROTEIN developed {{as a result of}} the deduction project is being extended to include features, such as minimal model reasoning, that are required for disjunctive logic programming. In the sequel, we briefly review this idea. Interested readers are referred to our full papers (see the references) for more information on the presented materials.

The rules associated with propositional logic programs and the stable semantics are not expres-sive enough to let one write concise optimization programs.

In earlier work we dened the declarative semantics for partial <b>order</b> <b>clauses.</b> The main contribution of our paper is the following: First, we dene the language of our extended paradigm as well as its declarative semantics. Our declarative semantics is based on translating partial <b>order</b> <b>clauses</b> into normal programs and the using the stable semantics as the intended meaning of the original program. Second, we propose an operational semantics for our paradigm.

We present several complete versions of highly restricted theory model elimination (TME) calculi. These restrictions allow (1) to keep fewer path literals in extension steps than in related calculi, and (2) to discard proof attempts with multiple occurrences of literals along a path (i. e. regularity holds). On the other hand, we obtain by small modifications to TME versions {{which do not}} need contrapositives (a la Near-Horn Prolog). We show how regularity can be adapted for these versions. The independence of the goal computation rule holds for all variants.

40|$|Most of the Canadian plains {{region is}} covered by the 2 ̆ 2 Numbered Treaties 2 ̆ 2 {{negotiated}} in the 1870 s between {{the government of the}} Dominion of Canada, acting for the British Crown, and the nations whose territories encompassed the area. Even {{at the time that the}} treaties were negotiated, the various signatories had different assumptions about what they actually meant. During the ensuing century and more that the treaties have existed, their meanings have been reinterpreted. With the repatriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, giving treaty rights constitutional status and protection from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the actual guarantees of the treaties have often been interpreted in a manner inconsistent with current government policy and quite possibly in a way that none of the treaty negotiators for the Crown could have imagined, let alone predicted, in the 1870 s. Although the Crown 2 ̆ 7 s prime objective was to avoid American-style 2 ̆ 2 Indian wars 2 ̆ 2 by securing promises of peace from the First Nations 2 ̆ 7 leaders and to negotiate the surrender of lands that could then be parceled out to incoming Euro-Canadian settlers, the texts of the treaties did promise the Indigenous parties sovereignty on their remaining territory, and particularly in the case of Treaty Seven, established that Indigenous leaders should share the responsibility for maintaining peace and order in the region. While it is always difficult to interpret a document in the light of completely altered circumstances, I make the argument that Treaty Seven, at least, may be legitimately interpreted in such a way as to provide for guaranteed representation, at the federal level, for the First Nations that were parties to the treaty. Although a number of studies have been conducted during the past several years suggesting that guaranteed parliamentary representation for Aboriginal peoples is compatible with the Canadian electoral system, others have suggested that such particularistic representation- giving special electoral rights to one particular group-is unconstitutional. The lack of consensus in the existing literature about the constitutionality of guaranteed Aboriginal representation may be because all of the studies have focused on integrating Aboriginal representation within the existing electoral scheme. Like Iris Marion Young, most scholars have conceptualized guaranteed representation as a means to rectify past injustices and inadequacies in the Canadian political system, but ihhey had examined guaranteed representation as a pre-existing right of Aboriginal peoples from before the repatriation of the constitution they might have arrived at different, more consistent conclusions. 1 In this paper I argue that guaranteed parliamentary representation can legitimately be derived from the peace and good <b>order</b> <b>clause</b> that appears in the Numbered Treaties. In Treaty Seven (as in all the Numbered Treaties) the peace and good order or 2 ̆ 2 mutual 2 ̆ 2 clause reads as follows: And the undersigned Blackfeet, Blood, Piegan [sic] and Sarcee Head Chiefs and Minor Chiefs, and Stony [sic] Chiefs and Councilors on their own behalf and on behalf of all other Indians inhabiting the Tract within ceded do hereby solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this Treaty, and also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects of Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that they will maintain peace and good order between each other and between themselves and other tribes of Indians, and between themselves and others of Her Majesty 2 ̆ 7 s subjects, whether Indians, Half Breeds or Whites, now inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit, any part of the said ceded tract; and that they will not molest the person or property of any inhabitant of such ceded tract, or the property of Her Majesty the Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person, passing or traveling through the said tract or any part thereof, and that they will assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to justice and punishment any Indian offending against the stipulation of this Treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the country so ceded. ...|$|E
