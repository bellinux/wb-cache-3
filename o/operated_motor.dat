5000|$|For {{several years}} prior to the closure of the tram system in 1931, the Corporation <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> buses {{concurrently}} with the trams. The first few buses were lettered [...] "Lowestoft Corporation Tramways", but as the fleet grew the lettering was changed to [...] "Lowestoft Corporation Transport".|$|E
50|$|The one-off bogie {{single deck}} car (no. 1089) {{was built in}} 1926 for {{evaluation}} on longer distance interurban routes where traffic was being lost to privately <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> buses. It was later used on the Duntocher service and for shipyard workers' extras. It is now preserved in the Riverside Museum.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 a {{subsidiary}} {{was formed to}} <b>operate</b> <b>motor</b> buses, which became increasingly important to the group as many municipalities were compulsorily acquiring company-owned tram networks in their areas.|$|R
50|$|Many {{drivers were}} <b>operating</b> <b>motor</b> {{vehicles}} {{that they may}} not have been trained or qualified to drive. This lack of training resulted in a large number of preventable traffic deaths and accidents.|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{switchgear}} {{was invented}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century for <b>operating</b> <b>motors</b> and other electric machines. The technology has been improved over time and can now be used with voltages up to 1,100 kV.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{with air}} {{operated}} brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping {{a small amount}} of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> mounted on or just above the windscreen. These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor.|$|E
50|$|Also in {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century the Alexandra Company <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> omnibus {{services}} within Newport Borough; it had the powers to do so as long as they did not compete with any municipal passenger tram route. Two 14-seat buses were acquired from the London and South Western Railway for the purpose. The arrangement lasted from 1906 to 1933.|$|E
50|$|The Benjamin Blacksmith Shop is a blacksmithy and museum, in {{operation}} since before 1885, located {{adjacent to the}} Biddle House on Market Street on Mackinac Island in the U.S. state of Michigan.

50|$|During the Second World War the Royal Dart Hotel became HMS Cicala and {{headquarters}} of the British 15th Destroyer Flotilla. Journeys were made {{from there to the}} northern beaches of Brittany, landing agents and equipment for the French Resistance and bringing back escaping allied soldiers and airmen. The Free French Navy <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> launches and motor torpedo boats from Kingswear and was based in Brookhill, a large house dating from about 1820 {{on the outskirts of the}} village.|$|E
50|$|The single {{molecule}} {{electric motor}} is an electrically <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> {{which is made}} from a single butyl methyl sulphide molecule. The molecule is adsorbed onto a Copper (111) single crystal piece by chemisorption. The motor, the world's smallest electric motor, is just a nanometer (billionth of a meter) across (60,000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair). It was developed by chemists at the Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences and published online September 4, 2011.|$|E

This patent is the precursor to all modern computer controlled scenery systems. Patent #2,463,463 Lighting Control Circuits, perhaps Izenour's best known invention, is a patent for a compact remote operation system for theatrical and television lighting dimming systems. This patent {{is the basis for}} all modern lighting control consoles. Izenour also developed such varied technologies as articulated acoustical sub-structures and assorted analogue and digital control systems.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 April 1856 Miss Seymour, {{sister of}} the company’s chairman, dug the first {{ceremonial}} sod for the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR) at Gillingham. Three years later, on 2 May 1859, the railway from [...] opened to Gillingham, and was completed to [...] station at Yeovil on 1 June 1860. The station {{was close to the}} town centre. The main offices and goods shed were {{on the north side of}} the line, further sidings to serve a brickworks were added on the other side of the line, and a signal box opened in 1875. Trains were provided for the S&YR by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), which bought out the smaller company in 1878. In the twentieth century the LSWR <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> bus services from Gillingham station to Mere, Zeals and Shaftesbury.|$|E
50|$|Freight traffic {{started on}} 15 April 1910, {{passenger}} traffic on 1 May 1910. The latter was never very brisk, despite Grund being a health resort and having been awarded the title Bad in 1916. A {{reason for this}} was the unfavourable placement of the passenger station south of the town. Starting on 19 May 1930, the railway company <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> buses between Bad Grund and Gittelde and even the next junction station in Seesen. While there had been five passenger trains per day and direction {{in the first years}} of the operation of the railway, this number fell to one after 1930, and on 22 May 1966 passenger traffic was taken over completely by buses. When the ore transports were taken over by lorries, the line was closed down on 30 December 1971. The railway company operated in the last years as Eisenbahn Gittelde-Bad Grund GmbH. It was dissolved on 30 September 1974.|$|E

5000|$|During the Second World War, as {{had been}} the case during the First World War, the units posted to Bermuda to provide the regular {{infantry}} company on garrison included reserve units from the Canadian Army (as the Canadian Militia had been renamed in 1940), embodied {{for the duration of}} the war. At the start of the war a company of the 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry was on deployment to Bermuda. They were succeeded by the Canadian Army's Winnipeg Grenadiers in 1940, a company of the 4th Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders (including future Major Donald Henry [...] "Bob" [...] Burns, MC, who would be a Second-in-Command of the Bermuda Regiment, Town Crier of St. George's, and Guinness world record holder for loudest human speaking voice) in 1942, and a company of the Canadian Pictou Highlanders from 1942 to 1946. [...] As during the First World War, the part-time units were again mobilized for the duration, becoming full-time. Conscription was quickly introduced, with all military-age British males resident in Bermuda liable for service. The regular army infantry company operated the headquarters of the Garrison at Prospect Camp, and took responsibility for patrolling and guarding in the central parishes. The BVRC took responsibility for patrolling and defending the East End of Bermuda, and the BMI for the West End. In addition to maintaining guards at the Dockyard and Darrell's Island, the infantry soldiers guarded the trans-Atlantic cable facilities, beaches and inlets, patrolled the island, and <b>operated</b> <b>motor</b> boat patrols.|$|E
50|$|From 1920 the Corporation also <b>{{operated}}</b> <b>motor</b> buses on routes {{beyond the}} tram tracks. The first four bus routes were {{operated by a}} fleet of twenty single-deck 31-seat vehicles with solid tyres. By 1927 this had expanded to ten routes and 57 buses, {{some of which were}} one-man operated. Plymouth was granted city status in 1928 and the buses started to carry the city's coat of arms and the 'Plymouth City Transport' name. By 1930 it was becoming necessary to renew much of the tramway rolling stock. Consideration was given to converting to trolleybuses, but instead it was decided to implement a ten-year programme of bus replacement. The first line to be converted was the Devonport to St Budeaux line which was closed in October 1930 when six new double-deck buses replaced the trams. The line to West Hoe closed in 1931, the line to Compton closed in 1932, and regular services to the Royal Naval Barracks withdrawn in 1934. Further new buses were brought for these routes, and a few second hand tramcars from the now closed Exeter Tramway Company and Torquay Tramways allowed the oldest of the Plymouth cars to be withdrawn. In 1935 the Milehouse to Devonport line closed following the delivery of the city's first diesel-engined buses. More were needed in 1936 to allow the closure of the line to Prince Rock and in 1937 to allow the withdrawal of the two long circular routes. It was at this time that the bus routes were first numbered. The plan to close the remaining tram lines was put on hold because of the outbreak of World War II in 1939; they were powered by electricity generated by British coal, whereas the buses relied on imported fuel. The one remaining route, from Theatre to Peverell, kept running but following city centre bomb damage in April 1941 (when car 133 was destroyed) the service was only operated between Drake's Circus to Peverell until the final tram ran in September 1945.|$|E
