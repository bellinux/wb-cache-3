Unlike prior approaches, which are mainly based on continuous sound signals from a stationary source, our formulation {{is designed to}} localize the position instantaneously from signals within a single frame. We consider direct sound and indirect sound signals that reach the microphones after reflecting off surfaces such as ceilings or walls. We then generate and trace direct and reflected acoustic paths using inverse acoustic ray tracing and utilize these paths with Monte Carlo localization to estimate a 3 D sound source position. We have implemented our method on a robot with a cube-shaped microphone array and tested it against different settings with continuous and intermittent sound signals with a stationary or a mobile source. Across different settings, our approach can localize the sound with an average distance error of 0. 8 m tested in a room of 7 m by 7 m area with 3 m height, including a mobile and non-line-of-sight sound source. We also reveal that the modeling of <b>indirect</b> <b>rays</b> increases the localization accuracy by 40 % compared to only using direct acoustic rays. Comment: Submitted to ICRA 2018.

The new model can now account for the increase in flux at low lineal energy when the ions are of very high energy. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated results and available data for laboratory ion beams.

40|$|An {{improved}} prediction {{for space}} radiations {{in the lower}} earth orbits measured by the shuttle TEPC is obtained when energy loss straggling and chord length distribution of the detector are considered. A generalized analytic model is {{used to describe the}} energy deposition of direct ion interaction events in a micron-size detector. The transport calculation accounting for the shuttle configuration is accomplished by using a new version of HZETRN that has been extensively verified with laboratory and flight data. The agreement of predicted and measured lineal energy spectra is within 70 % for the region above 2 keV/micrometer but within a factor of 2. 3 underpredicted for the region below this value. The inclusion of <b>indirect</b> delta <b>ray</b> events in the model is needed before possible causes for the underprediction below 2 keV/micrometer can be assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{consider}} the phenomenology of the scalar singlet model of dark matter in light of current experimental and observational results. Signals of the model from direct detection methods, indirect detection methods and from collider searches are all computed. Direct nuclear recoil signals are calculated and compared with current experimental bounds. <b>Indirect</b> cosmic <b>ray</b> annihilation signals {{in the form of}} gamma rays, positrons, antiprotons and antideuterons are examined and the possibility of detecting a measurable signal is considered. A neutrino signal from the annihilation of singlet dark matter gravitationally captured in massive bodies is also computed. Finally, the production and detection of scalar singlet dark matter in particle colliders like the LHC is considered. It is found that the scalar singlet model is favored by current nuclear recoil experiments and consistent with current indirect detection bounds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The CODALEMA experiment, {{located at}} the Nançay Radio Astronomy Facility in France, is an {{instrument}} dedicated to <b>indirect</b> cosmic <b>ray</b> detection through the radio emission induced the by charged particles of Extensive Air Showers (EAS). Taking data steadily since several years, different setups of the experiment have allowed great improvements on {{the understanding of the}} radio emission mechanisms and their links with the properties of the primary cosmic ray. The antennas of the latest CODALEMA setup have been designed in order to be more sensitive to the fast radio-transients coming from EAS, in both horizontal polarizations of the electric field. Furthermore, the expansion of the array up to one square kilometer will boost the statistics around 0. 1 EeV and allow a more accurate description of the radio lateral profile, which is expected to be linked to the primary cosmic ray energy and composition. Selected results concerning methods for rejection of background transients and the first radio-detected cosmic ray data set will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|A rapid {{analytical}} procedure for {{the prediction of}} a micro-dosimeter response function in low Earth orbit (LEO), correlated with the Space Transportation System (STS, shuttle) Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) measurements is presented. The analytical model takes into consideration the energy loss straggling and chord length distribution of the detector, and is capable of predicting energy deposition fluctuations in a cylindrical micro-volume of arbitrary aspect ratio (height/diameter) by incoming ions through both direct and <b>indirect</b> (<b>ray)</b> events. At any designated (ray traced) target point within the vehicle, the model accepts the differential flux spectrum of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and/or trapped protons at LEO as input. On a desktop PC, the response function of TEPC for each ion in the GCR/trapped field is computed at the average rate of 30 seconds/ion. The ionizing radiation environment at LEO is represented by O'Neill fs GCR model (2004), covering charged particles in the 1 {{less than or equal}} to Z {{less than or equal to}} 28. O'Neill's free space GCR model is coupled with the Langley Research Center (LaRC) angular dependent geomagnetic cutoff model to compute the transmission coefficient in LEO. The trapped proton environment is represented by a LaRC developed time dependent procedure which couples the AP 8 MIN/AP 8 MAX, Deep River Neutron Monitor (DRNM) and F 10. 7 solar radio frequency measurements. The albedo neutron environment is represented by the extrapolation of the Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) measurements. The charged particle transport calculations correlated with STS 51 and 114 flights are accomplished by using the most recent version (2005) of the LaRC deterministic High charge (Z) and Energy TRaNsport (HZETRN) code. We present the correlations between the TEPC model predictions (response function) and TEPC measured differential/integral spectra in the lineal energy (y) domain for both GCR and trapped protons, with the conclusion that the model correctly accounts for the increase in flux at low y values where energetic ions are the primary contributor. We further discuss that, even with the incorporation of angular dependency in the cutoffs, comparison of the GCR differential/integral flux between STS 51 and 114 TEPC measured data and current calculations indicates that there still exists an underestimation by the simulations at low to mid range y values. This underestimation is partly related the exclusion of the secondary pion particle production from the current version of HZETRN...|$|R
50|$|Rondal and Cession {{tested the}} {{viability}} of the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis by observing the speech of 18 monolingual English speaking mothers to their normally developing children age 1 to 2 years old. In this experiment, investigators tape-recorded two half-hour sessions of mother-child verbal interactions. Child-directed utterances were extracted and coded for the 16 dependent variables below. These included the semantic categories, grammatical function categories, and part of speech categories. The semantic bootstrapping hypothesis states that a child uses semantic categories to infer grammatical categories. For example, action words (Dependent variable) indicate a verb (Categories), and the names of things (Dependent variable) indicate a noun (Categories). The focus of the experiment was to find out whether the grammatical and semantic categories and relations were correlated in the speech children heard. If they were, then that would indicate the plausibility of the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis. The major findings of the experiment show that in terms of grammatical function categories, agents of actions were associated to subjects of the sentence, patients and themes as objects, and goals, locations and instruments as <b>oblique</b> or <b>indirect</b> objects. Rondal and Cession suggested that the input evidence assists children to identify those grammatical function categories by using thematic relations (agent, patient, etc.). They found that semantic notions reliably correlate with specific syntactic elements in parental speech and this may support the child’s construction of grammatical categories. Hence, the results of this experiment point to the soundness of the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{evidence}} that both pollinators and nonpollinator agents of selection can shape {{the evolution of}} floral characters, {{there have been few}} attempts to compare the strengths and directions of selection from pollinators and other agents in the same study system. In this investigation of Leucanthemum vulgare, a self-incompatible composite known for its conspicuous white rays, I obtained data from a ray removal experiment in the field and from a segregating F 2 population in an experimental garden to assess the role of pollinator and nonpollinator selection as stabilizing factors on floral evolution in this species. Removal of all rays reduced the pollination success of heads by 31 – 35 %, but did not significantly affect the level of infestation by larvae of the fly Tephritis neesii. Data from F 2 plants indicated a potential for <b>indirect</b> selection on <b>ray</b> morphology, mediated through links between ray morphology and measures of vegetative size and plant vigor. The results of this study show that individuals of the normal, rayed phenotype have a clear selective advantage, in terms of both pollinator attraction and general plant vigor. Thus, there were no conflicting selection pressures between the pollinators and the other selective agents considered in this study...|$|R
40|$|Background: Indirect {{inguinal}} hernias {{are usually}} congenital, forming a sac {{in the core}} of the spermatic cord covered by the internal spermatic, cremasteric, and external spermatic fasciae 1 − 3. Direct inguinal hernias are acquired; the sac lies beside/behind the cord 1 − 3. A rare third type is a combination of indirect and direct sacs on both sides of inferior epigastric vessels 1 − 3. We describe a rare fourth type, juxtacordal <b>indirect</b> <b>oblique</b> inguinal hernia (Fig. 1), in which the sac emerges through a weakness in the deep inguinal ring, lateral to inferior epigastric vessels, and passes into the inguinal canal beside and in contact with the cord but outside of its covering fasciae. Objective: Describes a very rare variety of inguinal hernia. Design: Case reports. Setting: Tikrit Teaching Hospital/Salahuddin/Iraq. Participants: and presentation: The first case; a 5 -year-old male with right inguinal hernia, the second case; a 25 -year-old man with right inguinal hernia, the third case; a 60 -year-old man with right inguinal hernia. Interventions: Surgery has been done electively for all. Results and discussion: Because the sac emerges through the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal, it is an indirect type and because it passes beside the spermatic cord we call it juxtacordal hernia. Because of the thick extraperitoneal fat layer over the sac, we think this hernia is acquired. Conclusions: Knowing this type of hernia might reduce the risk of inferior epigastric vessels injury and lower the rate of recurrence...|$|R
