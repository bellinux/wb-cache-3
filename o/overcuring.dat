40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an experimental study on changes of various mechanical 	properties especially in corrosion atmosphere, appearance of fracture, 	breaking state, changes of physical quantities, etc. regarding the curing process 	as the compositizing properties. 	As {{a result of}} this series of tests and experiments, it was found that a good 	composite body from the view points of properties, productivity and economy 	can be made through curing temperature of 70 °C and curing time of 1 hore. 	With regard to compositizing properties, over-curing was better and on the 	safer side than under-curing, but <b>overcuring</b> beyond the pertinent curing conditions 	did not make a contribution to betterment of properties...|$|E
40|$|Mask Projection micro-Stereolithography (MPμSL) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique {{capable of producing}} solid parts with micron-scale resolution from a vat of photocurable liquid polymer resin. Although the physical mechanism remains the same, the process differs from traditional laser-galvanometer based stereolithography (SL) in its use of a dynamic mask UV projector, or digital light processor (DLP), which cures each location within each 3 D layer at the same time. One area where MPµSL has garnered considerable attention is {{in the field of}} microfluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip, where complex multistep microfabrication techniques adopted from the semiconductor industry are still widely used, and where MPµSL offers the ability to fabricate completely encapsulated fluidic channels in a single step and at low cost [1 – 3]. However, a significant obstacle exists in the prevention of channel blockage due to <b>overcuring</b> of the polymer resin [4, 5]. <b>Overcuring</b> {{can be attributed to the}} so-called ‘back side effect’ [2] which occurs during the build process as light from successive layers penetrates into the resin to a depth greater than the layer thickness. This effect is most prevalent in channels or features oriented horizontally (in a parallel plane to that of the build platform). Currently there are two main approaches in controlling the cure depth; 1. the chemical approach, which involves doping the resin material with a chemical light absorber [6 – 8]; and 2. by improving the system 2 ̆ 7 s hardware and optical elements to improve the homogeneity of the light dosage and control the cure depth [9]. Here we investigate a third approach through modification of the 3 D CAD file prior to printing to mitigate for UV light leakage from successive build layers. Although used here in conjunction with the MPμSL technique, this approach can be applied to a range of SL techniques to improve printer resolution and enable production of internal features with higher dimensional accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} transition reaction of the calcium silicate hydrate tobermorite into xonotlite under influence of additives. Tobermorite is the main binding agent in steam hardened building materials and the appearance of xonotlite indicates the progress of hardening and an <b>overcuring</b> of the material. Hydrothermal experiments under addition of sucrose, calcium formate and calcium chloride dihydrate to the main components quartz and lime were done using temperatures of 220 °C and a reaction time of 40. 5 h. All experiments were performed with powders as well as with pressed educts. The products of all syntheses were analyzed with XRD, SEM/EDX and FTIR. The references as well as the syntheses with calcium chloride dihydrate {{led to the formation of}} 11 Å tobermorite and xonotlite. The former showed the best results and even synthesis with pressed educts and calcium chloride dihydrate revealed an accelerating effect of the additive. In contrast syntheses with sucrose had the worst reactivity and led to the formation of calcite beside the CSH-phase scawtite. The additive calcium formate was only slightly oppressing the crystallization of tobermorite and favouring the formation of xonotlite. Syntheses with pressed pellets and sucrose or calcium formate showed generally worse results...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{solid state}} 13 C NMR, {{polybutadiene}} rubber vulcanizates were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. In the filled conventional system of BR vulcanizate accelerated with TBBS, {{addition to the}} olefinic double bond and substitution in the α position to the double bond occurred simultaneously. Also the latter α substitution reaction was faster than the former addition reaction at initial reaction time. In addition, {{it was suggested that}} double bond-addition-polysulfide structures might be modified into 5 -membered and 6 -membered cyclic structures in <b>overcure</b> time. These chain modifications were correlated with the decrease in the chemical crosslink density in <b>overcure</b> time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} curing a {{pneumatic}} tire {{as one of}} the most important working procedures, directly identify the quality of tire, because the physical and mechanical properties of rubber in the state of <b>overcure</b> or undercure are significantly decreased. The finite element analysis (FEA) method was introduced to evaluate the tire's state of cure (SOC) in this paper, and the optimization of cure conditions of giant radial tire was also referred to ensure that tire constituents achieved the proper SOC and improved the quality of tire. Results indicated that when the cure time was cut down 35 minutes by optimization process, most part of tire compound is appropriate cured. So that the energy cost was remarkable cut down and the productivity was rising in evidence...|$|R
3000|$|... μSLA {{has been}} {{developed}} for the fabrication of 3 D microstructures in a better resolution. This process employs a single photon beam that can be focused more precisely with a reduced spot size of laser. μSLA fabricates complex 3 D micro-scale structures with a layer thickness of less than 10  μm. In a PPF scaffold fabricated by the μSLA process (Lee et al. 2008), the rectangular pore sizes are 250 – 260  μm, and pores are interconnected in the three dominant directions. The mechanical properties of the PPE scaffold {{were similar to those}} of human trabecular bone. Similar work was also reported by Choi et al. (2009), who produced PPF-based 3 D scaffolds with interconnected pores of 100  μm in size using a scanning μSLA system. Although there are limitations associated with material shrinkage, <b>overcure</b> of the downward surface and the inability to remove uncured resin, this system plays a role in producing 3 D micro-scaffolds for tissue engineering.|$|R
