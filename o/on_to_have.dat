40|$|The {{economic}} theory of fertility choice builds predominantly on the unitary {{model of the}} household, {{in which there is}} a single household utility function and potential intra-household disagreement is abstracted from. Empirical evidence suggests, how-ever, that many (potential) mothers and fathers disagree <b>on</b> whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children, <b>on</b> how many children <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> and <b>on</b> when <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them. In this paper, we review existing work that brings models of intrahousehold conflict and bargaining <b>to</b> bear <b>on</b> fertility choice, and we point out promising future directions for this line of research.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the {{destroyed}} Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life {{until his death in}} 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara.

40|$|Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, {{this article}} investigates {{the role of}} attitudes, {{subjective}} norms and perceived behavioural control <b>on</b> intentions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child, comparing their effect <b>on</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child now with their effect <b>on</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child during the next three years. Data from Norway (N = 1307) show that subjective norms {{have a significant effect}} on the timing of intentions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child is supported by their families and friends, the more likely they are to want a child now compared to within the next three years. Attitudes also {{have a significant effect on}} differences in the timing of intentions, for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able <b>to</b> cope with <b>having</b> child are more likely <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child now rather than within the next three years. This effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of having a child varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R
