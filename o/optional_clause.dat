40|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} involve managing a set of <b>optional</b> <b>clauses.</b> For example, the soft clauses in a MAXSAT formula are optional—they can be falsified for a cost. Similarly, when computing a Minimum Correction Set for an unsatisfiable formula, all clauses are optional—some can be falsified {{in order to satisfy}} the remaining. In both of these cases the task is to find a subset of the <b>optional</b> <b>clauses</b> that achieves some criteria, and whose removal leaves a satisfiable formula. Relaxation search is a simple method of using a standard SAT solver to solve this task. Relaxation search is easy to implement, sometimes requiring only a simple modification of the variable selection heuristic in the SAT solver; it offers considerable flexibility and control over the order in which subsets of <b>optional</b> <b>clauses</b> are examined; and it automatically exploits clause learning to exchange information between the two phases of finding a suitable subset of <b>optional</b> <b>clauses</b> and checking if their removal yields satisfiability. We demonstrate how relaxation search can be used to solve MAXSAT and to compute Minimum Correction Sets. In both cases relaxation search is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance and solve some instances other solvers are not able to solve...|$|R

5000|$|Third, Article 36(2) allows {{states to}} make <b>optional</b> <b>clause</b> {{declarations}} accepting the Court's jurisdiction. The label [...] "compulsory" [...] sometimes placed on Article 36(2) jurisdiction is misleading since declarations by states are voluntary. Furthermore, many declarations contain reservations, such as exclusion from jurisdiction {{certain types of}} disputes ("ratione materia"). The principle of reciprocity may further limit jurisdiction. As of February 2011, sixty-six states had a declaration in force. Of the permanent Security Council members, only the United Kingdom has a declaration. In the Court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialized countries. Since the Nicaragua Case, declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the Court since the 1980s. Industrialized countries, however, have sometimes increased exclusions or removed their declarations in recent years. Examples include the United States, as mentioned previously, and Australia, which modified its declaration in 2002 to exclude disputes on maritime boundaries (most likely to prevent an impending challenge from East Timor, which gained their independence two months later).|$|E

Ratio ovih klauzula jest dati jednoj strani prednost pri biranju načina rješavanja sporova, i to nakon što je već došlo do spora, da na taj način olakša ostvarenje svojih potraživanja prema drugoj strani. U radu se analizira njihov položaj u anglosaksonskim jurisdikcijama, kao i odabrana sudska praksa država članica EU kontinentalnog pravnog kruga, gdje se sučeljava načelo stranačke autonomije s načelom ravnopravnosti stranaka.

Optional or {{unilateral}} arbitration clauses {{give the}} option to one contractual party to choose whether to commence proceedings before a national or arbitral court after the dispute between the parties has already arisen. The party with the option is at an advantage considering that choosing the more favorable dispute resolution method enhances her chances for a successful settlement. This article focuses on the basic features of optional or unilateral arbitration clauses and their position in comparative and domestic law. It analyses American and English court practice, as well as selected German and French cases. It finds that most EU Member States have a positive attitude towards <b>optional</b> arbitration <b>clauses.</b> The author emphasizes the position of German courts which invalidate these clauses if a party with the option wishes to utilize it after the other party has already commenced arbitral or judicial proceedings. Conversely, the author advocates {{the view that the}} Croatian courts should give advantage to party autonomy, where it recommends that parties provide for a special procedure when constructing <b>optional</b> arbitration <b>clauses.</b> This procedure should provide for communication between the parties before any proceedings are commenced in order to avoid parallel proceedings. Also, this article finds that, although <b>optional</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> are rare in the field of capital markets, the Croatian legislature has provided for obligatory use of this type of clauses for disputes between management companies and investors of UCITS funds. Finally, {{in spite of the fact}} that there have been no cases before the Croatian courts regarding the validity of <b>optional</b> arbitration <b>clauses,</b> the author is of the opinion that the Croatian courts would take a positive attitude towards these clauses...|$|R
