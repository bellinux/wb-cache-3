40|$|Wear in the hip {{prosthesis}} due to sliding contact {{as a product}} of human activity is a phenomenon which cannot be avoided. In general, there are two model of hip prostheses which are widely used in total hip replacement, i. e. unipolar and bipolar models. Wear in the bipolar model is more complex than the unipolar model due to its contact motion. The bipolar model has two contact mechanisms while the unipolar model has only one contact mechanism. It means that the bipolar model has two wear positions, i. e. wear on inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> surface. Fortunately, wear phenomena in the {{hip prosthesis}} can be predicted by analytical or numerical method. Wear on the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model itself can be early predicted by contact pressure distribution that is obtained from contact mechanic analysis. The contact pressure distribution itself is an essential variable in wear equations. This paper is aimed to studythe difference of the contact pressure distribution on the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model. To obtain the contact pressure distribution at each surface, contact mechanic analysis on the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> surface by analytical and numerical method were performed. Results showedthat there was significant difference of the contact pressure distribution on the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model. Therefore, it is expected that there is significant wear difference on the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> in the bipolar model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Through {{the set up}} of a {{calculation}} model on film cooling in the primary zone of an annular combustor, a parametrical study was made {{on the relationship of}} film cooling effectiveness and wall temperature with configuration parameters such as cooling slot height and TBC thickness. Through parametrical study, {{it can be seen that}} with all the parameters kept the same and even the resulting effectiveness of the <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> slightly greater due to a slightly higher blow ratio, the <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> temperatures are considerably higher than the inner liner temperatures. The calculation shows, with cooling effectiveness, there are optimum values of coolant injection angle and film cooling slot height, while there is a monotonous tendency for the relationship of cooling effectiveness with other parameters such as tapered angle on nugget lip, starting edge angle at nugget-slot exit and lip thickness. The study demonstrates that the higher the TBC thickness, the lower the highest value of base metal temperatures, but when the TBC thickens, it becomes heavier, and the possibility of TBC spallation gets greater...|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} {{and design of}} a package are key properties to attract and to focus {{the attention of a}} customer. Print quality contributes to a great degree to achieve these requirements. Most critical perceived in terms of quality are print defects like mottling, gloss and stripiness, which all appear in the printing of corrugated board. Stripiness is especially critical because it is a defect directly caused by the corrugated board construction. A further cause can be generated by the production process of corrugated board. Pre-studies by Odeberg Glasenapp (2004) revealed a difference in surface micro-roughness between the regions on the peak line of the liner and the regions in the valley between two peaks of the corrugation. This knowledge was the basis for the work described in this thesis. In a first stage, laboratory trials were conducted with sets of coated and uncoated samples of various grammages. The trial was set-up in order to simulate the conditions in the corrugator as closely as possible. In the evaluations, it was found out that the settings were too high. For that reason, the coated samples were influenced to a too high degree and needed to be excluded from further evaluations. With the uncoated samples, on the other hand, a change in micro surface roughness was detectable. The roughness is decreased on the peaks and the gloss appearance was the conclusion. The analysis of the printed samples focused on shifts in colour and print density. It is unclear if both are affected only surface roughness changes and/or by the typical corrugated board effect of washboarding. A full-scale test was performed in order to confirm the results of the laboratory test. A test series was chosen with coated and uncoated <b>outer</b> <b>liners.</b> Contrary to the lab-test results, the uncoated grades showed no surface roughness changes. Instead, the coated samples were affected to a great extent. The changes in surface roughness and gloss appearance were similar to the lab-test. This confirms that the lab-test samples were exposed to heat, pressure and shear to a too high degree. The print analysis of the full-scale test did not agree with the laboratory test. Gloss lines were visually detectable, but they were difficult to measure. A reason could be that the ink is capable on forming an ink film layer on top of the surface of the paper. This would cover the micro roughness of the matt parts thereby creating an almost homogeneous glossy appearance. QC 2010111...|$|R
40|$|This study {{suggests}} that contemporary modular acetabular shell designs employing ceramic liners deform during implantation where acetabular bed under-reaming is employed. The liner retention strength did not degrade by comparison to non-deformed shells using ASTM static push-out methods. A larger question, however, is the influence of this deformation on liner retention strength over time when both bone remodeling and cyclic activity occur. The idealization of component seating in the laboratory where surface contaminants, component position, and loading are controlled does not typify the operating room environment where liner seating is often an issue. Nevertheless, in this optimal situation, shell deformation was consistently observed as was striping on <b>outer</b> ceramic <b>liner</b> surfaces. Factors influencing the failure to seat components, as has been reported, need to be further documented. This study evaluates both metal banded and non-banded ceramic liners of like ceramic composition where a taper lock is utilized to achieve fixation. A further consideration, in this regard, may be the mismatch of shell-band stiffness where both CoCrMo and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V are employed. It {{is more likely that}} a CoCrMo band will diminish the possibility of any ceramic liner deformation because of its increased stiffness.

40|$|The RSRM 10 % Scaled Model under design {{will make}} use of drilled hole liners to provide mass {{addition}} along the axial length of the model. The model will have two sets of liners in use at a time. The <b>outer</b> most <b>liner</b> is a flow distribution tube, the purpose {{of which is to}} help distribute the flow evenly over each model segment. The inner most liner will simulate the propellant burning surface at a burn time of 80 seconds. This liner will replicate as closely as possible the actual geometry of the full scale RSRM at the 80 second burn time. In order to obtain the correct mass flow rate for the burn time selected, it is necessary to determine the porosity of the holes drilled in each liner and the performance of those holes. The pressure drop across the liners directly effects the uniformity of the flow in the axial direction for a given model section. It is desired to have a pressure drop across the liners which is greater than the axial pressure drop in a given section. However, the pressure drop across the liner also has a bearing on the structural soundness of the model. The performance of the model was determined analytically, but there was some uncertainty as to the value of the discharge coefficient used. This uncertainty was the impetus for these drilled hole plate tests. Experimentally obtaining the discharge coefficients for sample plates of the porosity {{to be used in the}} model would increase the fidelity of the model design.

This goal is achieved by exchanging flexible families of solutions rather than single point solutions, thereby reducing the need for iteration between scales. The effectiveness of the {{approach is}} illustrated by a two-level problem involving the system-level design of a gas turbine engine and the mesoscale design of cellular material for the combustor liner. A multi-objective design problem formulation is used to obtain families of prismatic cellular materials that embody a range of tradeoffs between conflicting thermal and structural performance objectives. The results are communicated to the system level and a solution is chosen to meet system-level goals as closely as possible. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated by comparison with a benchmark integrated design method.

40|$|Worldwide {{thousands}} of m 3 of highly active radioactive waste is being produced each year originating {{from the most}} diverse sources. The Belgian reference disposal concept is founded {{on the use of}} a concrete Sypercontainer deeply stored inside geological Clay layers. The container concept is based on a cylindrical multiple barrier system where the carbon steel heat-emitting waste canister is enclosed by a non-reinforced massive concrete buffer and an <b>outer</b> stainless steel <b>liner.</b> For the realization of the buffer two types of concrete are being tested and compared. In massive hardening concrete, the hydration heat has a considerable effect on the stress development inside the concrete structure due to the created therma gradients.

40|$|In {{the concept}} of the dynamic hohlraum an imploding z-pinch is {{optically}} thick to its own radiation. Radiation may be trapped inside the pinch to give a radiation temperature inside the pinch greater than that outside the pinch. The radiation is typically produced by colliding an outer Z-pinch liner onto an inner liner. The collision generates a strongly radiating shock, and the radiation is trapped by the <b>outer</b> <b>liner.</b> As the implosion continues after the collision the radiation temperature may continue to increase due to ongoing PdV (pressure times change in volume) work done by the implosion. In principal the radiation temperature may increase to {{the point at which the}} <b>outer</b> <b>liner</b> burns through, becomes optically thin, and no longer traps the radiation. One application of the dynamic hohlraum is to drive an ICF (inertial confinement fusion) pellet with the trapped radiation field. Members of the dynamic hohlraum team at Sandia National Labs have used the pulsed power driver Z (20 LMA, 100 ns) to create a dynamic hohlraum with temperature linearly ramping from 100 to 180 eV over 5 ns. On this shot zp 214 a nested tungsten wire array of 4 and 2 cm diameters with masses of 2 and 1 mg imploded onto a 2. 5 mg plastic annulus at 5 mm diameter. The current return can on this shot was slotted. It is likely the radiation temperature may be increased to over 200 CV by stabilizing the pinch with a solid current return can. A current return can with 9 slots imprints 9 filaments onto the imploding pinch. This degrades the optical trapping and the quality of the liner collision. A 1. 6 mm diameter capsule situated inside this dynamic hohlraum of zp 214 would see 15 kJ of radiation impinging on its surface before the pinch itself collapses to a 1. 6 mm diameter. Dynamic hohlraum shots including pellets are scheduled to take place on Z in September of 1998...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCreasing is {{a process}} which indents a section of {{corrugated}} board along fold lines to facilitate a neat fold. Most common failure site in a box made out of corrugated board is at the folds, where the stiffness is reduced by the creasing operation. Crease depth is an important parameter to be controlled. If the crease is too shallow, the section will crack during folding due to excessive strain on the <b>outer</b> <b>liner.</b> On the other hand, if the crease is too deep, the board may crack during the creasing operation itself or it may fail during handling due to excessive reduction in local strength along the fold line.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in nuclear engineering to use concrete as shielding material for nuclear facilities, thanks to its versatility, cheapness but also its capacity to absorb radiation, due to its intrinsic water content, namely hydrogen. The presence of this light-atomic weight element in the mixture of concrete is responsible for slowing down the produced neutrons, which is the reason why, in the nuclear field, concrete {{is referred to as}} a “biological” barrier. For gamma-rays shielding purposes, heavy elements are conceived of having good shielding properties, instead; therefore ordinary concrete mixtures are often enriched with heavy aggregates to ensure a good absorption of secondary radiation. Hence, the knowledge of the moisture content evolution with the work history of a nuclear facility is fundamental to ensure the maintenance of its biological shielding, which justifies the suggested thermo-hygro-mechanical approach for the durability assessment of a concrete radiation shielding, through a FEM research code developed in agreement with the theory of porous media, already implemented in its fundamental lines and upgraded to account for radiation damage effects on exposed concrete. The required damage law has been defined based on the enveloping curve of several empirical data describing the behaviour of the Young modulus of exposed specimens, with respect to that proper of blank samples, in function of the neutron fluence. The damage parameter is supposed to follow the isotropic damage theory. The main physical quantities, included realistic neutron fluence values for the design condition of a facility under study, have been defined through a Monte Carlo tool developed by CERN and INFN of Milan, able to handle 3 D radiation transport calculations in matter. The combined use of the Monte Carlo technique and the FEM code, upgraded {{to take into account the}} radiation exposure effects on concrete, has allowed us to identify in the thermal aspect, i. e. the temperature rise in the shielding due to radiation energy deposition, the most severe factor for prescribing a work scenario, for the nuclear facility under study, consistent with concrete durability, when no other protective device is present, such as <b>outer</b> metallic <b>liners</b> working as coats for the biological shield or the presence of a cooling systems of the walls...|$|R

A theoretical model for calculating the bearing forces and estimating the bearing moment characteristics is proposed. The calculated bearing forces are investigated in both time and frequency domains. The characteristics of the forces driving the piston across the cylinder clearance are calculated.
