50|$|Development of the estates {{started in}} the 17th century, when sawmills were {{established}} in the valley, and the first concepts of private <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> were established. The first sawmill was Grunnfoss Sag, established by Peder Juel in 1655, and included the rights from Ulvilla to Skjækerfossen. Peter Dreier received permission for the estates of Suul and Nybygget in 1683. Grunnfoss Sag was bought by Rasmus Ågeson Hagen in 1686, and started collecting the farms in the area. The name Værdalsgodset was taken into use for parts of the area in 1736. During the 1780s and 1790s, Johan Wideroe Tonning bought the farms Suul, Nybygget, Malså, Juldal and Væren estates. In 1807, Christen J. Müller, the owner of Vinje Gods in Mosvik, bought Tonning's estates and the Hagen family's estates (known as Vukugodset). After the estate filed for bankruptcy in 1819 during bad market conditions for the lumber industry, it was sold to Hilmar Meincke, who started using Holmen as the head office. The estate was again to do Nicolai Jenssen in 1832, who in 1845 rebuilt Holmen. He also built the first steam saw in Ørmelen in 1872.The Verdal Landslide on 19 May 1893 made shipping from Verdal impossible, resulting in a new sawmill being built in Levanger, which opened in 1902.|$|E

40|$|Abstract –The System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) views CO 2 {{sequestration}} as {{an ecosystem}} service, the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allocates CO 2 removals to forestry sectors. In effect, UNFCCC accounting provides {{the foundation for}} sequestered carbon to be owned and traded. Such ownership is not explicit in the SEEA. Moreover, interpretations of human inducement {{that are used to}} justify the classification of sequestered carbon as „anthropogenic ‟ differ substantially between the UNFCCC and the SEEA. Accounting dissonances and uncertain ownership rules can affect industry perspectives on their operations. Global markets for carbon from forests are still small, but with increasing pressure for abatement measures and increasing demand for forest space, problems surrounding the accounting for human-induced change, customary <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests,</b> and the allocation of property rights are likely to hamper the transition of carbon from collectively owned ecosystem input to individually owned commodity...|$|E

A scale-extended latent class model was used to analyse preference heterogeneity in data of 323 smallholders from three different regions in Indonesia (West Kalimantan, Yogyakarta, and South Sumatera). These regions are at different forest transition stages. Our results indicate that there are four latent preference classes, which value attributes of the contract differently. Individual characteristics (risk orientation, tree growing experiences, andoccupation), and regional differences explain the probability of preference class membership.

40|$|Deforestation {{has been}} a complex {{phenomenon}} to study in sub-Saharan Africa. The average annual deforestation rate {{in the region is}} by far higher than the world average. What causes and drives deforestation in the region are debated to date. The present paper is motivated by this debate. It attempts to test whether the maintained hypotheses on the causes of deforestation can give answer to the problem in sub-Saharan Africa. It used average cross-national data of forty eight countries in the region. The data are retrieved from international sources. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between two deforestation indicators and five often-cited causes of deforestation were computed. The role of public forest ownership, share of forest and agricultural products in total exports, and the year of forest laws enacted are also discussed.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{results of}} analyses of data from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment on changes in forest ownership, public income and expenditure on forestry and forestry employment. Forest ownership continued to show less state control and <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests.</b> This was due to private-sector investment and, in some countries, the transfer of public forests to the private-sector (including local communities). This contrasts somewhat with results on public income and expenditure, which indicate that public expenditure on forestry has increased dramatically over the last decade, while income has increased by very little. Global employment in forestry has not changed much {{over the last two}} decades and has remained at about 12. 7 million people, with the majority of these employed in informal activities, particularly in Asia. While production of many if not most forest goods and services has increased, labour productivity has improved at the same time, leading to this result. Comparing the results for groups of countries at different income levels, it appears that higher income countries tend to have a relatively high proportion of private forest ownership, high levels of labour productivity and high levels of public spending (per hectare) on forestry. However, apart from these very general differences in outcomes related to income levels, there does not appear to be strong correlation between these socioeconomic variables and other forest-related variables collected in the FRA...|$|E
40|$|In most European states, large {{stretches}} of forest are public property. In Austria, 15 {{percent of the}} country's forests belong {{to the federal government}} (Austrian Federal Forests, ÖBF), and another 3 percent {{are in the hands of}} provinces and communities. Public <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> has its roots in history, but is difficult to justify in economic terms. The society's interest in preserving the welfare (i. e., protective and recreational) function of the forest is assured by the forestry law, which, for 150 years, has set strict standards for forest management, and open access to forests for the public was first granted 25 years ago. ÖBF was a federally operated enterprise until 1997. State enterprises are usually less efficient than their privately owned counterparts, the consequence of limited decision-making powers, rigid and strictly regulated workflows and a wage system not affected by the economic success or failure of an operation. The operational and managerial weaknesses suffered by ÖBF were to be overcome by turning it into a public limited company (under sole federal ownership). From a macroeconomic point of view it is interesting to investigate whether the spinoff actually boosted productivity, both of labour and the land, and improved the utilisation of other resources.
