We used Latent Class Analysis to identify groups Of Students with similar role relationships with three focal figures. We performed Latent Class Logistic Regression to explore the relationships of the latent classes with the Big Five personality factors. Personality was assessed with the Five Factor Personality Inventory. We found three personal network types: a primarily family oriented network, a primarily peer oriented network, and a mixed family/peer oriented network. We found significant associations between personality and personal network type.

However, the mechanism by which this coherence can be maintained {{in the face of}} strong interactions with the cellular environment has remained unclear. This Letter addresses the problem of decoherence between two electron spins due to hyperfine interaction with a bath of spin 1 / 2 nuclei. Dynamics of the radical pair density matrix are derived and shown to yield a simple mechanism for sensing magnetic field orientation. Rates of dephasing and decoherence are calculated ab initio and found to yield millisecond coherence times, consistent with behavioral experiments...|$|R

The two major troughs which comprise this rock formation are 62 ft wide by 118 ft long and 7 ft wide by 52 ft long. Initially, infrequent runoff eroded these troughs along joints within the Navajo Sandstone. After their formation, the drainage basin, which fed rainwater to these troughs, shrank {{to the point that}} the runoff became insufficient to contribute to the cutting of these troughs. As a result, the troughs are now almost exclusively eroded by wind, as indicated by the orientation of erosional steps and risers cut into the sandstone along their steep walls.

50|$|On {{the side}} {{opposite}} of the cathode plane {{is a set of}} anode wire planes set at potentials much higher (less negative) than that of the cathode. Each plane is separated from its neighbors by a small gap, usually on the order of 1 cm. A plane consists of many parallel conducting wires spaced by a few millimeters, and the angle at which the wires are <b>oriented</b> <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the vertical varies from plane to plane. Together, these planes read out signals from the drift electrons. For a detector with N anode wire planes, the inner N − 1 planes are called induction planes. These are set at lower (more negative) potentials than the outer plane, allowing drift electrons to pass through them, inducing signals that are used for event reconstruction. The outer plane is called the collection plane because the drift electrons are collected on these wires, producing additional signals. Having multiple planes with different wire orientations permits two-dimensional event reconstruction, while the third dimension is found from electron drift times.|$|E

Two control algorithms are proposed suitable for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with submillimeter accuracy and for minimally invasive micro-surgery (MIMS) with submicrometer accuracy. The RCM constraint is performed without having any mechanical constraint. Control algorithms also apply orientation constraint preventing the tip <b>to</b> <b>orient</b> <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the soft tissues due to the robot movements.

Based on the phylogenetic distribution of geo-sensory systems and the consistent expression of Pax- 258 in the cells that form these systems, we propose that Pax- 258, along with POU-III and -IV genes, has an ancient and conserved role in the formation of structures responsible for balance and geotaxis in eumetazoans...|$|R

40|$|A {{pigmented}} region {{adjacent to}} photoreceptive nerve endings provides the mechanism for discriminating {{the direction of}} light {{in a wide variety}} of small animals (Burr, 1984 a). For example, some planarian species have a pair of shallow pigment cups lined with several hundred photoreceptors (Taliaferro, 1920; Carpenter et al., 1974), and Drosophila spp. larvae have lateral pits in the black-pigmented pharyngeal skeleton that contain a cluster of 12 photoreceptors (Sawin et al., 1994). In these relatively transparent animals, the structures would restrict the illumination of the photoreceptors to a selected region of visual space, and the nerve signals generated as the animals move would provide the information used <b>to</b> <b>orient</b> <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the direction of light (Burr, 1984 b). Planaria maculata seek dark regions of their environment and crawl away from a horizontal light source. Drosophila spp. larvae burrow into their food and are negatively phototactic during their feeding phase. However, this changes to positive phototaxis during the third instar, which probably aids in finding a suitable pupation site (Sawin et al., 1994).

40|$|The sensing of {{mechanical}} forces modulates several cellular responses as adhesion, migration and differentiation. Transient elevations of calcium concentration {{play a key}} role in the activation of cells following mechanical stress, but it is still unclear how eukaryotic cells convert a mechanical signal into an ion flux. In this study, we used the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum to assess systematically the role of individual calcium channels in mechanosensing.

Mutant pkd 2 KO cells lose the ability <b>to</b> <b>orient</b> <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> a shear flow, whereas their ability to move towards a chemoattractant is unaffected. PKD 2 is also important for calcium-induced lysosome exocytosis: WT cells show a transient, 2 -fold increase in lysosome secretion upon sudden exposure to high levels of extracellular calcium, but pkd 2 KO cells do not.
