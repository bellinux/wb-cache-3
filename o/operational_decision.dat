The evidence from a sample of Brazilian firms suggests that listing on the São Paulo Stock Exchange´s Corporate Governance Special Listing Segments, which requires enhanced corporate governance practices, among other requirements, and auditing {{by one of the}} Big Four firms reduce in general earnings management by accounting choices, and that qualified opinion from auditor  is an indicator of earnings management.

2500|$|The precise {{origins of}} the {{decision}} to establish the review are unclear. A claim that the study was initiated by a Presidential request to the National Security Council (NSC) appears to be incorrect. No NSC meetings were held on the relevant dates [...] and the President was in Kansas on the 27 and 28 July, resting after attending the Democratic Party convention on the 26th. The Ralph L Clark memo of the 29th July contains a footnote reference to a meeting, “OSI:FCD:RLC mtw (28July52)” which appears to indicate a 28 July 1952 meeting between F C Durant and Clark on this subject. The decision to initiate the CIA study appears therefore to have been taken around July 28, although D/CI (Director of Central Intelligence) involvement in the study and Haines’ reference to White House interest suggests that the FCD:RLC meeting was not itself the formal decision point. The decision appears to have been an <b>operational</b> <b>decision</b> taken outside of formal structures such as NSC meetings, as was common for urgent matters.|$|E

40|$|Many {{owners of}} growing privately held firms make <b>operational</b> and {{financial}} <b>decisions</b> {{in an effort}} to maximize the expected present value of the proceeds from an initial public offering (IPO). We ask: ÜWhat is the right time to make an IPO?Ý and ÜHow should <b>operational</b> and financial <b>decisions</b> be coordinated to increase the likelihood of a successful IPO?Ý Financial and <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> in this problem are linked because adequate financial capital is crucial for <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> to be feasible and <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> affect the firm's access to financial resources. The IPO event is treated as a stopping time in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{supply chain}} settings in which perfect coordination {{can be achieved}} with simple wholesale pricing schemes: either retailer-specific constant unit wholesale prices or retailer-specific volume discount schemes. We confine ourselves to two-echelon supply chains with a single supplier servicing a network of retailers who {{compete with each other}} by selecting sales quantities. We identify a key sufficient condition, in terms of interdependencies between chain members' <b>operational</b> <b>decisions,</b> under which perfect coordination via simple schemes is feasible, under general cost and demand functions. This condition, which we refer to as echelon operational autonomy (EOA), states that the costs incurred by the supplier for a given vector of sales volumes depends only on <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> she controls herself. At the same time, the costs incurred by the retailers may depend on <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> controlled by the supplier, in which case, the supplier's <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> are made to minimize chainwide costs. We show how vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships create EOA and compare the resulting coordinating pricing schemes with those required in a traditional decentralized setting (without EOA). We also discuss compliance issues with the coordinating schemes in view of the Robinson-Patman act and provide remedies to overcome these issues. supply chain coordination, pricing, vendor-managed inventory, echelon operational autonomy...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{measurement}} is the buzzword in today’s business world. This mechanism {{has become}} an essential tool in online marketplace to identify victors and losers. Apparently, virtual stores are searching for decision-oriented performance measures to aid them in addition to identifying strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities make sound strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>decisions</b> as they compete with their peers. In that paradigm this study attempt to measure performance of virtual stores using decision-making associated variables sternly to evaluate {{the impact of the}} variables or indicators on strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>decisions.</b> To achieve this purpose, the study used an evaluation framework to identify drivers which have a significant and positive effect on strategic and <b>operational</b> <b>decisions.</b> The study surveyed 100 internet users in Goteborg of a randomly selected four virtual store (EBay Amazon. com, Yahoo and Buy. com). The results identified three major dimensions: website, product and services and promotion. These dimensions share many common aspects with decision making determinants derived within the context of online market industry. Conversely, these dimensions have unique characteristics inherent in the online marketing environment. The study revealed a significantly positive relationship between the variables on <b>operational</b> and strategic <b>decisions.</b> The conclusion is that the fact that performance measures are assessed to firms’ business activities both <b>operational</b> and strategic <b>decisions</b> initiatives begin with defining users’ needs and preferences, and their related performance variable. If the virtual store understands what dimensions users use to judge quality, they can take appropriate actions to monitor and enhance performance on those dimensions and remedy service failures.
