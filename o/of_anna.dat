5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, she changed tack, and was reconciled with the Grand Ducal family. That particular reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 <b>of</b> <b>Anna</b> Maria Luisa.|$|E

5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs <b>of</b> <b>Anna</b> and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment <b>of</b> <b>Anna</b> Cooke.

5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth.

The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century.
