40|$|Concurrent variable-ratio {{schedules}} {{of electrical}} brain stimulation, food, and water were paired in various combinations as reinforcement <b>of</b> rats' lever <b>presses.</b> Relative prices <b>of</b> the concurrent reinforcers were varied {{by changing the}} ratio of the response requirements on the two levers. Economic substitutability, measured by the sensitivity of response ratio to changes in relative price, was highest with brain stimulation reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>presses</b> on both levers and lowest with food reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>presses</b> on one lever and water reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>presses</b> on the other. Substitutability with brain stimulation reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>presses</b> on one lever and either food or water reinforcement for presses on the other was about as high as with brain stimulation for presses on both levers. Electrical brain stimulation for rats may thus serve as an economic substitute for two reinforcers, neither of which is substitutable for the other...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the physical characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>pressed</b> complete feed in the forms of cube, cylinder and ball. The {{study was conducted to}} get a complete feed of dairy cows that can be developed commercially. The evaluation was done on a physical test: bulkiness, hardness and hygroscopic properties <b>of</b> <b>pressed</b> complete feeds. The results of this research showed that the bulkiness <b>of</b> <b>pressed</b> complete feed in the forms cubes, cylinders and balls were between 0. 20 up to 0. 48 liter/kg; the hardness <b>of</b> <b>pressed</b> complete feed, cylinders and balls were 3 lbs up to 14 lbs; the hygroscopic factor <b>of</b> <b>pressed</b> complete feed in the forms cubes, cylinders and balls were around 1. 10 % up to 9. 69 %.

5|$|The Danish Union <b>of</b> <b>Press</b> Photographers (Pressefotografforbundet) {{is claimed}} to be the world's first {{national}} organization for newspaper photographers. It was founded in 1912 in Copenhagen by six press photographers. Today it has over 800 members.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>press</b> reports {{came out}} during the Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|As radicalism {{took hold}} in Britain in the 1790s, Johnson became {{increasingly}} involved in its causes: {{he was a}} member of the Society for Constitutional Information, which was attempting to reform Parliament; he published works defending Dissenters after the religiously motivated Birmingham Riots in 1791; and he testified on behalf of those arrested during the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims <b>of</b> <b>press</b> gangs, and those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood <b>of</b> <b>press</b> interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E

The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush <b>of</b> <b>press</b> scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series <b>of</b> <b>Press</b> Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number <b>of</b> <b>press</b> passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
