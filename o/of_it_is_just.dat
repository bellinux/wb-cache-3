500|$|On April 16, 2007, {{the book}} was {{announced}} as {{the winner of the}} Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. [...] Applegate said of her win, [...] "Half <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> good luck... Had it come out four years ago, I don't think the climate was ready for it. The religious right intersection with politics is very important now." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the album}} is {{presented}} in-character {{through the eyes of}} various fictional characters and onlookers. [...] "Fortune 500" [...] documents a fictional attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II, which Higgs relates to the thoughts of suicide bombers moments before they detonate: [...] "The horror of the doubt is far worse than the act, for the terrorist I mean. It’s this 'oh shit... maybe this isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest moment on the record." [...] Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs [...] "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea into something that on the face <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> there to be enjoyed". Higgs told NME that Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.|$|E
500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what it is. A lot <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{recalled}} of {{his performance}} in the game, [...] "It {{was a good one}} for me today. Some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the ball popping out and being {{in the right place at}} the right time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a team effort. The guys did a good job up front." [...] Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said of Gregory's recovery of the fumble, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a good scoop-and-score play." ...|$|R

500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; a lot <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the way he [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E

2500|$|SIDS {{deaths in}} the US {{decreased}} from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004. But, during a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS being listed {{as the cause of}} death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%. According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS [...] "A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn't decreasing significantly, but that a lot <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> code shifting".|$|E
2500|$|On January 18, 2006, Brown {{stated that}} {{certainly}} things {{could have been}} handled differently, such as calling in the military. As {{one of the largest}} natural disasters to ever strike the U.S., he stated, [...] "It was beyond the capacity of the state and local governments, and it was beyond the capacity of FEMA." [...] On February 10, 2006, Brown again testified before Congress, this time placing blame on the Department of Homeland Security for the poor handling of the disaster, asserting that the anti-terrorism focus of the department had caused it to deny resources needed to properly operate FEMA. In his February 2006 testimony, Brown also contradicted earlier claims that the White House was unaware of levees having been breached, stating: [...] "For them to claim that we didn't have awareness <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> baloney." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bad wind to-day. Sometimes {{the wind}} don't bother me when I am flying, and sometimes, like to-day, {{it seems as}} though the one thing in the whole confounded world is the confounded wind that roars in your ears and makes your eyes water and sneaks down your collar to chill your spine and goes scooting up your sleeves, unless you have gauntlets, and makes your ears sting. Roar, roar, roar, the wind's worse than the noisiest old {{cast-iron}} tin-can Vrenskoy motor.

6000|$|We want {{to think}} of women not--as their own sex would show them--as Lorleis luring us to destruction, but as good angels beckoning us upward. They have more power for good or evil than they dream <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> at the very age when a man's {{character}} is forming that he tumbles into love, and then the lass he loves has the making or marring of him. Unconsciously he molds himself to what she would have him, good or bad. I am sorry to have to be ungallant enough to say that I do not think they always use their influence for the best. Too often the female world is bounded hard and fast within the limits of the commonplace. Their ideal hero is a prince of littleness, and to become that many a powerful mind, enchanted by love, is [...] "lost to life and use and name and fame." ...|$|E

You can climb up that trellis, Thomas, and lift up that window-sash very carefully, so's not to make no noise, and get in. Then you'll be in a back room, with a door right in front of you which opens into Mr. and Mrs. Green's bedroom. There's always a little night lamp burning in it, by which you can see to get about. In the corner, on your right as you go into the room, is a table with my instrument-box standing on it. The box is pretty heavy, and there is a handle on top to carry it by. You needn't be afraid to go in, for by this time they are both sound asleep, and you can pick up the box and walk out as gingerly as a cat, having of course taken your shoes off before you went in. Then you can hand the box out the back window to me,--I can climb up high enough to reach it,--and you can scuttle down, and we'll be off, having the best rig on Williamson Green that I ever heard of in my born days.' ...|$|E
