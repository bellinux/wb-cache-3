5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do <b>other</b> <b>nuts.</b> A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
25|$|Sesame {{has one of}} {{the highest}} oil {{contents}} of any seed. With a rich, nutty flavor, it is a common ingredient in cuisines across the world. Like <b>other</b> <b>nuts</b> and foods, it can trigger allergic reactions in some people.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} eat a {{range of}} foods, such as tree bark, tree buds, berries, many types of seeds and acorns, walnuts, and <b>other</b> <b>nuts,</b> and some types of fungi found in the forests, including fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria). They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft cambial tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) suffer the greatest damage.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>other</b> <b>nut</b> oils, {{pistachio}} oil has {{a particularly}} strong flavor. Like <b>other</b> <b>nut</b> oils, it tastes {{similar to the}} nut from which it is extracted. Pistachio oil is high in Vitamin E, containing 19mg/100g. It contains 12.7% saturated fats, 53.8% monounsaturated fats, 32.7% linoleic acid, and 0.8% omega-3 fatty acid. Pistachio oil {{is used as a}} table oil to add flavor to foods such as steamed vegetables.|$|R

500|$|The Late Woodland Period {{was once}} {{considered}} to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity. Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. Gone are the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, {{but this does not}} appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. [...] Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize. Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, <b>other</b> <b>nuts</b> and fruits, goosefoot, little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade. [...] The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa. At Rainbow, a large house was excavated, showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families. Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group.|$|E
2500|$|Data {{from the}} hardest hit areas along the central Louisiana coast remains sparse due to the small {{population}} density of the area.

The incident resulted in the deaths of eight and six injuries. Although there were no stations to report the intensity of winds in Erath, winds [...] away in Abbeville reached [...] Hilda's sharp curve eastward after landfall and the advection of cold air from the north resulted in gusty winds over the New Orleans area, causing waves to break and spill over the seawall protecting the city from Lake Pontchartrain. The resulting waterfront flooding damaged fishing camps and other shoreline property. Elsewhere in southeastern Louisiana, strong winds stripped pecans and <b>other</b> <b>nuts</b> off of trees.|$|E
60|$|There were {{flocks of}} wild ducks on the Reservoirs and on Old River, and flocks of kildees on the Commons; {{and there were}} {{squirrels}} in the woods, where there was abundant mast for the pigs that ran wild in them, and battened on the nuts under the hickory-trees. There were no <b>other</b> <b>nuts</b> except walnuts, white and black; {{but there was no}} end to the small, sweetish acorns, which the boys called chinquepins; they ate them, but I doubt if they liked them, except as boys like anything to eat. In the vast corn-fields stretching everywhere along the river levels there were quails; and rabbits in the sumac thickets and turnip patches. There were places to swim, to fish, to hunt, to skate; if there were no hills for coasting, that was not so much loss, for there was very little snow, and it melted {{in a day or two}} after it fell. But besides these natural advantages for boys, there were artificial opportunities which the boys treated as if they had been made for them; grist-mills on the river and canal, cotton-factories and saw-mills on the Hydraulic, iron-founderies by the Commons, breweries on the river-bank, and not too many school-houses. I must not forget the market-house, with its public market twice a week, and its long rows of market-wagons, stretching on either side of High Street in the dim light of the summer dawn or the cold sun of the winter noon.|$|E

5000|$|A jam nut {{is often}} used when a nut needs to be locked in place without {{clamping}} against another object.

Then the <b>other</b> <b>nut</b> is screwed down on top of the first nut. The inner nut is then slackened back and tightened against the outer nut.|$|R
