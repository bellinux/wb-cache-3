5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture {{that was found}} to have significant adverse effects <b>on</b> <b>wildlife,</b> particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native riparian vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of their time to JCWC activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact <b>on</b> <b>wildlife,</b> and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
