50|$|The Australian Rally Championship {{caters to}} a range of {{different}} competitors in the series and with a number of classes and categories; competitors can start rallying at the level that best suits their budget. The outright competition is fought out amongst the names of rallying and is the ultimate test for the competitors at the pointy end of the field. The ARC’s top drivers compete in Group N (Production) - cars which have direct links to their road-going counterparts. The ARC also offers opportunities for manufacturers who don’t produce Group N cars to build comparable machinery under both the Group N (P) and FIA Super 2000 regulations. Another award that is desirable for competitors to chase is the Privateers Cup for competitors who don't have support from the manufacturer teams. The F16 Championship is the small car category (1600cc, 2WD) and a budget-level place to start rallying. The outright winner of the Championship is an Australian Champion in the small car category and is added to the record books. The Aussie Cup is the Australian award for large cars (over 2500cc) that enables competitors in the big cars to run popular passenger car models such as V6 and V8’s. Amongst the <b>outright</b> <b>awards</b> are the opportunities to chase individual class awards that are based on car capacity and specification which gives competitors the opportunity to pursue class victories.|$|R

In the first versions done by Al Clark, the film was poorly received by preview audiences and studio executives. Parrish discovered that a [...] "montage approach" [...] was much more successful, with arbitrary cuts made a set time before and after each important action. In addition to the editing nomination for Clark and Parrish, the film won the Best Picture <b>Award</b> <b>outright</b> and was a popular success.|$|R

5000|$|... 1989 saw the {{formation}} of the State Basketball League (SBL) with both a men's and women's competition. Willetton, trading as the Tigers, entered a team into both the MSBL and WSBL. While the women missed a playoff spot with a 6-15 record, the men finished in the top six with a 17-5 record. They went on to lose to the Geraldton Buccaneers in the semi-finals. Jeff Anderson was subsequently named the Co-Most Valuable Player of the MSBL's inaugural season alongside Pete Hansen of the Perry Lakes Hawks. Anderson {{went on to win the}} MVP <b>award</b> <b>outright</b> in 1990 before retiring following the 1995 season. In 174 SBL games for the Tigers between 1989 and 1995, Anderson averaged 25.2 points per game. Upon retiring from playing basketball, he took on the head coaching role for the Tigers men in 1996, winning MSBL Coach of the Year honours in his first season. Despite Anderson's individual success, he was unable to lead the Tigers to a maiden SBL championship during his time at the club.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{he joined}} Port Melbourne in the VFA, and {{was part of}} the club's senior premiership team in his first season. Standing at only 173 cm tall, Swan played a variety of roles, before he {{cemented}} a position as the centreman in the strong Port Melbourne team which won three consecutive premierships from 1980 until 1982. He won the J. J. Liston Trophy as the best and fairest player in the VFA First Division in both 1982 and 1983; he originally finished second behind Preston's Geoff Austen for the 1982 award on countback, but was later made a joint-winner of the award when the countback was retrospectively eliminated; he won the 1983 <b>award</b> <b>outright</b> by a margin of three votes. Altogether, in thirteen seasons with Port Melbourne, Swan played 219 games, won four premierships, two club best and fairest awards (1982 and 1986) and served as club captain from 1986 until 1988. He was named as a wingman in the Port Melbourne Team of the Century (despite the fact that his entire Port Melbourne career was played during the VFA's 16-a-side era when there were no wingmen).|$|R
2500|$|Mrs Morrell left {{an estate}} of £157,000 and made eight cash bequests of between £300 and £1,000. Cullen claims {{that in some}} of the several wills she made Adams was bequeathed large sums of money and her Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (valued at £1,500). This appears {{incorrect}} and, in her will of 5 August 1950, he was only <b>awarded</b> <b>outright</b> a chest of silver cutlery worth £276, with a contingent right to the car and a Jacobean court cupboard if Mrs Morrell's son pre-deceased her A codicil of 13 September 1950 cut Adams out of her will completely. She died on 13 November 1950 aged 81. Adams certified the cause of death as [...] "stroke" [...] and on inspecting the body, slit her wrist to ensure she was dead. Despite the last codicil, Mrs Morrell's son gave Adams the Rolls-Royce which was 19 years old, and the chest of silver cutlery. After Mrs Morrell's death, he also took away an infrared lamp she had bought herself, worth £60. Adams billed Morrell's estate for 1,100 visits, costing £1,674 in total. The police estimated that Adams had visited Morrell a total of 321 times during her treatment. On her cremation form, Adams stated that [...] "as far as I am aware" [...] he had no pecuniary interest in the death, thereby avoiding the necessity of a post-mortem.|$|R

González was {{selected}} to major league all-star teams selected by the Associated Press (OF) and Baseball America (DH) and to the Sporting News A.L. all-star squad (OF). He was named as an outfielder on the A.L. Silver Slugger Award team for the 5th time in his career, his 3rd consecutive year. González shared Rangers Player of the Month honors with Iván Rodríguez in April and won the <b>award</b> <b>outright</b> in May. González also received the American League Player of the Week, for August 31 - September 6.

Juan also became the 1st native of Latin America to ever win multiple MVP's since the award was instituted in 1931. This award also made him the 16th player to capture 2 MVP's in a 3-year span. The Rangers reached the playoffs, only to be swept by the Yankees. The Rangers offense was miserable in the Division Series, scoring just one run on a Pudge Rodriguez single that knocked in Juan (who had doubled to lead off the inning).|$|R
50|$|Since 1 January 1951, five 15-minute episodes (since 1998, six 12½-minute episodes) {{have been}} {{transmitted}} each week, at {{first on the}} BBC Light Programme and subsequently on the BBC Home Service (now Radio 4). Early afternoon repeats of the previous evening's episode began on 14 December 1964. The original scriptwriters were Geoffrey Webb and Edward J. Mason, who were also working on the nightly thriller series about the special agent Dick Barton. The popularity of his adventures partly inspired The Archers, which eventually took over Barton's evening slot. At first, however, the national launch placed the serial at the 'terrible' time of 11.45am, but it moved to Dick Barton's former slot of 6.45pm from Monday, 2 April 1951. An omnibus edition of the week's episodes began on Saturday, 5 January 1952. Originally produced with collaborative input from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, The Archers was conceived {{as a means of}} disseminating information to farmers and smallholders to help increase productivity in the post-World War II years of rationing and food shortages. It was originally formulated around the lives of three farmers; Dan Archer, farming efficiently with little cash, Walter Gabriel, farming inefficiently with little cash, and George Fairbrother, a wealthy businessman farming at a loss for tax purposes (which one could do in those days). The programme was hugely successful, winning the National Radio Awards' 'Most entertaining programme of the Year' award jointly with Take It From Here in 1954, and winning the <b>award</b> <b>outright</b> in 1955, in which year the audience was reported to have peaked at 20 million.|$|R
