5000|$|There is {{some doubt}} {{as to whether the}} <b>onycha</b> of the Old Testament was {{actually}} the operculum of a sea snail. [...] H.J. Abrahams says, [...] "The widely held mollusk hypothesis becomes quite perplexing if one considers that the mollusk was counted among the unclean animals in the Bible (Chapters Leviticus 11:9 and 12)." [...] Sea creatures such as the mollusk were an “abomination” and even their carcasses were to be considered an “abomination” and anyone simply touching them became unclean. Rabbeinu Bachyei insisted that only kosher species may be used for the mishkan. The Gemara states that “only items that one may eat may be used for the work of Heaven.” Nachmanides, Torah scholar and famed Jewish theologian, emphasized that the commandment concerning unclean animals pertained also to temple services. James Strong and J. McClintoch write that “it seems improbable that any such substance could {{have been one of the}} constituent spices of the most holy perfume; not only because we know of none bearing any powerful and agreeable odor, but specially because all marine creatures that were not finned and scaled fishes were unclean, and as such could not have been touched by the priests or used in the sanctuary.” [...] There is also some doubt that a mollusk would have been referred to as a sweet spice. Bahr states that “the odor of the burned shells is not pleasant.” [...] Although the word <b>onycha</b> has been interpreted as meaning [...] "nail" [...] it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx which antiquity often describes as a black stone. Coincidentally <b>onycha</b> is the Greek word which was chosen to replace the original Hebrew word which was shecheleth. One of the Hebrew words that shecheleth seems to be related to, שחלים, sh'chalim, refers to a large variety of plants. An ancient Ugaritic text lists <b>onycha</b> among types of vegetables, implying that <b>onycha</b> was a vegetable also. The Talmud specifically states that although <b>onycha</b> (shecheleth) is not from a tree, it does grow from the ground and that it is a plant (Kerithoth 6b). Condor writes “Shecheleth, Exod. xxx. 34; is rendered by the Septuagint, <b>onycha,</b> and by the Arabic version, ladana [...] [...] [...] The root of the Hebrew word means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” James Strong writes [...] "the Syriac etymology of the word, namely, to run in drops, exude, distil, would lead to the idea of a resinous and odoriferous substance of the vegetable kingdom." [...] Another writer says “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant, perhaps gum-ladanum. The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” [...] "Shecheleth" [...] identifies with the Syriac [...] "shehelta" [...] which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{plant is}} the [...] "official" [...] source of styrax, an herbal {{medicine}} known from ancient times. Some believe {{it to have}} been the stacte used together with frankincense, galbanum, and <b>onycha</b> to make Ketoret, the Tabernacle incense of the Old Testament.|$|E
5000|$|Rashi {{writes that}} <b>onycha</b> was a root from the ground. Benzoin almonds do not {{resemble}} the resins they actually are but {{appear as a}} rough stony almonds. Not being native to Palestine they {{could easily have been}} mistaken as portions of a root since they do not seem to adequately resemble any other portion of a plant body. However it seems that the root of benzoin was also used. The ancient Greeks and Romans used benzoin root in a seasoning sauce for a meat boiled in sweet herbs. A Roman supper sometimes included shellfish prepared with pepper, cinnamon, and benzoin root. Benzoin root was also used in a recipe for seasoning goose liver. Benzoin root is still used today in incense recipes. Also the resin proper is procured near the root of the tree. Resin procured from the tree during the first three years is referred to as head benzoin. That which is obtained during the next 7 or 8 years is known as the belly benzoin. The third type is called foot benzoin, and is obtained by splitting the tree and scraping the wood of the trunk and roots. This latter source contains impurities. Rambam says that <b>onycha</b> was rubbed with bitter vetch to remove impurities. The Talmud also appears to indicate that <b>onycha</b> came from an annual plant. Benzoin gum is harvested annually, and not being native to Palestine it is possible confusion slipped in identifying its annual yield with its life span. Different Styrax trees are often misidentified or referred to as a [...] "bush." [...] <b>Onycha</b> {{is said to have been}} soaked in wine to enhance its fragrance which was often done with resins used for incense.|$|E

Interestingly the writer refers to [...] "onyx" [...] as opposed to [...] "onycha" [...] while referencing styrax {{as part of the}} formula. Stacte may have been light myrrh treated with benzoin.Onycha may have been labdanum. [...] Since myrrh was often mixed with labdanum, throughout many centuries benzoin and labdanum may have inadvertently switched places in the formula. [...] The possibility exists that the <b>onycha</b> of Exodus 30 was labdanum while the <b>onycha</b> of the second Temple was benzoin, with both ingredients still remaining in both formulas.|$|E
5000|$|Labdanum and benzoin {{were often}} mixed together. The {{reproduced}} scent of ambergris is predominantly {{a mix of}} labdanum and benzoin. Ambergris {{was used by the}} ancient Egyptians as an incense. For centuries, benzoin has been mixed with labdanum, particularly in the Middle East, as an incense to scent homes, places of worship, and as an air purifier. This blend was used by the ancient Egyptians as an incense. Based on some of the latest research from the Edfu temple and a recent studyof ceramic dishes used in the preparation of kyphi, it appears that labdanum mixed with benzoin was {{an important part of the}} kyphi recipe. It was also part of the formula written about by Nostradamus who said it made “the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world” and that it acted as an air purifier against disease. [...] It is possible that <b>onycha</b> was this mix of labdanum and Styrax benzoin. Styrax (referred to as storax in antiquity) is mentioned alongside of <b>onycha</b> in Eccesiasticus 24:15 when alluding to the sacred incense. Either <b>onycha</b> and styrax were originally mixed together or styrax was treated with labdanum or by the time of the first temple period a fifth ingredient was added to the ketoret.

50|$|Some writers {{believe that}} <b>onycha</b> was the fingernail-like operculum, or trap door, of certain sea snails, {{including}} Strombus lentiginosus, Murex anguliferus, Onyx marinus, and Unguis odoratus. This operculum is the trap {{door of a}} shell, called by the Latins Conchylium. These opercula may be of different sizes, but their overall shape {{is that of a}} claw, which is the origin of the name Unguis odoratus. The name Blatta Byzantina is occasioned by its having usually been imported from Constantinople, the ancient Byzantium. In antiquity the operculum was used as an ingredient in incense. The Baylonian Talmud recorded that <b>onycha</b> was rubbed with an alkali solution prepared from the bitter vetch to remove impurities, it was then soaked in the fermented berry juice of the Caper shrub, or a strong white wine, in order to enhance its fragrance. The operculum was also commonly used as an ingredient in many East Asian incense.|$|E
5000|$|Abrahams {{writes that}} [...] "the Hebrew name shecheleth was {{translated}} as ladana, {{giving rise to}} labdanum." [...] The renowned Jewish scholar and writer Saadya (Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon, 882-942), born in Upper Egypt (Fayum) and educated in Fustat (Old Cairo), translated the Bible into Arabic. Saadya, who was a theologian {{as well as the}} head Rabbi at the Sura Academy, was equally versed in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Arabic, and knew the people and customs of the whole Arabic region intimately. Saadya's translation for Shecheleth was the Arabic [...] "Ladana," [...] and ladana is our ladanum or labdanum. H.J. Abrahams states that [...] "I am sure that Shecheleth (<b>onycha)</b> is a plant product [...] [...] [...] After diligent reflection on all these diverse options, there is little {{doubt in my mind that}} <b>onycha</b> of Exodus 30:34 is labdanum. Saadya's labdanum is not only ideally suited for use in incense, but it is also a product of the Jewish homeland." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Onycha</b> (Greek: ονυξ), {{along with}} equal parts of stacte, galbanum, and frankincense, {{was one of}} the {{components}} of the consecrated Ketoret (incense) which appears in the Torah book of Exodus (Ex.30:34-36) and was used in the Jerusalem's Solomon's Temple. This formula was to be incorporated as an incense, and was not to be duplicated for non-sacred use. What the <b>onycha</b> of antiquity actually was cannot be determined with certainty. The original Hebrew word used for this component of the ketoret was שחלת, shecheleth, which means [...] "to roar; as a lion (from his characteristic roar)" [...] or “peeling off by concussion of sound." [...] Shecheleth is related to the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation.” In Aramaic, the root SHCHL signifies “retrieve.” [...] When the Torah was translated into Greek (the Septuagint version) the Greek word “onycha” ονυξ, which means [...] "fingernail" [...] or [...] "claw," [...] was substituted for shecheleth.|$|E
50|$|Opercula {{of certain}} gastropods, {{especially}} varieties from the Red Sea, have long {{served as an}} incense material in ancient Jewish tradition, as well as Arabian cultures.

5000|$|The {{flowers of}} the {{rockrose}} bush {{are described as}} having petals with scarlet and black fingernail-shaped markings, thus its historically acclaimed connection with the Greek ονυξ (= onyx). [...] Lynne writes, “Onycha [...] [...] [...] is a rockrose which produces a gum that is known as labdanum. The blossoms are about three inches across, white with {{at the base of}} each petal a blotch of brilliant scarlet-rose which deepens into black. In Greek <b>onycha</b> means 'fingernail.' The blotch of color in each petal looks exactly like a brightly painted red fingernail.” [...] Others proclaim that the very petals of this plant are shaped like finger nails. Again, <b>onycha</b> in Greek means “fingernail” or “claw.” Claws were used in ancient Egypt to collect labdanum. Pharaohs were pictured with this claw (a nekhakha) resting on their breasts. [...] Claws, or rakes, were used to collect the labdanum from the cistus bushes and smaller claws, or combs, were used to collect labdamun from the beards of the wild goats. [...] Removing and peeling the very sticky, adhesive labdanum from these very temperamental animals caused them to cry out, to “peel out by the concussion of sound,” or to “roar” out in protest. As mentioned above the original Hebrew word for <b>onycha</b> was שחלת, shecheleth, which comes from a root meaning [...] "to roar" [...] or “peeling off by concussion of sound." [...] In Aramaic, the root SHCHL signifies “retrieve.” For thousands of years labdanum has been retrieved from the beards of goats and the wool of lambs by this method. The resin was peeled off of the goats beard, lambs wool, and from the lambadistrion. Interestingly the Arabic word for peel is sahala. The Pharaohs beard was made up of goats hair which was held together and scented by labdanum. When the royal kingly Pharaoh spoke it was as the lion's “roar,” the voice of god to the people. The Pharaoh was called the [...] "incarnation of Atum." [...] Massy writes that, [...] "The lion was a zootype of Atum [...] [...] [...] He is called the lion-faced in the Ritual [...] [...] [...] He is addressed as a lion god, the god in lion form." [...] Pharaohs were often depicted as part human and part lion wearing the false beard saturated with labdanum. This beard was inspired by the lion's mane and was part of the various sphinx depicting the Pharaohs. A sphinx of Pharaoh Hatsheput displays a lion's mane and the pharaoh's manufactured beard. [...] Strong defines the root word of shecheleth as [...] "to roar; a lion (from his characteristic roar)." [...] Labdanum was used not only as a perfume and adhesive for the Pharaohs beard but was also used by the Egyptian art of the apothecary in an incense known as kyphi which was rolled into small balls and burned upon coals of fire. However labdanum could also be an ingredient of a powdered incense. When aged it becomes more fragrant [...] but it also becomes very brittle and hard. The fresh resin is a soft, sticky, and tar-like substance that is sweet, flowery, musky, and reminiscent of honey or ambergris with a hint of sweet leather. Mendes writes that at one point Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamliel, seems to indicate {{that one of the reasons}} wine was used was to make <b>onycha</b> become hard, which would seem to suggest that <b>onycha</b> was not a preexistingly hard mollusk shell, but that <b>onycha</b> was a soft resinous material such as is labdanum. Herodotus affirms that it was much used by the Arabians in perfumes. According to Pliny the Elder (23 - 79 CE), who mentions its fragrant smell, it was the extract of an herb called [...] " [...] ladan." [...] Labdanum was known as [...] "Arabic ladan." ...|$|E
5000|$|The internationally renowned Bible scholar Bochart stated, at {{one point}} in his research, that <b>onycha</b> was {{actually}} benzoin, a gum-resin from the Styrax species. [...] H.J. Abrahams states that the use of benzoin in the Biblical incense is not inconceivable since Syro-Arabian tribes maintained extensive trade routes prior to Hellenism. Styrax Benzoin was available via import to the biblical lands during the Old Testament era. Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE indicates that different kinds of styrax resins were traded. Styrax benzoin was used by the ancient Egyptians in the art of perfumery and incense. The apothecary of Shemot (book of Exodus) would have been familiar with its aromatic uses. S. benzoin has a history steeped in antiquity and was once employed as an incense in Egypt. All the compounds identified in benzoin resin were detected in an archaeological organic residue from an Egyptian ceramic censer, thus proving that this resin was used as one of the components of the mixture of organic materials burned as incense in ancient Egypt. [...] An ancient Egyptian perfume formula (1200 BCE) contained benzoin as one of its chief ingredients. The name [...] "benzoin" [...] is probably derived from Arabic lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي, [...] "Javan frankincense"); compare the mid-eastern terms [...] "gum benjamin" [...] and [...] "benjoin". The word 'Storax' is an alteration of the Late Latin styrax. In the Orphic hymns it is στόρακας or στόρακα. As pointed out earlier, the original word shecheleth was replaced with <b>onycha</b> by the Septuagint translation. <b>Onycha</b> in turn is derived from the onyx stone meaning [...] "fingernail". Conder writes that [...] "the root of the Hebrew word shecheleth means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” Another writer says that the Hebrew shecheleth identifies with the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear or distillation” and that “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant [...] [...] [...] The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” The book of Ecclesiasticus lists storax as one of the ingredients when alluding to the sacred incense of the biblical tabernacle. [...] The Hindustanis use Benzoin to burn in their temples—a circumstance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that benzoin is part of the incense formula of Exodus. [...] The infrequent mention of benzoin by name in antiquity is quite suspicious considering its importance in ancient recipes. [...] It stands to reason it must have been known by another name not currently used today. References to it by name are conspicuously missing also from the Old Testament. Callcott writes “It has been suggested [...] that Gum Benzoin, which is not mentioned by any other name in scripture, must be <b>onycha.</b> Its fracture has exactly the lustre required by the name[...] [...] The gum is a secretion of the bark, and is of great efficacy in healing wounds[...] [...] Such are the pretensions of the Benzoin to be looked upon as the true <b>Onycha,</b> which, from the text, as I have already said, must have been some fragrant vegetable gum in itself, of foreign production, and ranking with stacte, and myrrh, and galbanum [...] [...] [...] all which conditions are fulfilled by the Gum Benzoin.” [...] Dioscorides and Galen describe two kinds of bdellium, the second of which is Benzoin, according to Hardouin and Sprengel. Pererra describes benzoin tears as [...] "flattened pieces, some of which are angular, and the larger of them [...] [...] [...] an inch in length." [...] He says that [...] "externally, these pieces are shiny." [...] This description most certainly fits well with the interpretation of [...] "onycha" [...] which means [...] "fingernail." [...] He continues to say many of the pieces [...] "are of an amber or reddish-yellow colour" [...] and continues to describe parts of it as [...] "translucent or milky, and frequently striped." [...] This is a good description of the appearance of various onyx stones, from which the name <b>onycha</b> is derived. He says that many tears of Styrax benzoin [...] "are translucent, or, in a few cases, almost transparent." [...] One type of benzoin has [...] "numerous, white, small pieces [...] [...] [...] intermingled, which thereby give the broken surface a speckled appearance" [...] which he calls [...] "marbly." [...] As mentioned above, although the word <b>onycha</b> has been interpreted as meaning [...] "nail" [...] it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx. Onyx comes in a variety of colors the most prominent being either the black and veined striped gem or the pinkish translucent striped gem. One related Styrax is black and the benzoin discussed thus far seems to be of the pinkish, translucent sort. Steeping Styrax benzoin tears in wine can enhance its fragrance as well as its translucent qualities and [...] "shiny" [...] appearance, thus making it appear even more like the onyx gem. Rambam stated that soaking <b>onycha</b> in wine made it beautiful. Benzoin tears look very different from other resins and appear to be small stones rather than the vegetable product that it is.|$|E

Three hundred and sixty eight mina were in it: three hundred sixty five corresponding to the days of the solar year - a mina for each day, half in the morning and half in the afternoon, and three extra mina, from which the Kohen Gadol would bring both his handfuls the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur. He would return them to the mortar on the day preceding Yom Kippur, and grind them very thoroughly so that they would be exceptionally fine. Eleven kinds of spices were in it, as follows: (1) stacte, (2) <b>onycha,</b> (3) galbanum, (4) frankincense - each weighing seventy mina each comprising 19.02% of the total weight; (5) myrrh, (6) cassia, (7) spikenard, (8) saffron, each weighing sixteen mina each comprising 4.35% of the total weight; (9) costus - twelve mina 3.26% of the total weight; (10) aromatic bark - three 0.82% of the total weight; and (11) cinnamon - nine 2.45% of the total weight; Additionally Carshina lye, nine kab; Cyprus wine, three se'ah and three kab - if he has no Cyprus wine, he brings old white wine; Sodom salt, a quarter-kab; and a minute amount of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nathan of Babylon says: Also a minute amount of Jordan amber. If he added honey, he invalidated it; if he deliberately omitted one of the spices, he was liable to the death penalty.Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: The stacte is nothing more than the sap that drips from the branches of the balsam tree. Why was Carshina lye brought? To refine the <b>onycha,</b> that it be pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine brought? To steep the <b>onycha,</b> that it be pungent; while urine (מי רגליים - mei raglaiim) was more suited for this, nevertheless, one did not bring urine into the Temple, out of respect.|$|E

It is dry and shining having numerous white spots, like finger-nails in shape. Dioscorides said that bdellium was [...] "the tear of an Arabian tree."

The rock rose is a bush, not a tree (the Talmud states that <b>onycha</b> comes from a ground plant and not a tree) which bears flowers widely noted for the markings upon its petals resembling human fingernails. Labdanum is the gray-black resin that exudes from the branches of the rock rose bush. Labdanum, after it matures, becomes black and is referred to as black amber or black balsam. Gill states that the word [...] "shecheleth is certainly related to the Hebrew word shechor (black)," [...] denoting the color of the shecheleth used in the ketoret formula. <b>Onycha</b> is a play on the word onyx which was a gem. The onyx most esteemed by the ancients was the black gem. The Hebrew word for onyx was shoham and “Braun traces shoham to the Arabic sachma,'blackness:' 'Of such a color,' says he, 'are the Arabian onyxes, which have a black ground-color.' This agrees essentially with Charles William King's remarks [...] 'The Arabian species,' he says, 'were formed of black or blue strata.” [...] The rock rose also has an inseparable identification with rocks because its existence depends upon its roots anchoring among them in areas where no other foliage is able to grow. After labdanum became hard it may have been put through another process causing it to emulate even more of the [...] "beautiful" [...] attributes of the onyx or to refine it, [...] "that it be pleasant." [...] When used in sacred rites resins were often steeped in wine to, among other things, increase their fragrance.|$|E
