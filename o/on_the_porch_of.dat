25|$|A {{man with}} a metal press did a fair sort of {{business}}. He set up for business <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> the hotel. He had constructed a die depicting the Hunterdon County courthouse, surrounded by the legend, Hauptmann Trial, Flemington, N.J. On the stand beside the press lay several hundred bright new pennies and several fine strips of copper. By running the copper strips through the press, together with the pennies, he turned out Lincoln heads backed by the courthouse and the legend. The pieces sold for five cents each, three for a dime.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, a primate {{researcher}} at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized. The researcher's name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held {{in front of his}} home. A Molotov cocktail was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating [...] "you win", and [...] "please don't bother my family anymore". In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.|$|E

500|$|According to MTV, {{the initial}} concept {{for the music}} video was to portray Spears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> a beachfront home {{watching}} {{a group of kids}} having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. The video begins with Spears going to the telescope, and Spears is looking through a telescope. The concept was later changed a man and a dog walk on the beach, portraying the singer as the girl next door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of Rolling Stone noted the video is best known for [...] "purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video", while describing it as [...] "a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazes at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball, then does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to [...] "hold you tight, treat you right." [...] Spears is sitting on a picnic blanket wishing she was there with him. She leaves alone." [...] On February 20, 2012, behind the scenes footage of the music video leaked online.|$|E
