25|$|Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, {{eviscerated}} {{and rinsed}} thoroughly with water. Air is pumped {{under the skin}} through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then soaked in boiling water {{for a short while}} before it is hung up to dry. While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. Having been left to stand for 24 hours, the duck is roasted in an <b>oven</b> <b>until</b> it turns shiny brown.|$|E

60|$|But it {{is never}} too late to mend, so I went into the kitchen this morning and made a tart. You can't imagine what a lot of things one needs even for such a simple thing as that. I thought cook was joking when she put them all down in front of me. It was like a conjurer giving his performance. There was an empty bowl, and a bowl full of sliced apples, and a big board, and a rolling-pin, and eggs, and butter, and sugar, and cloves, and of course flour. We broke eggs and put them into a bowl--you can't think what a mess an egg makes when it misses the bowl. Then we stirred them up with flour and butter and things. I stirred until I was {{perfectly}} exhausted. No wonder a cook has usually a great thick arm. Then when it had formed a paste, we rolled it out, and put the apples in the dish, and roofed it in, and trimmed the edges, and stuck flat leaves made of paste all over it, and the dearest little crown in the middle. Then we put it into the <b>oven</b> <b>until</b> it was brown. It looked a very nice tart, and mamma said that I had made it very solidly. It certainly did feel very heavy for its size. Mamma would not taste it, because she said that she thought Dr. Tristram would not approve of her doing so, but I had a piece, and really it was not so bad. Mamma said the servants might have it at dinner, but the servants said that the poor window-cleaner had a large family, and so we gave it to him. It is so sweet to feel that one is of any use to any one.|$|E

30|$|Grain and stubble {{yield data}} were {{collected}} from the three harvestable rows by excluding over-favored plants (plants that stand at a spacing exceeding the required distance due to missing plants in a row). The harvested biomass was weighed for fresh biomass weight after which the ears and the stubble were separated and weighed. The ears were shelled and grain yield was determined by adjusting to 12.5  % moisture content. Stubble of two stands from each plot was collected from each plot at harvest. The stubble samples were <b>oven</b> dried <b>until</b> constant weight was attained so {{that it was possible to}} calculate the dry stubble yield per plot. The dried biomass yield was determined as the sum of dry grain and dry stubble yields.|$|R

30|$|Approximately 0.5 mg of DNA {{from various}} treated mice was digested and {{analyzed}} for titanium content. Briefly, prior to elemental analysis, the brain tissues were digested with nitric acid (ultrapure grade) overnight. After adding 0.5 ml H 2 O 2, the mixed solutions were placed at 160 °C with high-pressure reaction containers in an <b>oven</b> chamber <b>until</b> {{the samples were}} completely digested. Then, the solutions were incubated at 120 °C to remove the remaining nitric acid until the solutions were colorless and clear. Finally, the remaining solutions were diluted to 3 ml with 2 % nitric acid. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Elemental X 7, Thermo Electron Co.) {{was used to determine}} the titanium concentration in the samples.

Slurry TS concentrations were determined by drying samples at 45  °C in a vacuum <b>oven</b> (0.6  bar) <b>until</b> repeated weight measurements were constant. Slurry insoluble solid concentrations were determined by a six-step washing and centrifugation procedure [7]. Triplicate measurements were performed on each sample.|$|R
30|$|Tissues {{were taken}} out and thawed. About 0.1 – 0.3 g of each liver tissue and 0.5 mg of liver DNA from various treated mice were weighed, digested, and {{analyzed}} for titanium content. Briefly, prior to elemental analysis, the tissues of interest were digested in nitric acid (ultrapure grade) overnight. After adding 0.5 mL of H 2 O 2, the mixed solutions were heated at about 160 °C using high-pressure reaction container in an <b>oven</b> chamber <b>until</b> the samples were completely digested.

30|$|Plants were {{established}} {{according to the}} trial design on a 5  m by 5  m grid. The bottom of each cutting was bevelled/cut to a point to facilitate planting (approximately 15  cm for poles, 7  cm for wands and 5  cm for stakes). Planting types were “planted” by pushing or ramming the pointed cutting into the soil (3 -m poles to depth of 0.7  m; 1 -m wands to 0.4  m; 0.5 -m stakes to 0.3  m). A “representative” of each planting type of each clone was selected and <b>oven</b> dried <b>until</b> no further loss in weight was detectable to determine an initial value for the above- and below-ground biomass of the planted materials. Biomass was apportioned according to {{the proportion of the}} cutting above- and below-ground of each planting type. Root collar diameter (ground line diameter) and DBH (diameter at breast height over bark – 1.4  m above ground) where applicable, were measured at time of planting.|$|R

5000|$|The 1841 {{artillery}} system listed eight {{types of}} siege artillery and another six types as seacoast artillery. The 1861 Ordnance Manual included eleven {{different kinds of}} siege ordnance. The principal siege weapons in 1861 were the 4.5-inch rifle; 18-, and 24-pounder guns; a 24-pounder howitzer and two types of 8-inch howitzers; and several types of 8- and 10-inch mortars. The normal rate of fire for siege guns and mortars was about twelve rounds per hour, but with a well-drilled crew, this could probably be increased to about twenty rounds per hour. The rate of fire for siege howitzers was somewhat lower, being about eight shots per hour.The carriages for siege guns and howitzers were longer and heavier than field artillery carriages but were similar in construction. The 24-pounder model 1839 was the heaviest piece that could be moved over the roads of the day. Alternate means of transport, such as railroador watercraft, were required to move larger pieces any great distance.The rounds fired by siege artillery were generally {{the same as those}} fired by field artillery, except that siege artillery continued to use grapeshot after it was discontinued in the field artillery (1841). A [...] "stand of grape" [...] consisted of nine iron balls, ranging from two to aboutthree and one-half inches in size depending on the gun caliber.The largest and heaviest artillery pieces in the Civil War era belonged to the seacoast artillery. These large weapons were normally mounted in fixed positions. The 1861 system included five types of columbiads, ranging from 8- to 15-inch; 32- and 42-pounder guns; 8-and 10-inch howitzers; and mortars of 10- and 13-inches.Wartime additions to the Federal seacoast artillery inventory included Parrott rifles, ranging from 6.4-inch to 10-inch (300-pounder). New columbiads, developed by Ordnance LieutenantThomas J. Rodman, included 8-inch, 10-inch, and 15-inch models.The Confederates produced some new seacoast artillery of their ownBrooke rifles in 6.4-inch and 7-inch versions. They also imported weapons from England, including 7- and 8-inch Armstrong rifles, 6.3-tol2.5-inch Blakely rifles, and 5-inch Whitworth rifles.Seacoast artillery fired the same projectiles as siege artillery but with one addition - hot shot. As its name implies, hot shot was solid shot heated in special <b>ovens</b> <b>until</b> red-hot, then carefully loaded and fired as an incendiary round.|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of some {{physical and chemical}} properties was done in order to investigate the effects of storage in hazelnuts, under certain conditions of tempera- ture, relative humidity and packaging. The fruit samples used were original from Spain, Portugal and Turkey. The storage of the nuts lasted for a month and a half, and the conditions tested were: at room temperature; at 30 and 50 C without control over relative humidity of the air; 30 and 50 C with relative humidity of 90 %, refrigeration and freezing. The two types of plastic package tested were low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low density poly- ethylene The water activity was measured by a hygrometer; moisture by <b>oven</b> drying <b>until</b> constant weight, colour with a colorimeter and texture with a texturometer. From the results obtained it was concluded that for a good preservation of the hazelnuts it must be chosen the LDPE type of package and with respect to storage conditions it should be done at room temperature, or alternatively in refrigeration or freezing...|$|R
