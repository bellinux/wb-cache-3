40|$|Interaction {{between the}} meaning of verbs and their {{complementation}} patterns reveals how the language categorizes our event-related concepts. This study focuses on the omission of the preposition from from the complements of negative causative verbs, which represent the nonrealization of a situation expressed by V-ing. Mair (2002) reports the rapid increase <b>of</b> <b>prevent</b> NP V-ing compared with the prevent NP from V-ing variant in British English, while such a change is not observed in American English. Mair mentioned the possibility of semantically similar verbs following the omission of from, but did not test it due to {{the small size of}} the corpora. Using the British National Corpus, this study examines the two complement variants (from and from-less), analyzing the cooccurring verbs (V-ing) and exploring any semantic factors underlying the shift. Occurrences of the from-less variant showed a significantly higher frequency with being passives in the complements <b>of</b> <b>prevent</b> and stop, as well as with verbs of occurrence (happen, arise, occur) in complements <b>of</b> <b>prevent.</b> However other concurrent verbs give no distinction between the two variants <b>of</b> <b>prevent</b> and stop.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} rate, error type, causes and {{clinical}} significance <b>of</b> unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents reported by Welsh National Health Service (NHS) hospital pharmacies. Methods: Details of all unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents occurring over 3 months (September–December 2005) at five district general hospitals across Wales were reported and analysed using a validated method. Rates <b>of</b> unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Reported error types, contributory factors and clinical significance <b>of</b> unprevented and <b>prevented</b> incidents were compared using Fisher's exact test. Key findings: Thirty-five unprevented and 291 prevented dispensing incidents were reported amongst 221 670 items. The rate of unprevented (16 / 100 000 items) and prevented dispensing incidents (131 / 100 000 items; P = 0. 04) was significantly different. There {{was a significant}} difference in the proportions <b>of</b> <b>prevented</b> and unprevented dispensing incidents involving the wrong directions/warnings on the label (prevented, n = 100, 29 %; unprevented, n = 4, 10 %; P = 0. 02) and the wrong drug details on the label (prevented, n = 15, 4 %; unprevented, n = 6, 14 %; P = 0. 01). There {{was a significant difference}} in the proportions <b>of</b> <b>prevented</b> and unprevented dispensing incidents involving supply of the wrong strength (prevented, n = 46, 14 %; unprevented, n = 2, 5 %; P = 0. 02) and issue <b>of</b> expired medicines (<b>prevented,</b> n = 3, 1 %; unprevented, n = 5, 12 %; P = 0. 002). Conclusion: The use <b>of</b> <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents as a surrogate marker for unprevented incidents is questionable. There were significant differences between unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents in terms of rate and error types. This is consistent with the medication error iceberg. Care must be exercised when extrapolating prevented dispensing incident data on error types to unprevented dispensing incidents...|$|R
