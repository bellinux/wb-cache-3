5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. He maintains that the Taliban need to disarm and honor the integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> constitution before they could be considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} efforts made to start inter-religious dialogue, with the Islamist head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Supreme Court. Mullah Fazul Shinwari {{attended}} {{the inauguration of}} the mission and {{expressed a desire to}} meet with the Pope.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was {{under the control of}} the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> General Kalapahad. Following the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was {{under the control of the}} Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E

5|$|Civilian deaths {{caused by}} allied {{operations}} had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who {{were allowed to}} move into the Quam. The residents may have been further dismayed by the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> president, Hamid Karzai, to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and maliks in Kabul two days previously.|$|E
5|$|ISAF was {{initially}} charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, {{so as to}} allow for the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.|$|E
5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack struck {{at the heart}} of American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor. It raised doubts about the reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> forces that are being trained by the United States and its allies, and on the practicality of Western exit strategies that involve training the Afghan army and policy with the aim of enabling them to fight the Taliban on their own.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Constitutional Rights {{reports that}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> repatriated to Afghanistan from April 2007 {{were sent to}} <b>Afghan</b> custody in <b>the</b> American built and {{supervised}} wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul.|$|R
25|$|A member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German {{special forces}} (KSK) {{was killed in}} action and another wounded on June 6, 2013, the first combat losses in that unit's history. <b>The</b> <b>Afghan</b> unit meant to operate {{alongside}} the Germans fled combat twice, raising serious concerns about <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> to stand their ground on their own.|$|R

5|$|On May 3, 2013, the Afghan Green Trend - the {{grassroots}} movement led by Amrullah Saleh - organized a large athletic demonstration in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Security Forces (ANSF). It also aimed at denouncing corruption, {{calling for a}} clean city and a clean municipality. The demonstration passed through the Afghan parliament building. The demonstrators chanted against the parliament's alleged corruption and denounced MPs who take bribes.|$|E
5|$|The first match <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> {{team was}} {{scheduled}} with Iran on September 28 at the Busan Gudeok Stadium. The Iranian team dominated the match, winning by {{a score of}} 10 to 0. Alireza Vahedi Nikbakht scored five goals in the match. This was the largest margin of victory for Iran in the tournament. Iran would win the gold medal after defeating Japan in the final.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard Soldiers {{with the}} 29th ID {{deployed}} to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011.

They {{were part of a}} NATO Coalition of 49 troop-contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|A {{translation}} {{appeared in}} 1836 by Bernhard Dorn which had two parts. There is another partial translation from 1958, Nirodbhusan Roy titled, Niamatullah's History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans.</b> A translation {{in two volumes}} by S. M. Imamuddin appeared in Dhaka, 1960-62.|$|R

5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> government) to stabilize the country.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> people.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Helmand Province {{incident}} was the manslaughter of an injured Taliban insurgent by Alexander Blackman, which occurred on 15 September 2011. Three Royal Marines, known during their trial as Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by court-martial. On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> combatant, in contravention of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This made him the first British soldier to be convicted of a battlefield murder whilst serving abroad since the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Afghan Jews: Records of a Jewish {{population}} in Afghanistan {{go back to}} the 7th century. Before <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> Islam in Kabul, Kabul and Gandhara were trading places for Jewish merchants. <b>The</b> <b>Afghan</b> Jewish community has disappeared since the 1950s due to gradual emigration to Israel. Since the Mughal period, there had also been a historiographical tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> themselves being descended from <b>the</b> Lost Tribes <b>of</b> Israel.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>the</b> Islamic conquest <b>of</b> Afghanistan, <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> {{people were}} multi-religious. The {{majority}} were followers of Hinduism and Buddhism.|$|R
25|$|During <b>the</b> First <b>Afghan</b> War (1839 to 1842) Kemball {{served with}} the Bombay Horse Artillery under Sir John Keane, saw action at <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Ghazni on 23 July 1839, <b>the</b> capture <b>of</b> Kabul that followed, and <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> at Khelat-i-Ghilzai during the {{subsequent}} British retreat to India. From 1842 to 1878 Kemball continued his military career in the Persian Gulf.|$|R
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, was in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Pratap {{were other}} Indians from the Berlin Committee, notably Champakaraman Pillai and the Islamic scholar and Indian {{nationalist}} Maulavi Barkatullah. Barkatullah {{had long been}} associated with the Indian revolutionary movement, having worked with the India House in London and New York from 1903. In 1909, he moved to Japan, where he continued his anti-British activities. Taking the post of Professor of Urdu at Tokyo University, he visited Constantinople in 1911. However, his Tokyo tenure was terminated under diplomatic pressure from Britain. He returned to the United States in 1914, later proceeding to Berlin, where he joined the efforts of the Berlin Committee. Barkatullah had as early as 1895 been acquainted with Nasrullah Khan, the brother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Emir, Habibullah Khan.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1914-1918 war, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} difficult to recruit Hazaras from the Hazarajat; more recruits {{had to be taken}} from the Hazaras colonies settled in the Mashhad area. These men, however, lacked many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hazaras enlisted directly from <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> highlands. <b>The</b> difficulty in obtaining more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter was due chiefly to the change in <b>the</b> attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> towards <b>the</b> Hazaras, who were no longer poorly treated and were now being freely enlisted in <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Army. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> government had requested <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> India to stop enlisting their subjects (the Hazaras) in the Indian Army.|$|R
25|$|As <b>of</b> 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Security Forces (ANSF) {{have been}} in charge of {{security}} in and around the city. Kabul is periodically <b>the</b> scene <b>of</b> deadly suicide bombings carried out by the Haqqani network, <b>the</b> Islamic State <b>of</b> Iraq and <b>the</b> Levant – Khorasan Province, the Taliban's Quetta Shura, Hezbi Islami, al-Qaeda, and other anti-state groups. Government employees, soldiers and ordinary civilians have all been targets <b>of</b> attacks. <b>The</b> <b>Afghan</b> government called <b>the</b> actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrorists war crimes.|$|R
50|$|He {{then spent}} the {{following}} years fighting <b>the</b> <b>Afghans,</b> driving them out of western Punjab, taking opportunity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> being embroiled in civil war. <b>The</b> deposed <b>Afghan</b> king Shah Shuja rallied {{a significant number of}} tribes and received British backing in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sikh army against the Barakzai king Dost Muhammad. The civil war in Afghanistan coupled with a British backed assault meant that the Sikhs could virtually walk into Peshawar. They managed to capture Pashtun territory including Peshawar which was under direct British supervision and control.|$|R
5|$|In fall of 2003, the 45th Infantry Brigade was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, assuming command of Task Force Phoenix II from 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The purpose of the soldiers' deployment was to assist in training Afghan security forces. Over the next few years, soldiers of the 45th Infantry Brigade, including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, would deploy {{in support of this}} mission. In April 2004, 350 soldiers from the brigade's 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment also {{deployed to}} Joint Task Force Phoenix. During this rotation, the brigade grew the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Army to over 14,000 as well as fielding a corps-sized force ahead of schedule. In August 2004, the brigade was replaced in this mission by the 76th Infantry Brigade, and subsequently returned home to the United States. The brigade spent three years back home, and in that time transformed into an infantry brigade combat team {{as a part of a}} new transformation plan for the Army.|$|E
5|$|It {{is alleged}} that Amin became radicalised during his second {{stay in the}} United States in 1962, when he {{enrolled}} in a work-study group at the University of Wisconsin. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the Columbia University Teachers College, but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend Ali Ahmad Popel, a previous Afghan Minister of Education. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised. Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather West Germany and Lebanon. By {{the time he had}} returned to Afghanistan, the Communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran as a candidate for the PDPA in the 1965 parliamentary election, and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E
