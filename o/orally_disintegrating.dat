5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{overcome}} {{the limitation of}} insufficient hardness during the production of rapidly <b>disintegrating</b> <b>orally</b> dispersible tablets (ODTs). Furthermore, we investigated the properties and usefulness of functionalized calcium carbonate (FCC) as a new pharmaceutical excipient {{for the production of}} ODTs. METHODS: A highly sensitive tensiometer-based method was developed to measure kinetics of weight loss during tablet disintegration. With this method we were able to determine the residence time of tablets placed on a basket immersed into a test medium. The shapes of tensiometer plots allowed us to categorize substances into four different types of disintegration. RESULTS: At the same volume and hardness, the tablet formulations with FCC showed a significantly higher porosity (over 60 %) than all other formulations. Residence time depended mainly on the tablet composition rather than on porosity. When combined with disintegrants, FCC formulations exhibited favorable disintegration properties, comparable to those of the marketed drug risperidone oro (disintegration time ca. 10  s). CONCLUSIONS: Oral dosage forms - based on the new pharmaceutical excipient FCC - can be designed to have a short disintegration time combined with good mechanical strength. Due to these properties, FCC can be used for the preparation of ODTs...|$|R

50|$|Rizatriptan (trade name Maxalt) is a 5-HT1 {{receptor}} agonist of the triptan class of drugs developed by Merck & Co. {{for the treatment}} of migraine headaches. It is available in strengths of 5 and 10 mg as tablets and <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablets (Maxalt-MLT).|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, {{eletriptan}} and frovatriptan soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E

50|$|The first ODT {{form of a}} drug to get {{approval}} from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was a Zydis ODT formation of Claritin (loratadine) in December 1996.

The regulatory condition for meeting the definition of an <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablet is USP method 701 for Disintegration. FDA guidance issued in Dec 2008 is that ODT drugs should disintegrate in less than 30 seconds.

5000|$|... 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists {{are very}} effective antiemetics and constitute a great {{advance in the}} management of CINV.

5000|$|An <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablet or orally {{dissolving}} tablet (ODT) {{is a drug}} {{dosage form}} available for a limited range of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications. ODTs differ from traditional tablets {{in that they are}} designed to be dissolved on the tongue rather than swallowed whole. The ODT serves as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) or for where compliance is a known issue and therefore an easier dosage form to take ensures that medication is taken. Common among all age groups, dysphagia is observed in about 35% of the general population, as well as up to 60% of the elderly institutionalized population [...] and 18-22% of all patients in long-term care facilities ODTs also have a faster onset of effects than tablets or capsules, and have the convenience of a tablet that can be taken without water. During the last decade, ODTs have become available in a variety of therapeutic markets, both OTC and by prescription.|$|E
50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} <b>orally</b> <b>disintegrating</b> tablets include loose compression tabletting, {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the die wall. Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as crospovidone, and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate, for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E
