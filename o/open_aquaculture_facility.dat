50|$|Raising {{marine organisms}} under {{controlled}} conditions in exposed, high-energy ocean environments beyond significant coastal influence, {{is a relatively}} new approach to mariculture. <b>Open</b> ocean <b>aquaculture</b> (OOA) uses cages, nets, or long-line arrays that are moored, towed or float freely. Research and commercial <b>open</b> ocean <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> are in operation or under development in Panama, Australia, Chile, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Norway. As of 2004, two commercial open ocean facilities were operating in U.S. waters, raising Threadfin near Hawaii and cobia near Puerto Rico. An operation targeting bigeye tuna recently received final approval. All U.S. commercial facilities are currently sited in waters under state or territorial jurisdiction. The largest deep water open ocean farm in the world is raising cobia 12 km off the northern coast of Panama in highly exposed sites.|$|R

Univariate and multivariate analyses of benthic community measures from box core samples indicated minimal or {{no significant differences between}} impact and reference areas. These findings resulted in development of an adaptive monitoring protocol involving initial low-cost methods that required more intensive and costly efforts only when negative impacts were initially indicated. The continued growth of marine aquaculture is dependent on further development of farming methods that minimize negative environmental impacts, as well as effective monitoring protocols. Adaptive monitoring protocols, such as the one described herein, coupled with mathematical modeling approaches, have the potential to provide effective protection of the environment while minimize monitoring effort and costs...|$|R
50|$|Catfish and baitfish {{aquaculture}} {{have grown}} rapidly since the 1960s, {{particularly in the}} south-eastern United States. <b>Open</b> <b>aquaculture</b> ponds provide winter or year-round homes and food for cormorants on the species' long-established migration route. This has also led to conflict and prompted culling at <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities.</b> Cormorants’ effect on the aquaculture industry is significant, with a dense flock capable of consuming a harvest. Cormorants are estimated to cost the catfish industry in Mississippi alone between $10 million and $25 million annually.|$|R
40|$|Aquaculture, the {{practice}} of farming shellfish, finfish, and plants in water, has existed for thousands of years. In the United States, however, aquaculture has a much shorter history and has only recently been recognized to have significant economic potential. In light of recent dramatic management failures in capture fisheries, leading to collapses of some wild fish populations, many have begun to view aquaculture as an efficient, reliable alternative means to satisfy rising consumer demand for fish and to create new jobs. It is now the fastest growing agricultural sector in the United States. Operators of aquaculture operations in the United States have to date limited their activities to freshwater and near-shore coastal water sites, almost exclusively within both state and federal jurisdictions. As the industry continues to grow, it will likely expand into the open ocean, defined {{for purposes of this}} paper as federal waters in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) lying beyond state waters. State waters are generally defined as extending three miles from shore. The principal reasons for the likely expansion of <b>aquaculture</b> into the <b>open</b> ocean are: (1) to avoid conflicts with other human uses of the sea surface, water column and seabed; (2) to avoid regulation under state laws; (3) to have access to more consistently high water quality; and (4) to minimize regulatory compliance burdens generally by siting facilities where the effluents are more readily dispersed. The major factors currently limiting the expansion of <b>aquaculture</b> into the <b>open</b> ocean include the difficulty and high cost of engineering and building facilities able to withstand the more severe storm conditions encountered in the open ocean, the high cost of operating facilities far from shore, and the absence of a clear and environmentally protective federal regulatory framework. In addition, these factors have apparently made it difficult for developers to attract sufficient investment capital to construct and operate <b>open</b> ocean <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities.</b> This Article reviews the most significant environmental concerns raised by open ocean aquaculture; describes the key elements of the current federal framework of environmental laws regulating aquaculture in federal waters; highlights the deficiencies of this framework, partly by discussing actual <b>open</b> ocean <b>aquaculture</b> proposals; and suggests ways to improve the framework by making it both more protective of the environment and, by reducing uncertainty, less burdensome to <b>open</b> ocean <b>aquaculture</b> developers...|$|R

30|$|Products of {{the fishery}} {{industry}} crucially contribute to world’s nutrition. Since the 1990 s the amount of captured fish has been stagnating while the amount of fish produced in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> has been increasing until today (FAO 2012).

Such incidents pose a major risk for fish farms and can lead to big economic losses. Therefore, the selection and farming of as robust animals as possible that are adapted to local environments can contribute to sustainable regional aquaculture and ensure a balanced economic efficiency of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{optimised}} {{reduction of}} dissolved nutrient loads in aquaculture effluents through bioremediation requires selection of appropriate algal species and strains. The {{objective of the}} current study was to identify target species and strains from the macroalgal genus Ulva for bioremediation of land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Eastern Australia. We surveyed land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> and natural coastal environments across three geographic locations in Eastern Australia to determine which species of Ulva occur naturally in this region and conducted growth trials at three temperature treatments on a subset of samples from each location to determine whether local strains had superior performance under local environmental conditions. DNA barcoding using the markers ITS and tufA identified six species of Ulva, with U. ohnoi being the most common blade species and U. sp. 3 the most common filamentous species. Both species occurred at multiple land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Townsville and Brisbane and multiple strains of each species grew well in culture. Specific growth rates of U. ohnoi and U. sp. 3 were high (over 9 % and 15 % day- 1 respectively) across temperature treatments. Within species, strains of U. ohnoi had higher growth in temperatures corresponding to local conditions, suggesting that strains may be locally adapted. However, across all temperature treatments Townsville strains had the highest growth rates (11. 2 - 20. 4 % day- 1) and Sydney strains had the lowest growth rates (2. 5 - 8. 3 % day- 1). We also found significant differences in growth between strains of U. ohnoi collected from the same geographic location, highlighting the potential to isolate and cultivate fast growing strains. In contrast, there was no clearly identifiable competitive strain of filamentous Ulva, with multiple species and strains having variable performance. The fast growth rates and broad geographical distribution of U. ohnoi make this an ideal species to target for bioremediation activities at land-based <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Eastern Australia. © 2013 Lawton et al...|$|R

40|$|Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) winter {{throughout}} the country of Colombia. Recoveries of banded Ospreys indicate that many are shot {{in the country with}} the number increasing since the 1970 s. The increased incidence of shooting has coincided with the development of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> in Colom- bia that raise tilapia (Oreochromis spp.). Because these facilities typically lose production to birds such as Ospreys that depredate fish, we conducted a survey of 83 facilities in three states or departments in Colombia in 2001 to determine the species of birds that take fish at <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> and the numbers that are killed each year. Our results showed that bird depredation occurs at <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> {{throughout the}} country, but mostly in the southern portion of the country in the department of Huila. Facility managers reported shooting Ospreys in all three departments with as few as five individuals shot annually in Antioquia in northern Colombia to as many as 270 shot annually in Huila.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A {{simulation}} and decision-support {{software product}} for <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facility</b> design and management planning is described (AquaFarm, Oregon State University©), including comprehensive documentation and applications to practical problems. AquaFarm provides (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes, (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management, (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets, and (4) a {{graphical user interface}} and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system, for the analysis and development of facility design specifications and management strategies. Intended user groups include aquaculture research, engineering, education, and production. As guided by the user, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> can be of any type, configuration, and management objectives, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. User-accessible specifications include (1) site climate and water supplies, (2) components and configurations offish culture systems, (3) fish and facility management strategies, (4) unit costs for budget items, (5) production objectives (species, time schedules, and fish numbers and weights), and (6) parameters of unit-process and fish performance models. Based on these specifications, <b>aquaculture</b> <b>facilities</b> are simulated, resource requirements are compiled, and operation schedules are determined so that production objectives are achieved. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, resource and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables.
