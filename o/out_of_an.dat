5|$|A {{number of}} new sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E

Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

By February14, the storm explosively intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds peaking at 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Over the following day, increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the cyclone and by February17, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before being absorbed by Cyclone Olaf.|$|E

With peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) and a minimum pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), Florence was the strongest storm of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. Florence developed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{area of low pressure}} associated with a stalled frontal system located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda in late October.

5|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in {{a period}} of {{rebuilding}} and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> available 491. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and in the next election, the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.|$|E
