40|$|Incorporating <b>optical</b> <b>fibres</b> in {{cochlear}} electrode arrays {{has been}} proposed to provide sensors to help minimise insertion trauma and also for the delivery of light in optical nerve stimulation applications. However, embedding an <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> into an electrode array may change its stiffness properties, which can affect the level of trauma during insertion. This report uses measurements of buckling and deflection force to compare the stiffness properties {{of a range of}} cochlear electrode arrays (Nucleus straight array, rat array, cat array and guinea pig array) with custom arrays containing an embedded <b>optical</b> <b>fibre.</b> The <b>cladding</b> diameters of the <b>optical</b> <b>fibres</b> tested were 125 μm, 80 μm and 50 μm.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the potential sensing applications of fibre Bragg gratings in polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres.</b> Fibre Bragg gratings are fabricated in {{different kinds of}} polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres,</b> including Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and TOPAS cyclic olefin copolymer based microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibres</b> and PMMA based step-index photosensitive polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre,</b> using the 325 nm continuous wave ultraviolet laser and phase mask technique. The thermal response of fabricated microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings has been characterized. The PMMA based single mode microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings exhibit negative non-linear Bragg wavelength shift with temperature, including a quasi-linear region. The thermal sensitivity of such Bragg gratings in the linear region is up to - 97 pm/°C. A permanent shift in the grating wavelength at room temperature is observed when such gratings are heated above a threshold temperature which can be extended by annealing the fibre before grating inscription. The largest positive Bragg wavelength shift with temperature in transmission is observed in TOPAS based few moded microstructured polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings and the measured temperature sensitivity is 250 ± 0. 5 pm/°C. Gluing method is developed to maintain stable optical coupling between PMMA based single mode step index polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings and single mode step index silica <b>optical</b> <b>fibre.</b> Being benefit from this success, polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg gratings are able to be characterised for their temperature, humidity and strain sensitivity, which are - 48. 2 ± 1 pm/°C, 38. 3 ± 0. 5 pm per %RH and 1. 33 ± 0. 04 pm/µ??respectively. These sensitivities have been utilised to achieve several applications. The strain sensitivity of step index polymer <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> Bragg grating devices has been exploited in the potential application of the strain condition monitoring of heavy textiles and when being attached to textile specimens with certain type of adhesives.
