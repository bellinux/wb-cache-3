5|$|After {{leaving the}} Marianas Islands, {{the eye of}} Dolphin became much larger as the storm {{developed}} strong outflow channels, both indicative of further strengthening. On May16, the typhoon began rapid deepening as it reached the western periphery of the ridge, causing it to turn more to the north. At 06:00UTC that day, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Based on the well-defined structure and Dvorak ratings of T7.0, the JTWC upgraded Dolphin to a super typhoon late on May16 with 1minute winds of 260km/h (160mph). The approaching westerlies turned Dolphin {{to the north and}} northeast on May17 while also imparting unfavorable conditions, causing the eye and the convection to elongate and weaken. By May18, increased wind shear had exposed the circulation as the winds continued to drop. After the convection decreased further, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Dolphin on May19, once Dolphin was beginning to become extratropical near the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On the next day, the winds fell below typhoon force, and at 00:00UTC on May21, the JMA declared Dolphin extratropical. The storm accelerated to the northeast, passing through the Aleutian Islands on May22. The storm slowed <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Alaska, turning eastward to cross the International Date Line on May24.|$|E
5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

The electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it, but the electrons cannot. The freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current. The ions {{travel through the}} electrolyte to the cathode. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> cathode, the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical, usually oxygen, to create water or carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|After {{his short}} term stint with Sydney Olympic Bingley rejoined four time Northern NSW NBN State League Champions Hamilton Olympic for the 2007 season. Matthew had a stellar season after {{settling}} into {{the position of}} attacking midfield, which saw him claim the club's golden boot award (seven goals) and named best and fairest. But most importantly, he was {{the driving force behind}} the club claiming its 5th premiership and 1st since 2001, beating rivals Edgeworth. This maintained Hamilton Olympic's perfect record <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Grand Final. He has re-signed for the 2008 season.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{a system}} {{originally}} {{developed in the}} French ITT laboratories was widely used. The ITT team had fled France {{in front of the}} German invasion and destroyed their equipment before leaving. They were able to quickly duplicate their efforts <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> US. This system used a motor to quickly spin a radiogoniometer, as well as providing an input to electronics that spun the X and Y inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This caused the signal to trace out a pattern on the display {{that could be used to}} determine the direction of the transmission almost instantly.|$|E

The Browns' fourth touchdown, a short run by Bob Cowan, came {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland was helped by strong punting from Horace Gillom, who had a 55.7-yard average for the game, including punts of 85 and 80 yards. Graham was taken out of the game in the first half along with most of the team's first-string players. Bud Schwenk substituted at quarterback later in the game, but the team did not score in the second half. Baltimore had two opportunities to score, <b>once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Browns' four-yard line, but the Cleveland defense held.

After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323°. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Lecourbe {{made several}} feints {{on the bridge}} at Dillingheim, but his {{reconnaissance}} suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at Gremsheim, Blindheim and Höchstädt, which he did the next day. [...] A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi-Brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river. [...] After stripping their clothing and weapons, and loading them into a small raft, the naked men swam the river, pulling their weapons on rafts behind them. [...] <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> other side, they took possession of several guns and some ammunition, wood, and materials. [...] Here they held their position until some artillery men managed to scramble across {{the wreck of the}} bridge at Gremsheim and support them. [...] The pioneers and bridge builders reconstructed the bridges under Austrian fire, allowing the remainder of the 94th crossed the river. [...] This accomplishment seemed to mark the turning point of the action, at least it did to Moreau, who mentioned it at length in his dispatch. A full Austrian Corps maintained a stand at Höchstädt, but were dislodged by repeated attacks of carabiners, cuirassiers and hussars, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and Würtembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.|$|E

[...] Except for the Fairview Incline, these originally conveyed horsecars, but were later equipped to carry electric streetcars. [...] The cars would be driven onto the incline platform, which was level and was equipped with rails and (in most cases) overhead trolley wires. The platform, riding on its own rails, would then be pulled up the hill by the cable, carrying the streetcar. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> top, the streetcar could simply be driven off of the platform, onto the fixed-in-place track along city streets. [...] The 1872-opened Mount Adams Incline began carrying horsecars in 1877, and it was later strengthened for use by electric streetcars, which were much heavier.|$|E
2500|$|One 1844 British {{commentary}} on Ashanti tactics claims that they commenced operations by cutting {{a number of}} footpaths in the brush to approach and encircle the enemy force. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> initial jump-off point, Ashanti troops formed in line and attacked. Other accounts compared the Ashanti marching order to that of ants, {{with the use of}} several parallel columns that joined into one general striking force maneuvering before combat. Such a [...] "converging columns" [...] approach was ironically used by the British themselves in fighting the Ashanti, and is a tactic that appeared on the battlefields of Europe under Napoleon, as 'march divided, fight together' was the original raison d'etre of the division. These standardized tactics had often yielded the Ashanti victory. Scouts screened the army as it marched in its columns, then withdrew as the enemy became close. Upon the beginning of combat, the advance guard moved up in 2 or 3 lines, discharged its muskets and paused to reload. The second line would then advance to fire and reload, A third rear line would then repeat the advance – fire-reload cycle. This [...] "rolling fire" [...] tactic was repeated until the advance halted. Flanking units would be dispatched as part of the fire and maneuver model.|$|E
