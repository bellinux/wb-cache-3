500|$|Republican {{leaders had}} heard that Borah was an {{attorney}} for corporations, who had prosecuted labor leaders; they believed him sympathetic to their Old Guard positions and assigned him to important committees. [...] In fact, Borah believed in the rights of unions, {{so long as they}} did not commit violent acts. When Borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing-in, Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, hoped to put pressure on him through the Westerner's corporate clients, only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to Washington. Borah became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> of progressive Republicans in the Senate. Yet, Borah often opposed liberal legislation, finding fault with it or fearing it would increase the power of the federal government. Throughout his years in the Senate, in which he would serve until his death in 1940, his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer.|$|E

40|$|Most games have, {{or can be}} {{generalised}} to have, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> parameters {{that may}} be varied {{in order to provide}} instances of games that lead to very different player experiences. The space of possible parameter settings {{can be seen as a}} search space, and we can therefore use a Random Mutation Hill Climbing algorithm or other search methods to find the parameter settings that induce the best games. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function. In this paper we explore the possibility <b>of</b> using <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> set <b>of</b> General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.

40|$|Enabling {{students}} to understand the processes of systems analysis and design is a challenge facing all MIS educators. While the concepts and details are covered thoroughly in texts, it remains difficult to convey the big picture of the de-velopment process. Due {{in part to the}} inherent complexity of the subject and the relative absence of introductory-level experiential exercises, beginning MIS students often struggle to understand concepts well enough to apply them in later courses and in the field. Learning theorists such as Bloom and Kolb, however, underscore the importance of experiential learning to developing mastery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subject. The current work applies these theories to teaching information systems analysis and design in general, and then presents a Lego-based classroom activity to begin to fill the need for early experiential learning in an introductory analysis and design course. Whether students are beginning to learn the field or already have some back-ground, the Lego-based activity is a rich metaphor for the entire systems development process. Students can use the lessons from this activity as they progress through the course and beyond. The activity is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> suite <b>of</b> similar Lego-based activities that has been used for five years at the Universit...|$|R

Specifically, the study looked at the peer group's ideal of "the popular girl" and girls' individual perceptions of and reactions to it. Subjects completed measures of self concept (PCSC), sex role attributes (CSRI), sex role attitudes (AWSA), and <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> projective questions, and then participated in an intervention, in which a control group read from a mainstream teenage girls' fashion magazine, and an experimental group read from Blue Jean, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> genre <b>of</b> girl-centered, advertising-free magazines for teenage girls. The original measures were then adminstered again. It was predicted that subjects in the experimental condition would demonstrate more confidence and resistance to cultural stereotypes about women than they had exhibited earlier, and that subjects in the experimental condition would show little change. While the intervention produced only <b>a</b> handful <b>of</b> significant effects, the results are suggestive of the potential benefits to adolescent girls of programs designed to support their integrity and creative resistance to damaging cultural messages...|$|R

This dispute featured allegations that India’s import measures applied against avian influenza (AI) infected countries over poultry and related products were too restrictive, in light of the World Organisation for Animal Health’s (OIE’s) scientifically-motivated standards and guidelines. We rely on insights from <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> economic models of commercial poultry markets in the presence of negative externalities such as AI. We use such models to motivate critical tradeoffs arising {{at the intersection of}} government regulatory regimes designed to deal with AI, and how they fit alongside trade agreements such as the WTO and standard-setting bodies such as the OIE, which combine to impose constraints on regulatory and trade policy. While we find the institutional design of the OIE to be well-motivated and we are in broad agreement with the overall thrust of the Panel Report in the dispute, we also highlight <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> subtle issues which pose long-term challenges for the multilateral trading system’s ability to balance trade rules with public health concerns...|$|R
