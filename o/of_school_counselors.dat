The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> K-12.|$|E

2500|$|The rate of {{job growth}} and {{earnings}} {{for school counselors}} depends on the country that one is employed in and how the school is funded—public or independent. School counselors working in international schools or [...] "American" [...] schools globally may find similar work environments and expectations to the USA. School counselor pay varies based on school counselor roles, identity, expectations, and legal and certification requirements and expectations of each country. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), the median salary for school counselors in the USA in 2010 was (USD) $53,380 or $25.67 hourly.

40|$|Before <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> {{can carry}} out the duties and {{responsibilities}} outlined as part <b>of</b> a comprehensive <b>school</b> counseling program, they must know which students {{they are responsible for}} helping. The topic of assigning students to <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> has only recently been seen in the educational research arena in a study by Akos, Schuldt, and Walendin (2009). The current study attempts to replicate and extend the findings of Akos, Schuldt, and Walendin by addressing the questions <b>of</b> how secondary <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> are assigned and what are their perceptions of their assignment. In addition, the study attempts to determine whether a particular type <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment is more effective in enhancing student achievement in a large school district. A review of literature relevant to this study includes: the history <b>of</b> <b>school</b> counseling; the role <b>of</b> the <b>school</b> counselor; student achievement as defined by NCLB (2001); <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> interventions in the areas of standardized-test scores, attendance, and graduation rates; and <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment. The study was conducted in two parts. Part one of the study was conducted using a survey questionnaire [...] <b>School</b> <b>Counselor</b> Assignment Questionnaire, SCAQ (Akos, Schuldt, and Walendin, 2009). A total <b>of</b> 213 secondary <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> from Clark County School District participated in the survey. The results found that the breakdown <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment used in participating secondary schools was similar to that found by Akos, Schuldt, and Walendin (2009) with a majority <b>of</b> middle <b>schools</b> using a grade level looping method and a majority <b>of</b> high <b>schools</b> using an alphabetical method. Also evident in {{the findings of this study}} was that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> using methods <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment in which they keep the same students from year to year, had more positive perceptions of their method than those who were using a mixed method. Part two of the study is an analysis of student achievement data from schools using different <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment methods. Results of this analysis show no significant difference between <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment and the student achievement variables [...] percentage of students who meet or exceed standards on the standards-based reading test, percentage of students who meet or exceed standards on the standards-based math test, and student daily average attendance. At the middle school level there was a difference related to method of assignment in the student achievement variables, but extended analysis suggested this was an artifact of extraneous variables. Although the findings of this study do not identify a relationship between <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment and the three NCLB variables representing student achievement, it does further the findings of the original study by showing statistically significant differences in counselor perceptions of several aspects <b>of</b> their <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> assignment method.
