5|$|As good fluids are {{supposed}} to be transferable, the Antoinist dress used during the worship is often placed on the bed of a suffering person to help his recovery; similarly, some faithful put a request <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> in a box under the platform so that the wish happen, others buy a photo of Antoine at a ceremony to be protected. To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple, several rules were established: for example, those who perform the worship are not allowed to wear jewelry or makeup in the building.|$|E

5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E

The construction could be carried on two wooden poles. A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in Athanasius Kircher's influential book Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae.|$|E

The weekly newspaper was published every Friday from 1914 to 1970. Lathers had paid subscribers in 38 states. Sometime after 1916 and before 1919 the News name was changed to Newz on the suggestion from a subscriber to add more flair.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the three Americans' system for telegraphy, which {{was first used}} in about 1844, was {{designed}} to make indentations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> tape when electric currents were received. Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a paper tape. When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving paper tape, making an indentation on the tape. When the current was interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus, and {{that portion of the}} moving tape remained unmarked.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} telegraph is {{a derivative}} of the electrical telegraph which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by electrical wire representing {{a letter of}} the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver would then receive the instantly readable text of the message <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> strip. This {{is in contrast to}} the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted into readable text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in common use, namely along the United States east coast and in France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl House of Rockland, Vermont.|$|E
