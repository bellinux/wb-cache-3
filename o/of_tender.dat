5|$|The {{original}} design <b>of</b> <b>tender,</b> {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E

As he demands that Almirena be set free, Armida finds herself drawn to his noble spirit, and declares her love. When he angrily rejects her she uses her powers to assume Almirena's form, but Rinaldo suspects trickery, and departs. Armida, resuming her own appearance, is furious at her rejection yet retains feelings <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> love. She decides on another attempt to ensnare Rinaldo, and transforms herself back into Almirena's shape, but then encounters Argante. Believing her to be Almirena, Argante repeats his earlier promises of love and freedom. Swiftly resuming her own form, Armida denounces his infidelity and vows vengeance.

40|$|Uncertainty {{about the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> has led to {{research}} being conducted to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> within the Australian construction industry. This has involved reviewing work done in Australia and overseas as well as exploring the efforts within the construction industry to collect cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> information. While there is currently awareness of the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and that efforts {{should be taken to}} minimise this cost, there is little precise understanding of it in terms of value or how it happens. This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R

The next step was to conduct a questionnaire survey to ascertain the extent to which ethical behaviour in tendering is supported and practised in Australia. This showed that most companies support the use codes <b>of</b> <b>tendering,</b> defend the right <b>of</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>tenders,</b> disapprove <b>of</b> bid shopping, cover pricing and union involvement in the tendering process, support the principals' right to know what is included in a tender and the self-regulation <b>of</b> the <b>tendering</b> codes. In addition, most companies have developed, and follow, idiosyncratic ethical guidelines that are independent of, and often contrary to, the nationally prescribed codes. The major conclusion is that a more empirical approach to the development of future ethical prescriptions in the field is needed...|$|R

Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal seems to be to completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the caseworker and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends a dashboard figurine (<b>of</b> <b>Tender)</b> into Adam's eye.

25|$|So {{far there}} is limited planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} water in Morocco, given that only 21% of the collected wastewater undergoes any treatment. In 2009 {{there were more than}} 100 wastewater treatment plants in Morocco, mostly serving small and medium-sized towns located in the interior or the country. The first wastewater treatment plants in Morocco were built by small municipalities using a wide range of technologies. Because of the limited financial and technical capacities of those municipalities practically all of these 28 plants ceased functioning shortly after they were completed. This triggered a decision in 2000 to gradually transfer the responsibility for sanitation in small and medium-sized towns to the national utility ONEP. In 2009 the latter has built or {{was in the process of}} building 43 plants, mostly using the stabilization pond technology, but also one activated sludge plant and a few trickling filter plants. The track record of operating these plants is better than for the plants operated by municipalities, partly because the predominant technology - stabilization ponds - does not require electricity. Its lower operating costs make it less vulnerable to disruptions in the case of strained operating budgets. In larger cities, only very few municipal utilities (Régies) operate wastewater treatment plants. Their track record at operating them is mixed: A plant operated by the Agadir utility works well, while plants operated by the utilities of Beni Mellal and Nador do not function. These plants use the activated sludge technology which requires electricity. The Marakkech utility was constructing a large plant in 2009, and the Fes utility was in the process of bidding for a plant. This process experienced a setback when the French development agency AFD and the European Investment Bank withdrew their financing for the plant, citing non-respect <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> procedures as the reason.|$|E
