5|$|The CASA 2.111 {{was another}} Spanish-built {{version of a}} German aircraft, the Heinkel He 111, that was adapted to use the Merlin after the supply of Junkers Jumo 211F-2 engines ran <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the war. A similar {{situation}} existed with the Fiat G.59 when available stocks of the Italian licence-built version of the Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine ran short.|$|E
5|$|With time in {{the quarter}} running out, Virginia Tech fielded the post-score kickoff and {{executed}} a quick series of plays, gaining a first down before time ran <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the first quarter, Auburn held an early 6–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|After Tech's kickoff, Air Force went {{three and}} out {{and was forced to}} punt. The Hokies took over at their 34-yard line after the kick. Bryan Randall {{completed}} two quick passes to wide receiver Shawn Witten for a total of 26yards before time in the quarter ran <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the first quarter, Air Force had a 10–7 lead, but Virginia Tech was in possession of the ball and driving deeper into Air Force territory.|$|E

5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E
5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. Capper {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane work should be stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of March 1909.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of July.|$|E

I got some thin sewing machine leather belting, plaited it into a neat ring, {{submitted}} it, and had it accepted. I called it a Woggle and that’s the name it’s known by throughout the world.|$|R
5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{returned}} to the castle from Leicester in September, where another 600 Royalist soldiers soon joined him and its 60 man garrison, carrying out raids on Parliamentary convoys and the garrison at Coleorton. Plague broke <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the year, forcing the besiegers to retreat to Leicester, while the garrison temporarily abandoned the castle buildings and occupied the neighbouring park. Once the epidemic passed, Parliament began to raid the town and Henry worked through Ferdinando to agree the surrender of the castle on good terms: this was achieved in February 1646, and allowed {{for the release of}} himself, the garrison and their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Previous guest actors William Mapother, Julie Bowen, M.C. Gainey, Brett Cullen, and John Terry made brief {{appearances}} in the episode. The premiere marked the first appearances of recurring guest actors Blake Bashoff and Stephen Semel. In addition to Mitchell's new billing, only four other characters of star billing appeared in the episode: Michael Emerson, depicting Ben Linus, was promoted to a main character for the third season; the other three were Matthew Fox playing Jack Shephard, Evangeline Lilly as Kate Austen and Josh Holloway as Sawyer. Henry Ian Cusick was also promoted to a main character as Desmond Hume, along with new characters Nikki and Paulo, played by Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro respectively. Malcolm David Kelley (Walt Lloyd), Harold Perrineau (Michael Dawson), Michelle Rodriguez (Ana Lucia Cortez), and Cynthia Watros (Libby) were no longer credited as main characters after each of their characters were written <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the previous season.|$|E

5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn <b>out,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of a long}} and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E

5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold <b>out.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> the match ended with a draw (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 of their fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day.|$|E
5|$|The war {{had also}} led to {{political}} tensions, revolution and turmoil. In Russia, the conflict resulted in revolution and civil war between 1917 and 1923, and the rise to power of the Communist Bolshevik government. The German Empire had seen revolution break <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the war, with vicious street fighting in the major cities, including Berlin; some Germans felt that this experience was too quickly forgotten in the post-war years. Romania almost descended into revolution as well. There was turmoil in Ireland; 210,000 Irish served in the war {{as part of the}} British forces, but the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 led in turn to the Irish War of Independence and the later civil war. Elsewhere the war exposed simmering ethnic and religious divisions. In Canada, for example, the distinctions between the English, largely Protestant, and French speaking, predominantly Catholic, parts of the country become increasingly apparent, with conscription becoming a major political issue.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E
