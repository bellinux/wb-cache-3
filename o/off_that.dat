5|$|On 28 September 2005, the Pentagon {{formally}} approved full-rate {{production for}} the V-22, with planned rate increase from 11 {{a year to}} between 24 and 48 a year by 2012. Of the 458 total planned, 360 are for the U.S. Marine Corps, 50 for the Air Force, and 48 for the Navy at an average cost of $110 million per aircraft, including development costs. The V-22 had an incremental flyaway cost of $67 million per aircraft in 2008, The U.S. Navy had hoped to shave about $10 million <b>off</b> <b>that</b> cost after a five-year production contract in 2013. The cost for each CV-22 was $73 million in the FY 2014 budget.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped <b>off</b> <b>that</b> {{there was a}} spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found {{it increasingly difficult to}} gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E
5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing <b>off</b> <b>that</b> escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E

5|$|Nedvěd {{made his}} league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1–0 away defeat against Bologna. He scored his first league {{goal for the}} club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996, {{finishing}} the 1996–97 season with seven goals. He became {{an integral part of}} the side, scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997–98 season. The club had a 24-match unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998, ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedvěd was sent <b>off.</b> <b>That</b> season, Lazio won the 1997–98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Nedvěd and Lazio began the 1998–99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana, Nedvěd scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2–1. He played a role in Lazio's road to the last-ever Cup Winners' Cup, scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio's 7–0 aggregate quarter-final victory over Panionios. In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, Nedvěd scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio's 2–1 win. This proved to be the last goal of the tournament, which was later discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained <b>off</b> <b>that</b> committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|The storm slowly {{strengthened}} {{over the}} warm {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm. However, a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished. The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and leveled <b>off</b> <b>that</b> evening at just under hurricane intensity. On the morning of September 16, the storm began to develop a ragged eye, and the storm strengthened to hurricane status. The intensity leveled off for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane, as the intensification was slowed {{by the presence of}} moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air. Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 {{as the system}} continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning. The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm. Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop. That morning, a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds. The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm leveled <b>off</b> <b>that</b> afternoon as upper-level wind shear increased substantially due {{to the presence of}} a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough. The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72mph (115km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening. Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category1 hurricane based on data from the reconnaissance flight late on September 26and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP <b>off</b> <b>that</b> ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E
