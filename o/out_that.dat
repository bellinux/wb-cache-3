5|$|Franklin points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the {{resources needed to}} pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction.

Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
