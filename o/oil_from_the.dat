30|$|Ribeiro et al. ([2008]) {{evidenced}} a {{yield of}} approximately 0.97 % for <b>the</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> leaves and stem barks from D. brasiliensis. Previously, Limberger et al.

Gomes et al. ([2013]) found, {{for the same}} species, a yield of approximately 0.3 % for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> fresh leaves.|$|R
25|$|Steam distillation: Steam from {{boiling water}} is {{passed through the}} raw material, which drives out their {{volatile}} fragrant compounds. <b>The</b> condensate <b>from</b> distillation are settled in a Florentine flask. This allows for the easy separation of <b>the</b> fragrant <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> water collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> raw material is called hydrosol and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as flowers, leaves, and stems.|$|R

40|$|The {{compositions}} of <b>the</b> essential <b>oils</b> isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{aerial parts}} of 11 populations of Thymus caespititius {{collected during the}} flowering phase on Pico, Faial and Graciosa (Azores) were studied by GC and GC-MS. The monoterpene fraction was dominant in all the oils analysed (55 - 90 %) and consisted mainly of oxygen-containing compounds (44 - 79 %). Sesquiterpenes represented an important fraction of <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> populations grown on Graciosa (13 - 28 %). In contrast, this fraction was rather small in <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> populations grown on Pico and Faial (6 - 11 %). Despite this, oxygen-containing compounds (4 - 18 %) were always dominant. Cluster analysis of all identified oil components grouped the oils into three main clusters that corresponded with their main components. <b>The</b> <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 11 populations studied showed a clear chemical polymorphism that, in some cases, was more evident among populations growing on the same island than among those from different islands.
