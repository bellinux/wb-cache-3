40|$|A lined {{pipeline}} {{consists of}} an outer main load-bearing pipe of Carbon-Manganese steel, termed backing steel, and an inner corrosion resistant alloy layer, termed liner. The purpose of the liner is {{to serve as a}} membrane; protect the backing steel from the sour contents owing inside and thus prevent internally corrosion. The main challenge of lined pipelines arise because of its low bending capacity due to local buckling of the liner, termed wrinkling. In installation as well as in operation, the pipeline will be exposed to bending and wrinkling of the liner may occur if the imposed curvature is su cient. Based on previous work in a joint industry project[5], nite element basis for mechanical behaviour of lined pipelines in installation and operation have been developed in present the project. Di erent parameters that in uence the wrin- kling phenomena in installation have been studied. The nite element model - established in the present task - is able to predict the post-buckling behaviour of the liner. This open the possibility to determine a limiting bending strain/cur- vature on lined pipelines based on wrinkling height. The wrinkling behaviour during operational phase is brie y discussed.

The surface strain-sensing stations {{are to be}} evenly distributed along each span-wise strain-sensing line. A depth-wise {{cross section of the}} structure along each strain-sensing line can then be considered as an imaginary embedded beam. The embedded beam was first evenly divided into multiple small domains with domain junctures matching the strain-sensing stations. The new method is comprised of two steps. The first step is to determine the structure stiffness (bending or torsion) using surface strains obtained from a simple bending (or torsion) loading case, for which the applied bending moment (or torque) is known. The second step is to use the strain-determined structural stiffness (bending or torsion), and a new set of surface strains induced by any other loading case to calculate the associated <b>operational</b> <b>loads</b> (bending moments, shear loads, or torques).

40|$|Accelerating Moving Walkways (AMWs) are {{conveyor}} systems that accelerate pedestrians {{from a low}} speed {{at the entrance to}} a higher speed at the middle section, and then decelerate them to a low speed again at the exit. It is envisaged they can be a potential transport mode to fill the gap between short and moderate distance transport. However, present day AMWs are still relatively short, so there is no knowledge on the application and performance of these systems for longer distances. In comparison, long bulk material belt conveyors have been utilized for many years. Their application is made possible due to the distribution of power along the belt conveyor. Because moving walkways and belt conveyors have some similarities in their mechanism, the experience in developing long bulk material belt conveyors can be taken as analogy for developing long AMWs. Nevertheless, the two systems have different characteristics related to their different application and load, one for people and the other for bulk materials. This thesis aims to investigate the possibility of applying AMWs for moderate distance continuous people transport. In approaching this main research objective, we distinguish three main elements in the application of AMWs, i. e. the system itself, the passengers, and the location. The characteristics of each element and their interactions are analysed with respect to how they impose requirements and boundaries towards the application of AMWs, in general and in particular for moderate distance transport.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} {{to be addressed in}} the design of marine propeller blade. Among these, the foremost is the efficiency of the propeller. The design of ship propeller involves a number of competing variables including the rake, pitch distribution and blade surface area. The propeller design also aims at achieving high propulsive efficiency at low levels of noise and vibration with reduced cavitation. All of these factors affect vessels top speed, fuel efficiency, and handling. A thorough understanding of propeller dynamics is necessary to design an efficient and reliable propeller blade. Numerical models are commonly used for the dynamic characterization of propeller blades, due to the difficulties of performing full-scale measurements. In contrast, the current research focuses on the hydrodynamic design of a Wageningen B-series four bladed propeller used for marine applications. The analyses presented in this thesis have been divided into three main phases. In the first phase, the hydrodynamic design of Wageningen B-series four bladed marine propeller is carried out, to determine the suitability and applicability of propeller blade for underwater conditions is done by 1) Open water characteristics determination, 2) Cavitation inception point determination for metallic propeller blade. The prevailing conditions applied for evaluating these hydrodynamic characteristics are taken from reference and validated with standard series data. In {{the second phase of the}} research, Strength determination of both metallic and composite propeller (E-glass epoxy material) are determined in terms of its stress and free vibration characteristics. Numerical analyses are carried out using suitable numerical methods for the deflection calculations and to determine the stress distribution in the blade foot and the blades at <b>operational</b> <b>load</b> <b>conditions.</b> A modal vibrational analysis for prediction of vibration response was also conducted for the blade, because the composite blades tend to deform more than that of metallic one and the deformation can be used in the analysis of hydrodynamic performance. Experiments are performed to compare the results with that obtained from the numerical analysis. In the last phase Structural optimization of composite propeller was done both for non-hybrid and hybrid composites, (comprises a series of combination of Glass fiber reinforced plastic and Carbon reinforced plastic GFRP & CFRP), using the mid-surface as reference and meshed with shell elements to find out the optimum ply stacking sequence for Interlaminar shear stresses and deflection minimization and operational efficiency improvement of composite propeller blade compared to metallic one. The obtained final stacking sequence of the composite propeller was evaluated by varying the number of layers in steps the Interlaminar shear stresses are calculated, and the results are compared with the metallic propeller. The following basic data are used for analysis and the main points performed during the works are given below. 1. 	The open water characteristics are predicted computationally on the basis of a validated small sized propeller where the delivered power (PD), the advanced coefficient (Vga), and the propeller revolution (N) are known. 2.

To maintain minimum forecasting error under various operational scenarios, the FBTFS adaptation was optimised using a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPANN), which was trained using Backpropagation algorithm, based on the information about the amount of error and the operational conditions at time of forecasting. For the sake of comparison and performance testing, this mechanism was added to the conventional forecasting methods, i. e. Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous-Artificial Neural Network (NARXANN), Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering Method-based Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (FSCMANFIS) and Gaussian-kernel Support Vector Machine (GSVM), and the measured forecasting error reduction average in a 12 month simulation period was 7. 83 %, 8. 5 % and 8. 32 % respectively. The 3. 5 MW variable load profile of Edith Cowan University (ECU) in Joondalup, Australia, was used in the modelling and simulations of this model, and the data was provided by Western Power, the transmission and distribution company of the state of Western Australia...|$|R
