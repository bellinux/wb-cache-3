Research among layer farms in the Netherlands and other EU countries has shown that <b>organic</b> <b>eggs</b> contain more dioxin than conventional ones and {{that a significant number}} of <b>organic</b> farms produce <b>eggs</b> with a dioxin content that exceeds the EU standard. The hens' intake of dioxins from various sources leads to an increase in the dioxin content of <b>organic</b> <b>eggs.</b> These sources include plants, feed, soil, worms and insects, and compared with hens on conventional and free-range farms, organic hens make more use of these sources due to better access to the outdoor run. Plants appear to be relatively unimportant as a source of dioxins. Also commercial organic feed generally has very low dioxin contents, but not much is known about non-commercial feed. Consumption of worms and insects and particularly ingestion of soil are important causes of high dioxin levels in eggs.

40|$|White (Lohmann LSL) and Brown (ATAK-S) laying hens, were reared under {{organic and}} {{conventional}} cage rearing systems, {{and the effects}} of the rearing system on performance parameters, egg production, egg characteristics, and immune response were investigated. For this purpose, a total of 832 laying hens of two commercial hybrids, i. e., 416 white (Lohmann LSL) and 416 Brown (ATAK-S) layers, were used. The experiment lasted between 23 and 70 wk of age. In this study, the white layers yielded more eggs as compared to the brown layers in both organic and conventional production systems. Egg weight exhibited a similar pattern to that of laying performance. However, the total hen-housed egg number for the white birds in the organic system was fewer than that of white birds in the conventional cage facility; conversely, a contradictory tendency was observed for the brown birds. Livability of the white layers in the organic system was remarkably lower (14 %) than that of the brown line, whereas the white line survived better (3. 42 %) than their brown counterparts in conventional cages. The feed conversion ratio of the white hens was markedly inferior in the organic system as compared to that of the white hens in the conventional system, whereas relatively lower deterioration was reported in brown layers when reared in an organic system. The organic production system increased egg albumen height and the Haugh unit in eggs of the brown layers. The yolk color score of <b>organic</b> <b>eggs</b> was lower than that of conventional eggs for both brown and white hens. The egg yolk ratio of eggs from white layers was found to be higher in <b>organic</b> <b>eggs</b> as compared to those obtained in the conventional system.

40|$|A {{decade ago}} the <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> {{production}} in Sweden was nearly nonexistent (Föreningen för ekologisk fjäderfäproduktion, 2008).

Today, the <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production composes roughly 6 % of the total egg production in Sweden. This indicates that the ambition of Jordbruksverket, which has an <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production goal of 10 % of the total production, is not yet achieved.

40|$|Animal {{health and}} welfare is an {{important}} part of the organic husbandry, both in terms of the organic principles and because of consumer interest. But problems in the <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production resulting in diseases, feather pecking and cannibalism, have led to the need of management tools in order to secure animal {{health and welfare}}. The aim of this project is to develop management tools for the <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production, aimed to secure animal health and welfare in the flocks. In the first part of the project a welfare assessment system for <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production was developed and tested on five farms, having a total of ten flocks. The ten flocks were monitored regularly for a number of production and welfare parameters in order to evaluate the practical applicability of the welfare assessment system. A welfare assessment report was created and presented for each pro¬ducer, and the welfare assessment system was evaluated with respect to its function as a decision support tool. In addition two welfare indicators were studied separately to evaluate variability and interpretation. Adjustments for the welfare assessment system were suggested, in order to improve collected data, presentation and the practical applicability of the system. In the second part of the project the first part of a HACCP system was developed, using an expert panel analysis. Eighteen experts received a series of questionnaires, where the construction of each questionnaire was based upon the answers of the former. By quantifying the experts’ opinions, ten health and welfare problems were selected, and associated risk factors and control points identified. A generic HACCP system was described together with the possibilities of evaluating the system and possibilities of a practical application. The two management tools have very different approaches to improving animal health and welfare, and subsequently different methods, cost and advantages. This makes them relevant for different purposes and by different producers and interested parties. The thesis includes four papers describing the development of the welfare assessment system (pa¬per I), and evaluation of two welfare indicators included in the welfare indicator protocol (paper II and II). Finally the development of the HACCP-like system is described in paper IV: paper I: Hegelund, L., Sørensen, J. T. & Johansen, N. F.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to assess the potential to reduce the integral ecological impact (i. e. impact along the egg production chain per kg egg) of Dutch <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production by replacing currently used imported diet ingredients with Dutch diet ingredients. We realized this objective by comparing the life cycle assessments (LCA) of current Dutch <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production, i. e. base situation (B) with different scenarios. In each scenario, one imported diet ingredient was replaced with a diet ingredient produced in the Netherlands. Finally, we formulated a scenario in which several ingredients, that individually resulted in the lowest mean change in ecological impact along the <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production chain, were replaced simultaneously. We included differences between production chains in cultivation (i. e. field operation, manure application and yield), transport, feed intake, egg production and N excretion. Replacement of Ukrainian wheat with Dutch triticale, and of Brazilian soybeans, Italian sunflower seed expeller and German peas with Dutch rapeseed expeller reduced the integral ecological impact compared with current <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> production. Simultaneous replacement of these ingredients (scenario MU) resulted in an overall lower and more balanced reduction of the different ecological impacts (41 – 101 %) than single replacement of these ingredients (41 – 215 %). Compared with B ecological impact of scenario MU decreased for global warming potential (91 %), energy use (79 %), land occupation (68 %), acidification potential (99 %), N deficit (85 %), P deficit (41 %) and P surplus (81 %), but slightly increased for N surplus (101 %). The low ecological impact of MU was explained by (1) a relative small increase in feed conversion ratio (from 2. 32 for B to 2. 37 for MU), (2) a reduction of the transport distance of 44. 4 % of the diet ingredients, (3) replacement of the currently used crops with crops that have a higher yield in combination with a balanced applied amount of N and P in manure, and (4) use of expeller instead of whole ingredients...|$|E

A further 52 brands of New Zealand eggs were sampled from supermarket shelves in 2008 (18), 2010 (30), and 2014 (4) to characterize and monitor changes in caged, barn, free range, and <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> farming regimens. Stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes of 49 commercial poultry feeds and their corresponding egg albumens reveals that Dutch poultry are fed exclusively on a plant-based feed and {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> farming regimens in The Netherlands. Similarly, it is possible to discriminate between New Zealand organic and conventional egg farming regimens, although in the initial screening in 2008, results showed that some organic eggs had isotope values similar to those of conventional eggs, suggesting hens were not exclusively receiving an organic diet. Dutch and New Zealand egg regimens were shown to have a low isotopic correlation between both countries, because of different poultry feed compositions. In New Zealand, both conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> whites have higher δ 15 N values than corresponding Dutch egg whites, due to the use of fishmeal or meat and bone meal (MBM), which is banned in European countries. This study suggests that stable isotopes (specifically nitrogen) show particular promise as a screening and authentication tool for organically farmed eggs. Criteria to assess truthfulness in labeling of organic eggs were developed, and we propose that Dutch <b>organic</b> <b>egg</b> whites should have a minimum δ 15 N value of 4. 8 ‰ to account for an organic plant derived diet.
