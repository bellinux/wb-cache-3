5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained {{the ages of the}} characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the New York area, Washington founded a company producing kerosene gas mantles. At this time, they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City. This business was abandoned with the maturation of incandescent light bulb technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants.|$|E

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|German {{submarines}} {{and surface}} warships sortied {{to attack the}} Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels.

In addition, No.455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel. No.460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at Le Havre and Boulogne on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses.

Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority.

5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
