40|$|AbstractAccording to {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} in-situ stress <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> and classic curves of hydraulic fracturing test in coal, this paper obtained typical analytic curves of hydraulic fracturing test. With the tested wells in southern Qinshui basin as research objective, the in-situ stress {{was measured in}} coal seam. Analysis and study of the hydraulic fracturing test data by log-log method and square root method were carried out to obtain the accurate in-situ stress <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> reservoir. The mutual verification of two methods was applied. The stress test data <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> reservoir are <b>of</b> great significance for exploration, test and subsequent extraction <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane operation. ...|$|R

5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> Long distance supplies <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E

The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{description}} of desorption stages <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane {{is an important}} basis to objectively understand the production <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane well, to diagnose the production state, and to optimize the management of draining and collection <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane. A series of isothermal adsorption experiments were carried out with 12 anthracite samples from 6 coalbed methane wells located {{in the south of}} the Qinshui Basin, {{based on the results of}} isothermal adsorption experiments, and an analytical model was developed based on the Langmuir sorption theory. With the model, a numerical method that adopts equivalent desorption rate and its curve was established, which can be used to characterize the staged desorption <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane. According to the experimental and numerical characterizations, three key pressure points determined by the equivalent desorption rate curvature that defines pressure-declining desorption stage, have been proposed and confirmed, namely, start-up pressure, transition pressure and sensitive pressure. By using these three key pressure points, the process <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane desorption associated with isothermal adsorption experiments can be divided into four stages, i. e., zero desorption stage, slow desorption stage, transition desorption stage, and sensitive desorption stage. According to analogy analysis, there are differences and similarities between the processes <b>of</b> <b>coalbed</b> methane desorption identified by isothermal adsorption experiments and observed in gas production. Moreover, it has been found that larger Langmuir volume and ratio of Langmuir constants are beneficial to earlier advent of steady production stage, whereas it is also possible that the declining production stage may occur ahead of schedule...|$|R
