25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face),</b> and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

However he later became better known as a director, with films such as Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and The Stepford Wives (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: “I {{was one of the people}} attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub. Of course, I couldn't take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me.” ...|$|E

500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> too.|$|E

Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street".

500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an aircraft mechanic, but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer thought he looked [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights {{to make up for}} it. Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned that he would be allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> sir!" [...] So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out £15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E

500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just smiled at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> The other kid, I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you feel your fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have to say this is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E

Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on Friday night in an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: [...] "You catch me at a time where I have a smile <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> because of our internal results".

2500|$|Mackerras {{has been}} a regular {{commentator}} on Australian elections in print, {{on radio and television}} on most federal and state elections.

The election analyst who makes predictions is far more interesting than one who doesn't. And if I collect egg <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> then so be it." [...] An example of an incorrect prediction was one he made in The Australian of 1 November 2004. [...] Mackerras said that John Kerry would defeat George W.

2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time.

2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} the {{four members of}} the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I would have something to show my relatives, because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E

60|$|And, indeed, {{the sudden}} fear and consternation written <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lord's <b>face</b> was so plain that all might read it.

He betrayed himself at every step, if not positively, by incautious words, why then by the utter lack of control he had upon his countenance.|$|R
2500|$|For their {{concert at}} the Challenge Stadium in Perth, Sandra Bahbah (The Sunday Times) stated. [...] "There is not one person who will dispute that The Backstreet Boys are as corny as a {{heart-shaped}} box of chocolates on Valentine's Day, but like that item, they are a sweet treat. [...] Their boy band dance moves were impressive but definitely giggle-worthy as one could only describe them as over the top. [...] They had four female back-up dancers {{to help with the}} evening's entertainment and more costume changes than a Beyonce concert, but by gosh it was fun to watch." [...] Rebecca Barry (The New Zealand Herald) did not think highly of the band's performance at Auckland's Vector Arena. She wrote, [...] "The band still rely on their old stable of choreographed white-man manoeuvres: it's raining <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> the lawn mower, side-scissor robot shuffle – and Carter's fans' favourite, slowly-remove-jacket-to-show-off-newly-sculpted-arms.

Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
