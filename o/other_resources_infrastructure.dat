40|$|This article {{examines}} the effectiveness of instructional technology in higher education institutions {{in relation to the}} role and usage of Information Communication Technology (ICT), its effectiveness in faculty teaching and its impact on student learning in universities in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. This study applied the Need Assessment Approach (NAA). A self-designed questionnaire, that employed benchmarks from similar studies conducted in the West, was used to collect data for this study. One hundred and twenty five (n = 125) respondents participated in the study. The results suggest that there are significant relationships between the impact of instructional technology, the usage of instructional technology and students’ academic achievement. An absence of ICT instructional materials, ineffective policy implementation and a lack of <b>other</b> <b>resources</b> (<b>infrastructures)</b> to aid teaching and learning are responsible for short comings in the effective implementation of ICT in education. The study revealed that experience makes it easier to employ and exhibit greater proficiency when using ICT instructional material in the teaching and learning process. The findings and nature of this study bare implications for higher education administrators, faculty and researchers. By design, this research was based on a narrow field of literature and a small sample size. Consequently, it is recommended that further studies are based on a more widespread survey of literature and a larger sample size, which might also involve multiple case studies...|$|R

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{posed by}} future computer architectures is the efficient exploitation of their many and sometimes heterogeneous computational cores. This challenge {{is exacerbated by}} the multiple facilities for data movement and sharing across cores resident on such platforms. To {{answer the question of}} how systems software should treat heterogeneous resources, this dissertation describes an approach that (1) creates a common manageable pool for all the resources present in the platform, and then (2) provides virtual machines (VMs) with multiple `personalities', flexibly mapped to and efficiently run on the heterogeneous underlying hardware. A VM's personality is its execution context on the different types of available processing resources usable by the VM. We provide mechanisms for making such platforms manageable and evaluate coordinated scheduling policies for mapping different VM personalities on heterogeneous hardware. Towards that end, this dissertation contributes technologies that include (1) restructuring hypervisor and system functions to create high performance environments that enable flexibility of execution and data sharing, (2) scheduling and <b>other</b> <b>resource</b> management <b>infrastructure</b> for supporting diverse application needs and heterogeneous platform characteristics, and (3) hypervisor level policies to permit efficient and coordinated resource usage and sharing. Experimental evaluations on multiple heterogeneous platforms, like one comprised of x 86 -based cores with attached NVIDIA accelerators and others with asymmetric elements on chip, demonstrate the utility of the approach and its ability to efficiently host diverse applications and resource management methods.
