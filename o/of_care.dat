5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>care</b> work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>care</b> workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
40|$|Click on the DOI link below {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Caring has been {{described}} as the essence of nursing and some theorists assert that caring occurs only on the interpersonal level. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate caring beyond the individual to communities. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> explicated from a case study were matched with concepts <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> defined in the literature. The concepts <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> were modified through a reevaluation <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> based on the findings from a community case study. Findings suggest concepts <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> as (1) a moral imperative, (2) an affect, (3) a personal interaction, and (4) an action, can be found at the community level. Modification of the original patterns <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> included broadening the concepts to include community interaction and preparatory caring action. peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{learning}} <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> {{occurs when}} appropriate discussion, analysis, and examples are woven into a structured and guided program of practising the art <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> Teaching caring includes nurturing the student's {{perception of the}} patient's need for caring, the opportunities for caring, and the benefits <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> It also includes helping the student to acquire effective methods <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> However, the most important component <b>of</b> teaching <b>caring</b> is helping the student to choose to be <b>caring.</b> The concept <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> as “trying to help love grow” can have a profoundly motivating and integrating effect on the physician's practice <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> Many <b>of</b> the strategies we use to help love grow in our patients we can also use in a modified form to help medical students {{at all levels of}} training. We can also use them to help practising physicians, maintain and expand their capacity to care for and about their patients...|$|R
40|$|This study {{illuminates}} {{the interactions between}} chronically ill people and their family caregivers. The perspective of the caregivers is examined. Caregivers safeguard the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> their relatives often for many years. Their need of social support is still unrecognised. In particular {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about the experience <b>of</b> family <b>caring</b> relationships and their arrangement from the perspective of the participants. This knowledge is essential to improve nursing interventions. A phenomenological approach was chosen for this inquiry. Semistructured interviews with 15 elderly caregivers were conducted and analysed. The key concept of the analysis is the engaged work <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> As a typical form <b>of</b> coping with <b>caring</b> needs in families the engaged work <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> has a momentum, which is addressed as logic <b>of</b> familiy <b>care.</b> This logic is based on three structuring elements: the attitude <b>of</b> <b>caring,</b> the caring activities and the emotional experience <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> Depending on how these elements are formed, a rather supportive or burdening momentum develops. The analysis of the findings of this study gives important advice for a conception of counseling of caregivers...|$|R

5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level <b>of</b> <b>care</b> provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> but a level (or intensity) <b>of</b> <b>care</b> provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

40|$|The work titled "Rank <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> {{persons in}} the context of the social {{services}} law" analyses the situation <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> persons during the care.

The rank <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> persons is not legally embedded in any legal regulation. However, this results into the fact, that there is neither range of duties nor the law or social benefits in the case of sickness, and the old age pension scheme is very limited, too. This work brings suggestions of measures and solutions of these problems so that family and intergeneration solidarity and rules of subsidiarity would be supported, and at the same time the social and economic discrimination <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> persons in the Czech Republic...|$|R

This paper presents a study which described the construct <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> as experienced by students in pre-registration programmes at two universities in New South Wales, Australia.

From the analysis of the data a model <b>of</b> professional nurse <b>caring</b> from the student's perspective was created. In this model, compassion, as the core <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> is actualized in the students' nursing of patients by communicating, providing comfort, being competent, being committed, having conscience, being confident and being courageous.

5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels <b>of</b> <b>care</b> provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change.

40|$|Background: The {{main body}} of {{literature}} investigating experiences <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for a spouse with dementia has focussed on the experiences of receiving a diagnosis and on caring {{in the early stages}} of the disorder. The current study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for a spouse at home in rural areas with moderate to severe dementia. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with five participants who were caring for their partner at home in rural areas with moderate to severe dementia. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: The analysis produced four superordinate themes; changes in the spousal relationship, the demands <b>of</b> <b>caring,</b> managing the demands and unmet needs. Conclusion: Participants’ accounts illustrated the complexity <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for someone with moderate to severe dementia and the psychological and practical resources that are required in order to be able to continue to do so. Participants reflected on specific details of their romantic relationships, aspects of their situation and sources of support which facilitated them with the challenging task <b>of</b> <b>caring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that caring {{is the heart of}} nursing, there is growing {{evidence}} that nurses are not as effective as they ought to be in their caring role.
