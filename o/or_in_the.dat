5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E

Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{case of a}} two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites.

5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E
