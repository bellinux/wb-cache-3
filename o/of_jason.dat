5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death <b>of</b> <b>Jason,</b> at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} {{appearance of}} Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of Medea's brother. In the myth <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> and the Argonauts, as they journeyed home, Medea killed {{her brother and}} dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.|$|E

5|$|Jason Voorhees first appears {{during a}} {{nightmare}} {{of the main}} character Alice (Adrienne King) in the original Friday the 13th film; he becomes the main antagonist of the series in its sequels. As well as the films, there have been books and comics that have either expanded the universe <b>of</b> <b>Jason,</b> or been based on a minor aspect of him.|$|E
5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E
5|$|The Friday the 13th novella storyline was not {{connected}} to the Jason X series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> in its own way. Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in Friday the 13th: Hell Lake. In Hate-Kill-Repeat, two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that {{the three of them}} share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In The Jason Strain, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in Carnival of Maniacs. Pamela is in search <b>of</b> <b>Jason,</b> who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could {{build their own}} Jason statuette. The kit required the owner to cut and paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a new model kit for Jason Goes to Hell. Both kits are now out of production. McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2002. The first was a figure <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> from Jason Goes to Hell, and the other was of Über-Jason from Jason X. Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue <b>of</b> <b>Jason,</b> based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} sign coveted free agents Deron Williams and Steve Nash, the Mavericks {{retooled}} their roster by letting go <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> Kidd, Jason Terry and Brendan Haywood, and acquiring younger {{players such as}} O.

5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E

In terms of sheer mass, it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds.|$|E
5|$|In Greek {{literature}} {{he first}} {{appears as a}} great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, {{but there is no}} extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win at the Glass Bowl. Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth on a pair <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> Pace touchdowns. The first came on a nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due to having the tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands <b>of</b> <b>Jason,</b> making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder <b>of</b> <b>Jason</b> Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E
