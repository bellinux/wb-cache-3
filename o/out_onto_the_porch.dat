2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents. She described the man as a 5'9-10 white man about 40 or 45 years old, about 150 to 155pounds, with dark hair, and was in bad need of a shave. He carried an open, five-inch bladed pocket knife and was wearing gloves, a faded and worn blue shirt with khakis, and had an old, dirty, dark-colored flopped hat.|$|E

50|$|The downstairs {{consisted}} of a parlor, dining room, central hallway, and two bedrooms. Both the parlor and the front bedroom had French doors that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> upstairs had four small bedrooms, each with a dormer. Classical wood columns supported <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> roof, and a white picket fence surrounded the house.

50|$|Fenestration is {{irregular}} due to {{the many}} asymmetrical elements of the house form. On the west (front) facade many of the windows are set with nine-over-one double-hung sash windows; the exception is a wide one-over-one south of the main entrance, looking <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> and one-over-ones in the gabled projection {{at the north end}} of the attic and the shed dormer window that pierces the center of that section of roof between the gabled projection and a gambreled dormer. An oriel window projects from the center of the second story. It has an arched window surrounded by classical detailing, a wide frieze with garlands and swag on top and brackets on the bottom. Scroll brackets support the roof on the north and south ends.|$|E
5000|$|The Desert Sessions {{began in}} August 1997 at the Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree when Homme brought {{together}} musicians from the bands Monster Magnet, Goatsnake, earthlings?, Kyuss (his own band, which had split in 1995) and Soundgarden.The ranch {{is an old}} house filled {{to the brim with}} rare and unique recording equipment and instruments and was owned by Dave Catching and the late Fred Drake. Songs are written [...] "on the spot", often in a matter of hours. Many stories have grown around the Sessions. For example, the song [...] "Creosote" [...] from Volumes 9 & 10 was written by Dean Ween and Alain Johannes on the ranch's front porch within four minutes of meeting each other. Similarly, Chris Goss and PJ Harvey wrote the song [...] "There Will Never Be A Better Time" [...] for I See You Hearin' Me after going <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the ranch for four minutes with an acoustic guitar; they re-entered the house and recorded the song in one take, the only time the song was ever played by the collective.|$|E
50|$|After that incident, {{the narrator}} {{describes}} {{a party that}} he and Patti hold for all of Patti’s employees.

All the girls are dancing with other girls, but the narrator dances with a girl named Donna. Sheila is the first person to get drunk and pass out. The narrator and Patti move Sheila’s sleeping body <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and they forget about her. The party winds down and the narrator makes attempts to have sex with Donna. Donna tells him not now and she leaves the party. Sheila wakes up and walks into the house. After complaining, she asks the narrator where Patti is and that Patti has {{to take her to the}} hospital. The narrator says that Patti is asleep and he kicks Sheila out of the house. The next morning Patti asks the narrator where Sheila is and he tells her that she went to Portland. Patti complains of dreaming of vitamins and that her life is becoming consumed by vitamins.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} two architectural {{features that are}} unique to this area and time period. First {{the exterior of the}} house appears to be made of stone. The planners employed a technique that George Washington had used at Mount Vernon to transform wood to the look of stone. Second is the front entrance to the house which has a uniquely hexagon shaped vestibule with French doors opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> doorway is flanked on each side by an angled side panel. It is believed the original panel contained partial glass.|$|R
