5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory <b>of</b> <b>Literature</b> describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E

Its success has been credited as introducing European literary scholarship into the US and crystallizing a movement towards intrinsic literary criticism. Theory <b>of</b> <b>Literature</b> saw three editions and has been translated into more than twenty languages.|$|E

Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E
