5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{could no}} longer depend on Egyptian troops to hold Greece. The {{strategic}} situation now resembled that existing before 1825 and the landing of Ibrahim Pasha. Then, the Greek insurgents had triumphed <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The same period, when a {{battered}} Byzantium defended itself against enemies <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> {{also saw the}} emergence of a new, unexpected threat: the Rus' made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a raid against Paphlagonia in the 830s, followed by a major expedition in 860.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts</b> and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
50|$|The various Marder IIs {{produced}} fought <b>on</b> <b>all</b> European <b>fronts</b> of the war, however, {{there was}} a large concentration of these on the Eastern Front.|$|R
50|$|However, {{although}} this redeployment had been initiated, {{it was not}} due to be completed until September, and hence the Kwantung Army {{were in the middle}} of redeployment when the Soviets launched their attack simultaneously <b>on</b> <b>all</b> three <b>fronts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between the 1956 {{war and the}} 1967 war, Israeli {{civilian}} and military casualties <b>on</b> <b>all</b> Arab <b>fronts,</b> inflicted by regular and irregular forces (including those of Palestinian fedayeen), averaged one per month — an estimated total of 132 fatalities.|$|R
5|$|Once the Stuka {{became too}} {{vulnerable}} to fighter opposition <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> {{work was done}} to develop a replacement. None of the dedicated close-support designs {{on the drawing board}} progressed far due to the impact of the war and technological difficulties. So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version. The Fw 190F started to replace the Ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the Ju 87 continued {{to be used as a}} night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|With Germany {{suffering}} major defeat <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his ring}} of conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, {{establish a new}} government and save the country from total destruction. On 20 July 1944, during a military conference at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb underneath Hitler's conference table and then quickly left, claiming {{he had to make}} an important telephone call. Shortly after, the bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and the stenographer, who died shorty thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944, the {{situation}} <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts</b> rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.|$|E
50|$|The various Marder IIIs fought <b>on</b> <b>all</b> European <b>fronts</b> and North Africa, {{with the}} Sd. Kfz. 139 being used mainly at the Eastern Front, though some also fought in Tunisia. In February 1945, some 350 Ausf. M {{were still in}} service.|$|R
40|$|Full-scale fuel {{consumption}} and drag tests {{were performed on}} a conventional cab-over-engine tractor-trailer combination and {{a version of the}} same vehicle with significant forebody modifications. The modified configuration had greatly increased radii <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>front</b> corners and edges of the tractor and a smooth fairing of the modified tractor top and sides extending to the trailer. Concurrent highway testing of the two configurations showed that the modified design used 20 % to 24 % less fuel than the baseline configuration at 88. 5 km/hr (55 mph) with near-calm wind conditions. Coastdown test results showed that the modified configuration reduced the drag coefficient by 0. 43 from the baseline value of 1. 17 at 88. 5 km/hr (55 mph) in calm wind conditions...|$|R
50|$|The first {{assigned}} aircraft were Dornier Do 17E and 17M bombers. On 1 August 1939 the Do-17s {{were replaced}} by the Heinkel 111, and the unit was designated as Kampfgeschwader 51. During World War II, this unit saw combat <b>on</b> <b>all</b> war <b>fronts.</b> Landsberg, meanwhile, was utilized primarily for pre-flying and general training.|$|R
5|$|Later during World War II, with Germany {{suffering}} major defeat <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his fellow}} conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, establish a new government and save Germany from total destruction. Stauffenberg had his opportunity on 20 July 1944 at a military briefing at Hitler's East Prussian headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze). He managed to get through security and plant a briefcase bomb under the conference table. The bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and a stenographer who died shortly thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the bomb blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan {{lost the}} {{critical}} Battle of Midway, and Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943, {{with a series}} of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts.</b> In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} forced them back <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts.</b> On 16 September, however, 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines, and North Korean strong points existed on {{the heights of}} Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san. Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear. He therefore believed {{that the key to}} the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry on the left and the 35th Infantry on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved.|$|E
50|$|After the {{development}} of the Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II for mounting the sIG 33, Alkett designed a version mounting a 10.5 cm leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2 field howitzer in an open-topped superstructure. This was Germany's only widely produced self-propelled 105 mm howitzer. Between February 1943 and June 1944, 676 were built by FAMO, and it served <b>on</b> <b>all</b> major <b>fronts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet {{was strong}} enough to deter an outright attack by the Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts</b> and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, {{the siege}} of Nicaea was the high-water-mark of the post-718 Umayyad raids; never again would Umayyad armies {{penetrate}} as deeply into Asia Minor. Increasingly thereafter the Syro-Jaziran army, that provided the manpower for the raids against Byzantium, was diverted in the hard and fruitless wars against the Khazars in the Caucasus: the Khazars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Muslims in 730, and a Byzantine–Khazar alliance was sealed by the marriage of Leo III's son and heir Constantine V (r. 741–775) with the Khazar princess Irene shortly after. Over the next few years, while Byzantine strength revived, the Muslim military situation <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts</b> of the over-extended Caliphate deteriorated. Consequently, in the 730s, Arab raids were mostly limited to the immediate frontier regions and their successes became fewer. By 740, when the Umayyads assembled the largest invasion force fielded after 718, the Byzantines had recovered enough to inflict a heavy defeat against them at the Battle of Akroinon.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, Byzantium revived its {{fortunes}} under Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) and {{his successors}} Leo VI (r. 886–912) and Constantine VII (r. 913–959), {{members of the}} Macedonian dynasty. Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces. The military was reorganised, which allowed the emperors John I (r. 969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025) to expand the frontiers of the empire <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts.</b> The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning, {{a process known as}} the Macedonian Renaissance. Writers such as John Geometres (fl. early 10th century) composed new hymns, poems, and other works. Missionary efforts by both Eastern and Western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians, Bulgars, Bohemians, Poles, Magyars, and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus'. These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples—the states of Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kievan Rus'. Bulgaria, which was founded around 680, at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea. By 1018, the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|At its heyday, the Commonwealth {{comprised}} the territories of present-day Poland, and {{large parts of}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia. It was engaged in the struggles along most of its borders, with only the Western border with the lands of the Holy Roman Empire being relatively peaceful. In its first decades, major conflicts included the Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, the interventions in Moldavia, the Danzig rebellion, and the War against Sigismund. Early 17th century saw {{a number of the}} Polish–Swedish wars, the Polish–Ottoman Wars, and the Polish–Russian Wars (Dymitriads, the Smolensk War). The Commonwealth also suffered from a number of Cossacks uprisings, culminating in the devastating Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648. That period also saw some of the Commonwealth's most talented military commanders: Stanisław Żółkiewski (1547-1620), Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1560-1621), Stanisław Koniecpolski (1593-1646) and Stefan Czarniecki (1599-1665). The Commonwealth managed to hold its weight in most of those conflicts, and scored a number of major victories <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> such as the battle of Kircholm, the battle of Klushino, and had briefly garrisoned Moscow. However, the Chmielnicki Uprising, together with the Russo-Polish War and the Swedish Deluge, all taking place around the same period of the 1650s, proved devastating for the country, resulting in a loss of most of Ukraine to Russia in the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. In 1683 the Commonwealth scored its last major victory that resounded on the European scene, the relief of Vienna by king John III Sobieski. During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly during the Great Northern War. By the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies (the War of the Bar Confederation) led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers. The final attempts to preserve independence of the Commonwealth, including the political reforms of the Great Sejm, eventually failed on the military front, with the Commonwealth defeats in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, ultimately ending in Poland's final partition and the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

25|$|The {{victories}} of 1861 {{were followed}} {{by a series of}} defeats east and west in early 1862. To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts,</b> costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.|$|E
25|$|As April 1945 {{came to an}} end, the German Army Group C, {{retreating}} <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fronts</b> {{and having}} lost most of its fighting strength, was left with little option but surrender. General Heinrich von Vietinghoff, who had taken command of Army Group C after Albert Kesselring had been transferred to become Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front (OB West) in March 1945, signed the instrument of surrender {{on behalf of the}} German armies in Italy on 29 April, formally bringing hostilities to an end on 2 May 1945.|$|E
50|$|After the {{development}} of the Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II for mounting the sIG 33, Alkett designed a version mounting a 10.5 cm leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2 field howitzer in a built-up superstructure.
