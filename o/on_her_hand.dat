For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of her hands being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring {{his face in the}} process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|On August 21, 1940, Trotsky {{was assassinated}} in Coyoacán, where he had {{continued}} to live after leaving La Casa Azul. Kahlo was briefly suspected of being involved, as she knew the murderer, and was arrested and held for two days with her sister Cristina. The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Her continuously fragile health had been in increasing decline since her divorce and was exacerbated by her heavy consumption of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The group {{returns to}} the arena still in full-dive where Kirito, now OS's top-ranked player, dispatches the bosses with his new sword as Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the server room of Argus (the defunct company that ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' {{memories}} and fades out of existence since she was coded from the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill their promise they made {{to each other in}} Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together. Asuna returns Kirito's engagement ring so to properly put it <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> which he does.|$|E
25|$|As for {{distinguishing}} features, Bella {{has a small}} crescent-shaped scar <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{where she}} was bitten by James, a tracker vampire, in Twilight. The scar is described as being pale, always a few degrees colder {{than the rest of}} her body, and it shines like a vampire's skin when exposed to the sunlight. After Bella is changed into a vampire by Edward, she becomes extremely beautiful with even paler skin, straight waist-length hair, and crimson red eyes that will eventually turn gold after months of drinking animal blood. Her features are also heightened and perfected by the transformation.|$|E
50|$|The Hand in the Glove (British title Crime <b>on</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Hands)</b> is a Dol Bonner mystery {{novel by}} Rex Stout. It was first {{published}} by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., in 1937, and later in paperback by Dell as mapback #177 and, later, by other publishers. Collins Crime Club published the novel in the UK in November 1939 as Crime <b>on</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Hands.</b>|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the medical}} {{treatment}} {{she had received}} in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954. She also experienced pain in her legs, while the infection <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> had become chronic, and she also underwent treatment for syphilis. In addition, {{the death of her}} father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression. Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the center of her world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of the hall is a large open square, above which is a domed ceiling about 10 feet in {{diameter}} and 6 feet deep. At the top is a lotus bud with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva carved on it. At the bottom of the dome is a series of friezes with the Ramayana story. On the capitals of the four pillars are madanikas (Salabhanjika). One represents dancing Saraswati, the Hindu god of knowledge, arts and music. The others are regular dancers, but with different expressions. One is dressing her hair, the other in a Natya posture, and the fourth has a parrot seated <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> The head and neck jewelry made of rock are freely mounted and can be moved. The bracelets similarly are moveable. The design of the celing follows the Hindu texts, and is a modified utksipta style with images placed in concentric rings.|$|E
25|$|At {{her first}} tournament of the clay season, the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, No.-1-seeded Radwańska {{defeated}} Andrea Petkovic and Karolína Plíšková for the 7th and 6th time respectively. In the semifinal she lost to German qualifier Laura Siegemund who upset Simona Halep and Roberta Vinci {{on her way}} to the final. Serena Williams' withdrawal from the Madrid Open (tennis) elevated Radwańska to top seed of the tournament. She lost to Dominika Cibulkova in the first round. At Roland Garros, No.2-seeded Radwańska defeated Bojana Jovanovski, Caroline Garcia and Barbora Strýcová before losing to Tsvetana Pironkova. Radwańska's fourth-round match against Pironkova was contested over three days due to harsh rainy conditions. Radwańska led the encounter prior to the resumption of the match in the rain. However while playing in the rain she dropped ten consecutive games, got treatment from a trainer <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and subsequently ended up losing the match in three sets. While avoiding major injury during the match, Radwańska needed treatment to her hand the following day.|$|E

25|$|New France {{had been}} conquered by the British in 1760 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War and was under the {{administration}} of the British Army at this time. On hearing the rumours the local British military authorities charged with keeping order set up an inquiry into Dodier's death. The inquiry opened in Quebec City on March 29, 1763, at the Ursulines of Quebec, charging Joseph Corriveau and his daughter Marie-Josephte, before a military tribunal made up of 12 English officers and presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Roger Morris. The case ended, on 9 April, with Joseph Corriveau being sentenced to death, for culpable homicide of his son-in-law. Marie-Josephte was found to be an accomplice to murder, and sentenced to sixty lashes and branded with the letter M <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> One of Joseph Corriveau's nieces, Isabelle Sylvain (who he employed as a servant), had testified but changed her story several times during the hearing; she was found guilty of perjury and given thirty lashes and branded with the letter P.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in May 2008 and {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It premiered on 16 September 2008. It starts out with Lewis receiving a text message from her boyfriend saying he is just a minute away from meeting up with her. The video then turns into a dream-like sequence with Lewis dancing in four set-ups inspired by the Hollywood musicals West Side Story, The Rocky Horror Show, Singin' in the Rain and Carousel. The video ends with Lewis coming back to reality after a drop of rain lands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and her boyfriend sent a message saying [...] "Hurry! Looks like there could be rain". The Jabbawockeez dance crew also make an appearance in the Rocky Horror scene in the video, dancing behind Lewis.|$|E
500|$|A.C. Bradley notes that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance [...] "denied the dignity of verse." [...] According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections – the blood <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> the striking of the clock, her husband's reluctance – are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's [...] "brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth" [...] with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a [...] "desolating misery." [...] Lady Macbeth's compulsive washing of her hands to rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Jackie Gleason in How Do I Love Thee?. During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she wanted no part of it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death.|$|E

2500|$|In Homer's epic works, Athena's {{most common}} epithet is Glaukopis (...) , which usually is {{translated}} as, [...] "bright-eyed" [...] or [...] "with gleaming eyes". The word {{is a combination}} of glaukós ( [...] , meaning [...] "gleaming, silvery", and later, [...] "bluish-green" [...] or [...] "gray") and ṓps ( [...] , [...] "eye, face"). The word glaúx ( [...] , [...] "little owl") is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. Athena was clearly associated with the owl from very early on; in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an owl perched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|Just before Thanksgiving 1983, {{complications}} from {{a blood clot}} forced her to have her leg amputated. When {{she returned to the}} show in April 1984, her character's life mirrored her own. [...] After visiting Aunt Meta in New York, Bert returned to Springfield and began experiencing pain in her leg (which had been fitted with a prosthesis by this time and mostly kept off camera). [...] She ended up having her leg amputated just as the actress who played her had. For the first time in decades, Bert had to depend upon others to wait <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and foot, resulting in one of the series' most memorable stories. (Bert, sitting in a wheelchair at Cedars Hospital, told Josh Lewis, who had been paralyzed recently and had given up hope, that life itself was a miracle and never to forget it.) In a moving scene, Bauer dropped a teacup. She tried to get it, but could not, and in sheer frustration, she burst into tears. [...] As she went through rehab following her operation, camera shot closed in on her remaining leg as she learned to walk again, bringing even more realism to the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|In Kalamazoo, {{with cold}} weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ {{managers}} agreed {{to play the}} Game 2 in just seven innings. Risinger started for the Chicks and pitched {{one of the best}} games of her career. Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters. Nevertheless, she lost her control temporarily and issued back-to-back walks to Schroeder and Peppas. With the bases loaded, Woody English {{was on the verge of}} yanking Risinger, but he instead sent Ziegler to the pitching mound. Pulling off her glove, the [...] Ziegler looked up at the tall Risinger. Okay, Beansie, can you get her out? she asked. Blowing <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to keep her fingers warm against the fast-chilling night, the pitcher replied, I don't know Ziggy. Snapping the brim of her cap in place, the diminutive Ziegler energetically ordered, Well do it! As a result, Risinger faced the dangerous Sams and struck out her on three straight fastballs. She fanned nine Lassies batters and walked four in completing her pitching gem.|$|E
