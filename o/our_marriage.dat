500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> should be a mutual exchange.|$|E

After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human.

She was considered too short and the role went to actress Nia Long. Jada and Will became friends, and began dating in 1995. On December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Regarding her marriage, Jada said that they are [...] "private people" [...] and told one interviewer, [...] "I will throw my career away before I let it break up <b>our</b> <b>marriage.</b> I made it clear to Will. I'd throw it away completely".|$|E
500|$|Brown and {{his wife}} Phyllis {{separated}} in August 1995. Phyllis filed for divorce in Kentucky in 1996, but withdrew the petition amid settlement talks with her husband. After Brown reportedly cut off much of his wife's financial support, she filed a second divorce petition in 1997, this time in Broward County, Florida where her husband was living at the time. After a brief legal fight over whether the proceedings should take place in Kentucky or Florida, the divorce became final in 1998. Later that year, he married former Mrs. Kentucky Jill Louise Roach, 27 years his junior, but they divorced in 2003 for reasons not released. When asked why they divorced he stated [...] "I do have great love for Jill, but something which cannot be overlooked has come up in <b>our</b> <b>marriage.</b> I will always love her and her children, but it seems a divorce is our only option now." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{seems quite}} {{unlikely}} that that problem could have offered difficulties to any but a trained philosopher. Nearly any {{person would have}} said to M. Bourget: [...] "Oh, that is very simple.

After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was married}} five times: he married actress Sally Gracie (1952–1958), actress Claire Bloom (1959–1969), {{secretary}} Sherry Nelson (1973–1979), singer Paula Ellis (1986–1997) and actress Joan Benedict Steiger (married 2000 until his death). He had a daughter, opera singer Anna Steiger (born in 1960) by Bloom, and a son, Michael Steiger (born in 1993), from {{his marriage to}} Ellis. In an interview with journalist Kenneth Passingham, Steiger stated that Bloom was [...] "all I ever wanted in a woman", and that [...] "maybe <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> was better than most because we were both established when we met". The couple bought a home in Malibu, California, a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring. They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in County Galway, {{in close proximity to}} John Huston's home. Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid-1970s. It upset him greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer Hillard Elkins the same year, a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting Waterloo. Steiger was also close friends with actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally mixed reception from critics. The {{day after the}} premiere, Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune wrote that while it was [...] "not the laugh riot The Simpsons have spoiled us to expect – our appetite for showbiz parodies is waning – the episode did have its moments." [...] He further added that he especially liked [...] "the sign posted outside the movie studio gate: 'No Artistic Integrity Beyond This Point.'" [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing that [...] "Gibson actually {{does a good job}} here, and it’s amusing to see Homer’s terrible movie ideas. This isn’t classic Simpsons, but it starts the season on a pretty good note." [...] However, an article in Salon magazine from 2000 points to [...] "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] as the greatest precursor to that Homer would be more predominant as “Jerkass Homer” in the Scully era as showrunner, a Homer who [...] "is not only dumb, but [...] disgusting and semi-sociopathic. This is the Homer who, in the season opener , showed Marge's wedding ring to Mel Gibson and stated, 'This is a symbol that as per <b>our</b> <b>marriage,</b> she's my property and I own her.'" [...] Gibson's performance has generally been praised. Simon Crerar of The Times listed his performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Similarly, Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Gibson's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history in a list of twenty people, calling it [...] "Another ace self-effacing appearance from a Hollywood high-flyer".|$|E

"I {{think the}} {{explanation}} is," [...] replied the Minor Poet, [...] "that as regards, let us say, {{the most natural}} business of <b>our</b> life, <b>marriage,</b> <b>our</b> natural instincts alone are brought into play.

2500|$|Prince Naruhito, in May 2004, criticised the then-Grand Steward of the Imperial Household, Toshio Yuasa, {{for putting}} {{pressure}} on Princess Masako, Naruhito's wife, to bear a male child.

60|$|If any man {{consider}} the present aspects {{of what is}} called by distinction society, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force and do lean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, <b>our</b> occupations, <b>our</b> <b>marriages,</b> <b>our</b> religion we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlor soldiers.

In a joint statement, the Gibsons declared, [...] "Throughout <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> and separation we have always strived to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family {{and will continue to}} do so." [...] The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to show him on a beach embracing Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} William IV, {{who had been}} his godfather when Duke of Clarence, had George brought up at Windsor in hope of his eventual marriage to his cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, who was two months younger. This prospective match was favoured by George's own parents, but was forestalled by her uncle Leopold I of Belgium. He secured Victoria's betrothal to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which became formal after she succeeded to the British throne. In 1839 Queen Victoria wrote to Albert about George's father: [...] "The Duke told Lord Melbourne he had always greatly desired <b>our</b> <b>marriage,</b> and never thought of George: but that I don't believe." [...] George {{was one of a}} range of suitors considered by Victoria, the most prominent of whom, Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, was openly favoured by William.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} it you, sir," [...] said his dragoman: [...] "The English have a genius for taking {{the shadow of a}} thing for its substance. 'So long,' they say, 'as <b>our</b> <b>marriages,</b> <b>our</b> virtue, our honesty, and {{happiness}} seem to be, they are.' So long, therefore, as we do not dissolve a marriage it remains virtuous, honest and happy though the parties to it may be unfaithful, untruthful, and in misery. It would be regarded as awful, sir, for marriage to depend on mutual liking. We English cannot bear the thought of defeat. To dissolve an unhappy marriage is to recognise defeat by life, and we would rather that other people lived in wretchedness all their days than admit that members of our race had come up against something too hard to overcome. The English do not care about making the best out of this life in reality so long as they can do it in appearance." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> started breaking up. She never knew what I was talking about, what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E

But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now.

2500|$|John McCain {{would later}} say, [...] "My marriage's {{collapse}} was attributable {{to my own}} selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup of <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E
