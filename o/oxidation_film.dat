The results showed that oxidation rate was affected strongly by induction heating temperature and deformation degree. The thickness distribution of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> was uneven and increased from the larger diameter end to the smaller diameter end along the axial direction of tapered pipe. When induction heating temperature raised or the distance between heat and cold sources was increased, or feed speed was decreased, oxidation rate was accelerated and <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> on the tapered pipe surface thickened significantly, due to massive cracks in <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> induced by deformation of metal matrix.

40|$|Abstract. A {{lead-free}} hypoeutectic solder Sn- 0. 3 Ag- 0. 68 Cu-X {{with low}} sliver content was prepared {{by a new}} process. By the method of skimming surface <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> at static state, the growing behaviors of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> {{on the surface of}} liquid solder alloy were studied. The experimental results show that the growth rate of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> on the surface of liquid solder decreases greatly after surface modification process. Before the surface modification process, the growth behaviors of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> on the surface of liquid solder obey parabolic law which changes with variation of time. After surface modification, the growth behavior of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> of liquid solder is transformed into obeying logarithmic law. The formation rate of oxidation slag on the surface of liquid Sn- 0. 3 Ag- 0. 68 Cu-X solder can be reduced to 0. 36 mg/cm 2. min at 260 ºC under standard test conditions. Conceptually, the atomic-doping X (X=Ga, In, Bi, Ge, Sb, Ni and P) was absorbed to the surface of liquid solder according to Gibbs absorption equation and entered into <b>oxidation</b> <b>film,</b> which is prone to form more compact <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> to prevent the oxidation on the surface of liquid solder...|$|E

The results show that the oxide layer is a kind of porous ceramic intermixture and contains Ca and P. The films in the simulated body fluid can induce apatite formation, resulting in excellent bioactivity.

Surface and cross-sectional morphologies and composition distributions of anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>films</b> were observed and determined by scanning electron microscope equipped with energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM/EDS).

Sn- 37 Pb solder alloys doped Ni, Al and Cr {{separately}} were prepared, and {{the effect}} of trace doped elements on the surface film structure of Sn-Pb liquid solder alloys was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the surface of Sn- 37 Pb liquid alloys was mainly SnO 2 and PbO after oxidizing and laying for five minutes at 250 °C, and the enrichment of trace Al and Cr was on alloy surface, but the enrichment of trace element Ni was not obvious. The surface <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> of Sn-Pb liquid solder alloys was become denser after adding 0. 05 wt % Ni or Al, which will reduce the growth rate of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film.</b> The thickness of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> was only one-fifth of its original under experimental conditions.

40|$|Mechanism of {{residual}} stresses generated in anodic oxidized film on lead alloy substrate was investigated using CrO 3 solution with {{the influence of}} electric field. The stresses formation process, their relationship with surface morphology and structure of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> were discussed in details {{based on the results}} of SEM, XRD and Raman tests. It is indicated that Cr 2 O 7 2 - and HCrO 4 - ions are absorbed on lead alloy surface in the initial formation process of <b>oxidation</b> <b>film.</b> Then PbCrO 4 is formed on the interface of Cr 2 O 7 2 - and Pb. HCrO 4 - oxidizes Pb into PbO under electric field. At the same time, the stresses are generated gradually in the oxide film and increase quickly with current density increase. However, enhanced oxygen evolution promotes the formation of PbO or β-PbO 2 with the increase oxidation time. Meanwhile, the growth of crystalline grain for lead oxides is believed to be mismatched with the developing inner stresses, releasing inner stresses, which lead to residual stresses decreasing in <b>oxidation</b> <b>film.</b> The film is cracked because stresses gradient increases remarkably in oxidized film due to the crystal lattice difference in different lead oxides...|$|E

30|$|The {{anodization}} method {{is one of}} the effective ways to synthesize ordered alignment and aspect radio TiO 2 nanotubes as shown in Fig.  1 c [35]. The anodic Ti foil dissolve (metal corrosion or electropolishing) to Ti metal cation under the action of electrolyte and electric field. On the one hand, the produced Ti metal cation reacts with the O 2 − (produced by water electrolysis) and forms a TiO 2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> on the surface of Ti foil, resulting in the increase of resistance. Therefore, the formation rate of TiO 2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> decreases. On the other side, the produced TiO 2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>film</b> is dissolved by the electrolyte. Under the combined action of formation and dissolution, nanotube arrays synthesize on the surface of Ti foil. The nanotube morphology depends on many influence factors: applied voltage, electrolyte composition, and pH value. In 2000, Grimes et al. presented that an aligned and organized TiO 2 with an average tube diameter from 25 to 65  nm nanotubes fabricated by {{anodization method}} [36]. In addition, Grimes reviewed the fabrication, properties of highly ordered TiO 2 nanotube arrays made by anodic oxidation of titanium in fluoride-based electrolytes [37].

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig.  2, {{it can be}} concluded that FRP and ND steel are the two materials that went through most dramatic weight loss after immersed in the acid condensation. Polyurea and VEGF also underwent minor weight loss, while there was almost no change for titanium alloy and foam glass blocks under the same experimental conditions. These results are in consistent with those under the cyclic wet-dry environments. As for VEGF, the corrosion rate was as high as around 2.02  mm/y; whereas for ND steel, FRP and polyurea, it was respectively 1.21, 1.19 and 1.12  mm/y, indicating the cyclic wet-dry environments placed a great damage to these four materials. Least loss occurred to titanium alloy and foam glass blocks. Titanium alloy was always stable in both corrosion environments mainly because of the formed adherent and protective surface <b>oxidation</b> <b>films</b> when implanted with different elements. Foam glass blocks embraced excellent corrosion resistance due to the formation and protection of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 layers.|$|R

The film is composed of forsterite phase Mg 2 SiO 4 and magnesia MgO. The elemental depth profile shows that Mg, Si and O have a gradient distribution within the film. The gradient distribution of Mg, Si, O also indicated that the relative content of Mg 2 SiO 4 decreased, while MgO increases in the depth direction to the alloy substrate.
