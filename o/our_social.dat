25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality {{is not something that}} we can discover because it does not pre-exist prior to <b>our</b> <b>social</b> invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E

25|$|If the {{quotation}} is organically interwoven into one’s own text, the quoted part is marked with quotation marks, and common words beginning {{the quotation}} {{are written in}} lowercase (even despite the original). For example: A tanterv szerint az iskola egyik célja, hogy „testileg, szellemileg egészséges nemzedéket neveljen”. ‘According to the syllabus, {{one of the goals}} of a school is “to bring up a generation healthy in body and mind.”’ When quoting others’ words in terms of their content, the quotation marks are not used: Alkotmányunk kimondja, hogy társadalmi rendszerünknek a munka az alapja. ‘Our constitution states that <b>our</b> <b>social</b> system is based on work.’ Indirect (reported) speech is treated in the same way.|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in <b>our</b> <b>social</b> and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Implicit {{memory is}} the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's effect on <b>our</b> <b>social</b> interactions has been {{illustrated by the}} pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E

25|$|This {{thesis of}} {{negative}} capability {{is a key}} component in Unger's theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims that <b>our</b> <b>social</b> worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, {{and there is no}} necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.|$|E
25|$|Fitzpatrick {{continues}} to develop her {{ideas of the}} importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and <b>our</b> <b>social</b> practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as {{part of the process of}} their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.|$|E
500|$|Glazunov {{adds that}} his {{relationship}} with Tchaikovsky changed from the elder composer being [...] "not ... one of our own" [...] to a close friendship that would last until Tchaikovsky's death. [...] "I met Tchaikovsky quite often both at Balakirev's and at my own home", Glazunov remembered. [...] "We usually met over music. He always appeared in <b>our</b> <b>social</b> circle {{as one of the}} most welcome guests; besides myself and Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev were also constant members of our circle." [...] This circle, with which Tchaikovsky would spend an increasing amount of time in the last couple of years of his life, would come to be known as the Belyayev circle, named after its patron, Belyayev. According to musicologist Richard Taruskin, Belyayev, through his financial influence, would shape Russian music more greatly and lastingly than either Balakirev or Stasov were able to do.|$|E

40|$|Interpersonal {{touch is}} <b>our</b> most {{primitive}} <b>social</b> language strongly governing our emotional well-being. Despite the positive implications of touch in many facets of <b>our</b> daily <b>social</b> interactions, we find wide-spread caution and taboo limiting touch-based interactions in workplace relationships that constitute {{a significant part}} of <b>our</b> daily <b>social</b> life. In this paper, we explore new opportunities for ubicomp technology to promote a new meme of casual and cheerful interpersonal touch such as high-fives towards facilitating vibrant workplace culture. Specifically, we propose High 5, a mobile service with a smartwatch-style system to promote high-fives in everyday workplace interactions. We first present initial user motivation from semi-structured interviews regarding the potentially controversial idea of High 5. We then present our smartwatch-style prototype to detect high-fives based on sensing electric skin potential levels. We demonstrate its key technical observation and performance evaluation.

500|$|The book's {{scholarship}} {{was very}} well received by critics. The research behind the book was called impressive for its breadth, and its presentation {{was said to be}} straightforward and thought-provoking. Critics called Homer-Dixon's writing clear, accessible, and engaging. In his review in the Quill & Quire, Mark Shainblum wrote [...] "espite the book's serious import and prodigious endnotes, The Ingenuity Gap is a surprisingly engaging and even exciting read. Homer-Dixon spins parables masterfully, using comprehensible examples to represent the almost incomprehensible complexity of <b>our</b> <b>social</b> system." [...] The Library Journal highly recommended it for academic and general public libraries. Several critics were disappointed by the lack of recommendations to address the problems he raises. The reviewers for Books in Canada, The Canadian Geographer, and the National Post found Homer-Dixon's writing self-indulgent because it overly details his travels and experiences, and because of his overly authoritative tone that compliments people that agree with him and shows little consideration of differing perspectives.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{also argued}} that our primary {{categories}} for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, {{that gave rise to}} most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of <b>our</b> <b>social</b> gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, [...] "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.|$|E
500|$|Goldman, in her {{political}} youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. Goldman {{at the time}} believed {{that the use of}} violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated propaganda of the deed—attentat, or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner Alexander Berkman's attempt to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick, and even begged him to allow her to participate. She believed that Frick's actions during the Homestead strike were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. [...] "Yes," [...] she wrote later in her autobiography, [...] "the end in this case justified the means." [...] While she never gave explicit approval of Leon Czolgosz's assassination of US President William McKinley, she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in [...] "The Psychology of Political Violence": [...] "the accumulated forces in <b>our</b> <b>social</b> and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C+. Handlen criticized the episode's lack of resolution, noting that [...] "The show can feed <b>our</b> <b>social</b> {{paranoia}} [...] {{but when it}} comes time to deliver on all this, to finally pull back the curtain and move on to the next stage, it fumbles things." [...] Furthermore, he called the Mulder/Scully/Fowley love triangle [...] "immediately off-putting" [...] and criticized Mimi Rogers's characterization. However, Handlen did call The Smoking Man's return [...] "thrilling" [...] and wrote that the burning of Mulder's office was [...] "arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized the closing down of the X-Files division, due largely to the fact that [...] "we've seen [...] before", a reference to the divisions's closing at the conclusion of the show's first season. However, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'The End' works in spite of itself", citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as positive points in the episode.|$|E
