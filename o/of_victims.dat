40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to briefly {{introduce}} criminalistic victimology and characterise <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a crime. Text is composed of six chapters, concerning {{different aspects of the}} topic. First two deal with the science of criminalistic victimology. Following two examine role <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> during criminal investigation according to criminalistic victimology. Last two chapters reflect position <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> in contemporary czech criminal law. The first chapter defines basic terminology used in criminalistic victimology, different to terms of criminal law. The second chapter documents origins and evolution of criminalistic victimology and its place among related disciplines. The third chapter is focused on the object of criminalistic victimology, i. e. victim's role in criminal investigation. It is further divided in nine parts examining relation <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> and offender, victim's role in genesis <b>of</b> criminal situation, <b>victim</b> as originator and carrier of forensic evidence, significance <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> for criminal investigation, victim as crime reporter and witness with focus on question of credibility, participation <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> during other investigative measures and finally expert examination <b>of</b> <b>victim.</b> The fourth chapter concentrates on the issue of secondary harm caused by inappropriate behaviour towards victim during [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) medical {{examiners}} identified {{most of the}} bodies within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only one body was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the examiners used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian {{medical examiners}} using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification <b>of</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{large group}} <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its death sentences.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has {{established that the}} perception <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> treatment is influenced {{by a number of}} factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, economic status of the people, prior victimization and so on.

Data were collected using a structured questionnaire from a sample of 725 students from the city of Chennai (India) and 715 students from the city of Mito in Japan. The results revealed that while some of the factors such as gender, age, religion and community of the respondents have significantly influenced the perception <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> treatment, the effects of place of stay, nativity and income on the perception <b>of</b> <b>victim</b> treatment were not found to be significant...|$|R

In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. Rescue workers also searched for bodies <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys <b>of</b> <b>victims</b> resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E

The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the Canadian search vessels that recovered the victims' bodies. Various other museums, including the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and the SeaCity Museum in Southampton, have objects donated by survivors and relatives <b>of</b> <b>victims,</b> including some items that were retrieved from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>victims.</b> More donated Titanic artifacts {{are to be found in}} the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and the Titanic Historical Society's museum in Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts.
