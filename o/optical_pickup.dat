50|$|Zon is {{also known}} as the first {{manufacturer}} to offer an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> system from Lightwave Systems as a standard option on its basses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>pickup</b> guitars {{were first}} {{shown at the}} 1969 NAMM in Chicago, by Ron Hoag. In 2000, Christopher Willcox, founder of LightWave Systems, {{unveiled}} a new beta technology for an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> system using infrared light. In May 2001, LightWave Systems released their second generation pickup, dubbed the [...] "S2." [...] The S2 featured LightWave Systems' monolithic bridge, six-channel motherboard, {{and a host of}} other improvements, making the technology more practical for use in both live and recording studio settings.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>pickups</b> {{are another}} type of {{non-magnetic}} pickup. They use an infrared LED to optically track {{the movement of the}} string, similar to the mechanism of modern computer mice, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the [...] "hum" [...] or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic <b>pickups.</b> Since <b>optical</b> <b>pickups</b> do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies. LightWave Systems builds basses with <b>optical</b> <b>pickups.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>pickups</b> are {{a type of}} pickup {{that sense}} string and body {{vibrations}} using infrared LED light. These pickups are not sensitive to EMI.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>pickups</b> are {{a fairly}} recent {{development}} that work by sensing the interruption {{of a light}} beam by a vibrating string. The light source is usually an LED, and the detector is a photodiode or phototransistor. [...] These pickups are completely resistant to magnetic or electric interference and also have a very broad and flat frequency response, unlike magnetic pickups.|$|R
5000|$|The {{possibility}} of using <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> technology, to allow any standard cane-reeded bagpipe {{to be made}} [...] "electric", was raised in August 2016 by Scottish Smallpipes player Donald WG Lindsay. This led to articles in UK & Scottish dailies, including a short video [...] demonstrating a prototype instrument of this type.|$|E
50|$|Because EFM ensures {{there are}} at least two zeroes between every two ones, it is {{guaranteed}} that every pit and land is at least three bit-clock cycles long. This property is very useful since it reduces the demands on the <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> used in the playback mechanism. The ten consecutive-zero maximum ensures worst-case clock recovery in the player.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, LaserDisc videos {{sometimes}} {{exhibit a}} problem known as [...] "crosstalk". The issue can arise when the laser <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> assembly within the player {{is out of}} alignment or because the disc is damaged or excessively warped, {{but it could also}} occur even with a properly functioning player and a factory-new disc, depending on electrical and mechanical alignment problems. In these instances, the issue arose {{due to the fact that}} CLV discs require subtle changes in rotating speed at various points during playback. During a change in speed, the <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> inside the player might read video information from a track adjacent to the intended one, causing data from the two tracks to [...] "cross"; the extra video information picked up from that second track shows up as distortion in the picture which looks reminiscent of swirling [...] "barber poles" [...] or rolling lines of static.|$|E
5000|$|Like the LT1, it {{features}} sequential fuel injection, reverse-flow cooling, and an <b>optical</b> ignition <b>pickup.</b> Output is [...] and 245 lbft Nm. Due to its smaller displacement, it provides better fuel economy than the 5.7 L LT1, but at reduced horsepower & torque levels.|$|R
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{speaking}} clocks, there was ancillary equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks {{to ensure that the}} system was [...] "on time". From a maintenance point of view, {{the most important part of}} the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the <b>optical</b> <b>pickups</b> from the glass disk recordings. When Time & Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton, the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of Caesium Beam Primary standards installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of micro gratings and polarization beam splitters for potential use in micro <b>optical</b> <b>pickups</b> are presented. Silicon nitride {{is used as}} the optical material for its low absorption in the visible wavelength. The micro components are framed by a pop-up poly-silicon mechanism as in the standard surface micromachining technology. The micro grating is a binary phase grating. The diffraction ratio between 4 and 10 can be achieved provided that the duty cycle is between 0. 4 and 0. 6 and the depth between 455 nm and 485 nm. For a grating designed for a diffraction ratio of 7, the measured ratio is 8. 31. The polarizing beam splitter is a silicon nitride thin film placed at the Brewster angle. The transmittance of the TM mode of a micro polarization beam splitter {{was measured to be}} more than 98. 50 %...|$|R
50|$|This {{series of}} {{machines}} {{had a reputation}} for CD drive problems — the original <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> sled (KSM-440AAM) was made of thermoplastic and placed close to the power supply, eventually leading to uneven wear that moved the laser into a position where it was no longer parallel with the CD surface. Late KSM-440ACM drives had the sled replaced with a die-cast one with hard nylon inserts in order to address the issue.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were very}} few {{products}} seen on the market that could write data to these discs. Most notable was the Topy Mini Writer, which retailed for $130 (USD) and housed an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> unit (image №4) with a USB interface board, allowing the use of DataPlay discs much like other end-user writable optical media (e.g., CD-Rs). Other noted products were the iriver IDP-100 and the MTV Video Device [...] "MTV FLIP", which both housed the prototype-based model (image №2).|$|E
5000|$|Assuming the player's <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> is {{in proper}} working order, {{crosstalk}} distortion normally {{does not occur}} during playback of CAV format LaserDiscs, as the rotational speed never varies. However, if the player calibration is out of order or if the CAV disc is faulty or damaged, other problems affecting tracking accuracy can occur. One such problem is [...] "laser lock", where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again, causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused.|$|E
50|$|In an <b>optical</b> bagpipe <b>pickup,</b> {{light is}} passed {{directly}} through the reed while playing, and collected by a receiver, {{in the form}} of a photodiode or phototransistor. The output from the receiver is then fed to an amplifier, which may be built into the instrument or separate from it, and on to a loudspeaker from which the amplified sound can be heard.|$|R
5000|$|The L99 {{featured}} updated Generation II block {{architecture and}} is visually {{identical to the}} larger 5.7 L LT1 Generation II V8. Like the LT1, it features sequential fuel injection, reverse-flow cooling, and an <b>optical</b> ignition <b>pickup.</b> Output is [...] and 245 lbft Nm. Due to its smaller displacement, the L99 provided higher EPA fuel economy ratings than the 5.7 L LT1. The L99 was produced for the 1994-1996 model years.|$|R
40|$|An in-line {{photoresist}} thickness {{measuring device}} wherein {{a plurality of}} projection optical fibers are disposed over a wafer processing track for illuminating portions of a wafer as the wafer proceeds along the track. The light scattered back from each illuminated portion is detected by a corresponding plurality of <b>pickup</b> <b>optical</b> fibers and communicated to an optical fiber multiplexer. The multiplexer sequentially selects the optical signal from each <b>pickup</b> <b>optical</b> fiber and communicates {{the light from the}} selected <b>pickup</b> <b>optical</b> fiber to a spectrometer. The spectrometer simultaneously diffuses the scattered light into a plurality of light bands, each light band having a different wavelength. The plurality of light bands are projected in parallel onto a pin diode array which acts as a photodeteeter. The electrical signals generated by each pin diode in response to the incident light bands are communicated to a processor which calculates resist thickness for each illuminated portion of the wafer. The average and standard deviation values for the thickness data may be calculated as well...|$|R
5000|$|The space-consuming analog {{video signal}} of a LaserDisc limited {{playback}} duration to 30/36 minutes (CAV NTSC/PAL) or 60/64 minutes (CLV NTSC/PAL) per side {{because of the}} hardware manufacturer's refusal to reduce line count for increased playtime. After one side was finished playing, a disc has to be flipped over to continue watching a movie, and some titles fill two or more discs. Many players, especially units built after the mid-1980s, can [...] "flip" [...] discs automatically by rotating the <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> {{to the other side}} of the disc, but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change. If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc, manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film. One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD-W1, which features the ability to load two discs and to play each side of one disc and then to switch to playing each side of the other disc. In addition, perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs, which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side. In later years, Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer, which [...] "grabbed" [...] a single field or frame from a CLV disc.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} design of a high speed atomic force {{microscope}} using an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> from a commercially available compact disc/digital versatile disc drive. An investigation of the commercial <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> is done with the goal of determining how it can be used for dimensional measurements on nanometer scale. An evaluation of noise sources, imaging capabilities, and functionality is performed...|$|E
5000|$|Other ways {{to reduce}} {{feedback}} include: playing with the bass amp's speaker cabinets in front of, rather than behind, the instrument; reducing the onstage volume; moving the bass away from other loud instruments, such as the drum kit (low toms can trigger feedback on some basses) or the rhythm guitar player's amp); signal phase reversing; using a parametric equalizer or [...] "notch filter" [...] EQ {{to turn down the}} frequency that is feeding back; or using [...] "feedback eliminators", which are basically automatic notch filters that find and turn down the frequency that is [...] "howling." [...] Some other {{ways to reduce}} feedback are to use a plywood laminate bass rather than a carved wood bass, use a solid - body electric upright bass and/or use magnetic or <b>optical</b> <b>pickups.</b> Many of the methods used to reduce feedback (notch filters, filling the f-holes with foam) have effects on the tone of the instrument. However, these drawbacks need to be considered against the significant problems for the audience's experience caused by unwanted feedback.|$|R
40|$|Micromachining {{technology}} {{opens up}} many {{new opportunities for}} optical and optoelectronic systems. It offers unprecedented capabilities in extending the functionality of optical devices and the miniaturization of optical systems. Movable structures, microactu-ators, and microoptical elements can be monolithically integrated on the same substrate using batch processing technologies. In this paper, we review the recent advances in this fast-emerging field. The basic bulk- and surface-micromachining technologies appli-cable to optical systems are reviewed.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the reading capability of a novel <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> consisting of a single-mode and a multi-mode rectangular waveguide. According to the simulations, if one has prior information about the structure of the disk, superresolution readout could be achieved.

The different spots can be controlled independently. The <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> consists of different diffractive optical elements (DOEs). The measured full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) spot intensity for the DOE-pickup is 0. 76 mu m-close to the diffraction limited predicted value of 0. 71 mu m-indicating good optical performance. The measured highest diffraction efficiencies of the realized DOEs are about 92 %...|$|E

By using the new microoptical system techniques, we fabricated a miniaturized <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> head module.

40|$|Technological {{obstacles}} {{to the use}} of rotary-type swing arm actuators to actuate <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> modules in small-form-factor (SFF) disk drives stem from a hinge’s skewed actuation, subsequently inducing off-axis aberrations and deteriorating optical quality. This work describes a dual-stage seesaw-swivel actuator for <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> actuation. A triple-layered bimorph bender made of piezoelectric materials (PZTs) is connected to the suspension of the pickup head, while the tunable vibration absorber (TVA) unit is mounted on the seesaw swing arm to offer a balanced force to reduce vibrations in a focusing direction. Both PZT and TVA are designed to satisfy stable focusing operation operational requirements and compensate for the tilt angle or deformation of a disc. Finally, simulation results verify the performance of the dual-stage seesaw-swivel actuator, along with experimental procedures and parametric design optimization confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{measuring system}} of laser feedback noise for an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> was specifically implemented only for laser diodes {{by using a}} static optical system. With no closed-loop servo control, {{it is impossible to}} measure the genuine laser noise distribution of a pickup while operating in an optical drive. By modifying the optical system of a commercial pickup, this study built up a system that was integrated with precision mechanical design, optical design, servo control design, and opto-electronic signal inspection for providing dynamic real-time laser feedback noise measurement. Using this system, some experimental results have been observed. The laser feedback noise is responsible to the focusing point within the linear range of an <b>optical</b> <b>pickup</b> head. It has the maximum value while the lens is on the best focus. The higher the environmental temperature, the noisier the laser output will be. Besides, the central frequency of noise is dependent on the disk rotation speed, and the noise level is reducible by increasing the disk rotation speed.
