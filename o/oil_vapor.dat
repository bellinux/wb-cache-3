40|$|Linseed oil is very {{important}} in industry but its use is limited due to noxious vapors produced by oxidation on exposure to air. Since some of the products are toxic, release of linseed <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> to the environment is normally prohibited. In order to remove the odorous compounds, a biofilter system based on bacterial metabolism was designed and the major premises of bioremediation were studied. A total of five bacterial strains capable of using linseed <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> as their sources of carbon and energy were isolated from soil. The individual organisms were also mixed to form a bacterial consortium. The mixed population was able to degrade linseed <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> with more than 99 per cent efficiency. According to this research, a successful biodegradation system was designed and, theoretically, this system could be applied to the removal of linseed <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> in any industrial plant air stream...|$|R
50|$|In this process, crushed {{oil shale}} is {{fed into the}} top of the retort where it is mixed with the hot oil shale ash. The oil shale moves {{downward}} through the retort as fluidized bed of particles. While descending, the heat is transferred from the oil shale ash to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale <b>oil</b> <b>vapors,</b> <b>oil</b> shale gas and spent oil shale. A stripping gas is inserted from the bottom of retort, which carries <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> into solids separation section. The fine particles are directed to the combustor while <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> are moved to the condenser. In condenser, shale oil is separated from water vapor and product gases. On the bottom of retort the spent shale is transported to cumbustor.|$|R

50|$|Another {{issue that}} has been raised as a {{possible}} problem with allowing <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> into the intake is the chance of pre-detonation (Knock) caused by the <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> exploding during the compression cycle of the engine. This has become more of an issue {{as more and more}} cars have started to run high boost levels and high compression ratios. The higher the compression and boost the more likely the oil is to start to burn (Pre-Detonate)Fitting an oil catch tank (can) in the breather pipe will stop the oil vapors from reaching the combustion chamber. This will reduce the knock effect.|$|E

50|$|The Union retort {{design has}} several advantages. The {{reducing}} {{atmosphere in the}} retort allows the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds through the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. <b>Oil</b> <b>vapors</b> are cooled by the raw oil, thus minimizing polymer formation among the hydrocarbon fractions.|$|R
50|$|The {{power source}} was {{converted}} to mineral oil in 1882, and to incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> in 1913. The light was automated in 1949. In 1994 the Coast Guard removed {{the light from}} the lantern room and decommissioned the lighthouse.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} has {{had four}} different light sources during its history. First, {{it had an}} oil wick lamp, and then an <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamp. Three different fuels were used: whale oil, lard oil, and kerosene. Later, two different kinds of electric lights were used.|$|E
50|$|On March 3, 1875, $20,000 was {{appropriated}} for {{the construction}} of the light, which began in 1889. The light's construction upon a caisson in Cold Spring Harbor was finished in 1890, and it was first lit on January 31 of that year. The light was refitted with an <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamp in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Filters with {{activated}} carbon are usually used in compressed air and gas purification to remove <b>oil</b> <b>vapors,</b> odor, and other hydrocarbons from the air.

50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{of this technology}} {{is the fact that}} produced shale <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> are mixed with shale ash causing impurities in shale oil. Ensuring the quality of produced shale oil is complicated as compared with other mineral dusts the shale ash is more difficult to collect.|$|R
2500|$|Above {{the smoke}} point are flash and fire points.

The flash point generally occurs at about [...] The fire point is the temperature at which hot <b>oil</b> produces sufficient <b>vapors</b> they will catch on fire and burn. As frying hours increase, all these temperature points decrease. They depend more on an oil's acidity than fatty-acid profile.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} lamp burned kerosene; in 1909 it {{was replaced}} with an incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamp. In 1924 a generator was installed to provide electricity in the keepers' dwellings and to pump water, replacing an old windmill pump. The lighthouse beacon was electrified in 1933 with a 500-watt lamp. The first order Fresnel lens {{was replaced with}} a third order rotating Fresnel lens at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 a Fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. The early {{coal fired}} system used {{approximately}} seven tons of coal {{to run around}} 1000 hours and when converted to oil ran 423 hours on 195 gallons of oil. The original 24,000 candlepower, provided by an incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamp, was increased to 30,000 candlepower powered by an electric lamp and the fourth-order lens, and by 1971 to 500,000 candlepower.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{years later}} the {{lighthouse}} was equipped with a radio beacon, the first in Hawaii. As this required a generating station, the lamp was changed from <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> to a 500W incandescent bulb. The light was automated in 1974, the radiobeacon having been discontinued the previous year. Shortly thereafter the lighthouse keeper's quarters were used to house witnesses in the federal tax evasion case of Wilford [...] "Nappy" [...] Pulawa.|$|E
50|$|The San Juan National Historic Site {{was also}} {{affected}} after the spill. Due to its {{close proximity to}} the water, intense <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> were present inside of the fort located at the site for up to three weeks following the spill. National Park Service workers reported that the fumes were strong enough to induce headaches.|$|R
5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> cannot burn.|$|R
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. <b>Oil</b> <b>vapors</b> can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of seventy-three, Kate Walker {{retired as}} the Robbins Reef keeper. In her thirty-three years at the lighthouse, Kate saw the {{progression}} from kerosene lamps to <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamps and eventually to electricity. Minding the light became much easier as time moved into the 20th century. After her retirement, Kate lived in a small cottage with a garden on Staten Island where she was frequently spotted observing Robbins Reef.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} of the Batag lighthouse was of Barbier, Benard & Turenne (Paris) manufacture, with incandescent lighting system of 3,000 candlepower. [...] The third-order dioptric prismatic lenses revolving on mercury floats, {{which by the}} refraction and reflection of rays from the incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> lamps produce white flashes of approximately 100,000 candlepower which are clearly visible under ordinary conditions at the limit of their geographical ranges of 25 nautical miles (40.2 km).|$|E
50|$|In September 1912, an {{incandescent}} <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> {{system was}} {{installed at the}} light tower. This new system was able to decrease the amount of cleaning needed while increasing the temperature and burn intensity. Kerosene was forced into a heated chamber where it was vaporized. It was then sent into the mantle where it would burn very brightly. (This highly effective and very efficient type of system is similar to what is used in smaller Coleman lanterns carried by campers today.|$|E

500|$|The {{oldest and}} the most common {{extraction}} method involves pyrolysis (also known as retorting or destructive distillation). [...] In this process, oil shale is heated {{in the absence of}} oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> and non-condensable combustible oil shale gas. [...] <b>Oil</b> <b>vapors</b> and <b>oil</b> shale gas are then collected and cooled, causing the shale oil to condense. [...] In addition, oil shale processing produces spent oil shale, which is a solid residue. Spent shale consists of inorganic compounds (minerals) and chara carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent shale produces oil shale ash. Spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture. [...] The composition of the oil shale may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including ammonia, sulfur, aromatic compounds, pitch, asphalt, and waxes.|$|R
5000|$|As {{reported}} by NYU's ScienceLine, ExxonMobil's testing {{indicates that the}} existence of <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> remains unclear: [...] "This summer, a contractor for Exxon Mobil conducted a soil vapor study in Greenpoint.

50|$|The {{original}} beacon was a second-order range lens {{showing a}} fixed red light that shined 192 ft above sea level. In 1891 {{the light was}} changed to fixed white. In 1907 the light source was changed from oil to incandescent <b>oil</b> <b>vapor,</b> which magnified {{the intensity of the}} light. In 1939 a sixth-order range lens was installed, showing a fixed white light. John B. Fountain was the first light keeper, who resided in the light keepers house upon which the lighthouse tower was built.|$|E
50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive Crankcase Ventilation system, introduced <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|E
50|$|In 1885 {{he started}} the Imperial Oil Company in Petrolia, Ontario. The oil from Petrolia {{contained}} up to 0.7% sulfur, which gave the petroleum made from it a strong odor and the name skunk oil, making it practically unmarketable. After several tries, {{he was able to}} desulfurize the petroleum by reacting the <b>oil</b> <b>vapor</b> with a mixture of iron, lead, and copper oxides. The sulfides thus formed were then roasted in air to remove the sulfur and reform the oxides which could then be reused. His product became a serious competitor to Pennsylvania oil.|$|E
50|$|As a heat carrier, LLNL HRS process uses spent {{oil shale}}. Raw oil shale and spent oil shale are mixed in the {{fluidized}} bed mixer. The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale <b>oil</b> <b>vapors,</b> <b>oil</b> shale gas and spent <b>oil</b> shale. <b>Oil</b> <b>vapors</b> are collected from the pyrolyzer. The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon (char), by the air pneumatic lift pipe to the delayed-fall combustor where it is combusted to heat the process. The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil shale ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|R
50|$|The {{main issue}} {{is with the}} buildup of oil inside the intake piping and manifold. During the normal {{operation}} of an engine the excess blow-by and <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> from the crank case are allowed to enter the intake system. The oil mist cools and layers {{the inside of the}} intake piping and manifold. Over time this layer can build up and thick sludge can accumulate.|$|R
50|$|This {{has been}} made worse with the {{introduction}} of the Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on more modern cars. The <b>oil</b> <b>vapors</b> can mix with the re-circulated exhaust gasses and soot which then builds up on the intake manifold and valves etc. This layer over time hardens and thickens repeatedly. It will then begin to clog up the throttle body, swirl flaps, or even the intake valves on direct injected engines.|$|R
