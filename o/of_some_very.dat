2500|$|After all this, {{the version}} of the [...] "set of all sets" [...] paradox {{conceived}} by Bertrand Russell in 1903 led to a serious crisis in set theory. Russell recognized that the statement x = x is true for every set, and thus the set of all sets is defined by [...] {x | x = x}. In 1906 he constructed several paradox sets, {{the most famous of}} which is the set of all sets which do not contain themselves. Russell himself explained this abstract idea by means <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> concrete pictures. One example, known as the Barber paradox, states: The male barber who shaves all and only men who don't shave themselves has to shave himself only if he does not shave himself.|$|E

Rakoff's first major film role was in A cloud in trousers, a short film by Gregg Bordowitz (1995) which appeared on public television, with Rakoff playing Vladimir Mayakovsky on whose poetry the film was based. His subsequent film appearances include performances as a librarian in Cheryl Dunyé's film The Watermelon Woman (1996), an appearance by {{the back of his}} head as Ben Baron, who is dismissive to Harper Lee, in Bennett Miller's Capote (2005), a non-speaking role as Boswell in Paul Dinello's Strangers with Candy (2005) (which was co-written by Amy Sedaris), and roles as a publishing boss in Bad Bosses Go to Hell (1997) and as a duplicitous director in Alison MacLean's film Intolerable.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, the duo {{began working}} on , a satire of big-budget action films and their {{associated}} clichés and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications {{of the politics of}} the United States. Starring puppets, Team America was produced using a crew of about 200 people, which sometimes required four people at a time to manipulate a marionette. Although the filmmakers hired three dozen highly skilled marionette operators, execution <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> simple acts by the marionettes proved to be very difficult, with a simple shot such as a character drinking taking a half-day to complete successfully. The deadline for the film's completion took a toll on both filmmakers, as did various difficulties in working with puppets, with Stone, who described the film as [...] "the worst time of [...] life", resorting to coffee to work 20-hour days and sleeping pills to go to bed. The film was barely completed in time for its October release date, but reviews were positive and the film made a modest sum at the box office.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bungle {{played their}} first show during November 1985 at the Bayside Grange Hall. The band's first demo, The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny, was {{recorded}} during Easter of 1986. It featured a fast, low-fi death/thrash sound, with touches of ska. Instruments utilized {{on the album}} included a train whistle, saxophone, bongos and a kazoo. The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny was followed in 1987 by the Bowel of Chiley demo; it featured a much greater ska presence, {{as well as the}} sounds of jazz, swing and funk. Bradley Torreano noted at AllMusic that the recording was [...] "essentially the sound <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> talented teenagers trying to make their love of jazz and ska come together in whatever way they can." [...] In 1988, Mr. Bungle released their third demo, Goddammit I Love America!, which was musically similar to Bowel of Chiley. Mike Patton described its style as [...] "funkadelic, thrashing, circus, ska."

2500|$|Charles Archibald Wiles - A useful middle-order batsman whose {{first-class}} career {{spanned the}} years 1920 to 1936, Archie Wiles remains the second oldest Test debutant for West Indies. [...] He was 40 years and 345 days {{old when he}} appeared in the second Test of 1933 against England and is surpassed in age only by N. Betancourt who was 42 years, 242 days old on his own representative debut three years earlier. [...] Wiles was born in Brigetown, Barbados on August 11, 1892, and died in Diego Martin, Trinidad on November 4, 1957, aged 65. [...] In spite <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good performances with the bat, he failed when the big occasion came at Old Trafford, scoring just 0 and 2. [...] Although born in Barbados, Wiles played his domestic cricket for Trinidad in the Caribbean’s annual Inter-Colonial tournament. [...] During his career, he surpassed fifty runs in an innings on eight occasions, twice going on to make a century; in February 1925 he scored 110 against British Guiana at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad {{and two years later}} he made his highest first-class score, 192, against Barbados at Bridgetown. [...] This particular game, a timeless match played over eight days, was remarkable insofar as despite Wiles’ first innings total, which included a fourth-wicket partnership of 146 with Joe Small, and in spite of Trinidad’s first innings lead of 384, Barbados won by 146 runs (Barbados 175 & 726, Trinidad 559 & 217). [...] Wiles’ death in 1957 went unrecorded at the time and therefore no obituary was written for him for the Wisden Almanack.|$|E
