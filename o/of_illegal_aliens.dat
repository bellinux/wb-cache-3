500|$|Since {{an act of}} Congress {{challenging}} the accepted interpretation of the Citizenship Clause might very possibly be ruled unconstitutional by courts choosing to rely on Wong Kim Ark as a precedent, proposals have also been made to amend the Constitution so as to override the Fourteenth Amendment's language and deny citizenship to U.S.-born children <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> or foreign visitors. For example, Senator Vitter of Louisiana introduced Senate Joint Resolution (S.J.Res.) 6 in the 111th Congress, but like H.R. 1868, it failed to reach the floor of either house of Congress before the 111th Congress adjourned on December 22, 2010.

500|$|Some legal scholars, {{opposed to}} the idea that jus soli should apply to the {{children}} <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens,</b> have argued that the Wong Kim Ark precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally. [...] John C. Eastman, a former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark does not entitle U.S.-born children <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>aliens</b> to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of [...] "full and complete jurisdiction" [...] that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally. [...] Eastman further argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924—which followed Wong Kim Ark—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed [...] "that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth." [...] A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and Rogers M. Smith, political science professor at Yale. According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, even if Wong Kim Ark settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely [...] "children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation". [...] Richard Posner, a judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, has also criticized the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. [...] Charles Wood, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.|$|E

500|$|Writer John Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode after noticing the long lines of migrant workers he would often see at his job when working as a computer programmer in the Los Angeles area.

In the finalized script, it was changed to Eladio once the storylines were combined. Executive producer and series creator Chris Carter was attracted to the soap opera-like aspects of the episode, and {{the title of the}} episode means [...] "The World Turns" [...] in Spanish, a reference to the popular American television soap opera As the World Turns. The Chupacabra is a Latin American folk myth that Shiban originally heard about in an article in The Los Angeles Times about a year prior.
