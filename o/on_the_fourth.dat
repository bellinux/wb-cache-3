5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> day so he could attack the English openers {{for a short period}} before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E

5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> day, but {{the final}} day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|England resumed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> {{morning and}} Johnston quickly removed {{the last three}} wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs.
