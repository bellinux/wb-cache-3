5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand the thought <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|When backup {{arrives on}} the scene, an injured Wetzel {{claims that he}} {{encountered}} gang members. The police soon discover and surround Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), believing them to be criminals, before they realize that the pair are FBI agents. Mulder and Scully claim that they are investigating an alleged werewolf that killed {{a man in the}} area during the last full moon. According to Mulder, the entity that they are tracking only comes out at night. Scully is irritated by the constant presence of the Cops crew, but Mulder is enthused at the prospect of paranormal proof being presented to a national television audience. The agents and the police interview Mrs. Guerrero, who describes the monster to Ricky (Solomon Eversol), a sketch artist. To Mulder's surprise, Mrs. Guerrero describes not a werewolf, but the horror movie villain Freddy Krueger. Ricky expresses a fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> in the dangerous neighborhood, and is found a short time later with serious slashes in his chest. Mulder and Scully find a pink fingernail at the scene. The group also meets Steve and Edy (J. W. Smith and Curtis C.), a couple who witnessed the incident but did not see Ricky's attacker, saying that it appeared he was being attacked by nothing. Scully shows the couple the fingernail, which they identify as belonging to Chantara Gomez (Maria Celedonio), a prostitute.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{character}} in the play are in poverty and all affected by Hester's past. Five of {{the character}}s give insight, called confessions, of what was their previous sexual experience with Hester, and Hester presents her own thoughts near the end. The Doctor's confession is how Hester gave herself {{to help him out}} of despair <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone.</b> The Welfare lady's confession is her first threesome experience thanks to Hester's assistance. Amiga Gringa's confession is what sexual experience Hester and she had to make money together. Reverend D's confession is how Hester's predicament turned him toward God. Finally, Hester's confession is about men's quick love and that she should have thousands of bad children.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} {{subjects}} recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention {{than those who were}} not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> or sleeping.|$|E

25|$|The protagonist, Yoshiyuki Sakurai, {{was born}} when Sakura Yoshino, weary <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> for so long, wished upon a {{prototype}} artificial wish-granting magical sakura tree for a family. Years later, though, the tree starts malfunctioning, granting all wishes, {{regardless of how}} impure. Sakura and Otome Asakura at first try to handle all the problems caused by it, but the situation gradually worsens {{and they have to}} choose whether or not to save —the island in Japan where the story takes place—by deactivating the tree which would erase Yoshiyuki's existence in the process. Sakura makes a last-ditch effort to stop the tree by entering it directly, but fails. Yoshiyuki eventually manages to persuade Otome to choose the island over him, and she has the tree wither, revoking all the granted wishes, including Sakura's.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric and {{emotional}} consequences can be apparent immediately after rape {{and it may}} be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment. Other treatable emotional and psychiatric disorders may not become evident after the rape. These can be eating disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive thoughts, fear of crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal, sexual disorders,(including fear of engaging in sexual activity), mood disorders, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, nightmares, fear of situations that remind the patient of the rape and fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone,</b> agitation, numbness {{and emotional}} distance. Victims are able to receive help by using a telephone hotline, counseling, or shelters. Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept, but support groups, usually accessed by organizations are available to help in recovery. Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was legally}} {{accepted}} as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly {{and as a result}} they despised François because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. François was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until François's grandmother's death before his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. François had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> during Christmas. Being left alone forced François into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.|$|E

500|$|Millett {{wrote her}} autobiographical books Flying (1974) and Sita (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an {{important}} consciousness-raising activity. She realized beginning an open dialogue {{is important to}} break down the isolation and alienation that hiding in privacy can cause. She wrote in Flying what Alice Henry calls in her off our backs review of Sita an [...] "excruciating public and political 'coming out'" [...] and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives. While she discussed some of her love affairs in Flying, in Sita she provides insight into a lesbian love affair and her fears <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> or inadequate. Henry writes, [...] "Kate's transparent vulnerability and attempts to get to the root of herself and grasp her lover are typical of many women who love women." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing it as a [...] "pop fluff" [...] song, Simon Price of The Independent {{wrote that}} [...] "there's always a {{suggestion}} of something interesting going on behind those glitter-encrusted eyes". NME Ben Patashnik applauded the song's suggestive nature; [...] "'So Happy I Could Die' perfectly evokes the feeling <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> in a crowded room with its icy beats, suggesting Gaga takes refuge in masturbation {{as the only way}} to retain control." [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was declared as the twenty-seventh best Lady Gaga song by Rolling Stone, who concluded: [...] "Gaga exults in the pleasures of club-hopping, drinking and bi-curiosity." [...] Under the Radar columnist Nick Hyman avouched that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was an uninspiring track, while Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that Gaga's vocals were the worst out of any of her songs. [...] "It's a bit of a disappointment, too, because for someone who is so painfully deliberate in crafting their unique visual image, it’s a let down to see that some of that quality control couldn’t be applied to the song selection that will ultimately define their legacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other collaborations with Rossellini include L'Amore, a two part {{film from}} 1948 which {{includes}} [...] "The Miracle" [...] and [...] "The Human Voice" [...] ("Il miracolo", and [...] "Una voce umana"). In the former, Magnani, playing a peasant outcast who believes the baby she's carrying is Christ, plumbs both the sorrow and the righteousness <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> in the world. The latter film, based on Jean Cocteau's play {{about a woman}} desperately trying to salvage a relationship over the telephone, is remarkable for {{the ways in which}} Magnani's powerful moments of silence segue into cries of despair.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's {{a lot of}} {{talk about}} negotiating distance from people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning what it means to be alone, learning what it means to be close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone,</b> and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Meditation {{has been}} of {{interest}} {{to a wide variety}} of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called [...] "hitbodedut" [...] (התבודדות, alternatively transliterated as [...] "hisbodedus"), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav. The word derives from the Hebrew word [...] "boded" [...] (בודד), meaning the state <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone.</b> Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of [...] "hisbonenus", related to the Sephirah of [...] "Binah", Hebrew for understanding. This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, an essay from Shakespeare critic Garret A. Sullivan Jr. {{describes}} {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man which is seen in sonnet four, saying [...] "The young man of the procreation sonnets, then, is the object of admonition; the poet (speaker) urgently seeks to make him change his ways, and, as we shall see does so in the intertwined names of beauty and memory and in the face of oblivion". Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self if he decides to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E
60|$|The simple {{circumstance}} <b>of</b> <b>being</b> left <b>alone</b> {{with her}} husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her.|$|R
60|$|Her {{first impulse}} was to follow. With the rifle she might be of {{assistance}} to him, and, further, she could not bear the terrible thought <b>of</b> <b>being</b> left <b>alone</b> {{at the mercy of}} the fearful jungle without a single friend to aid her.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to it than that. However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>alone</b> and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
