40|$|The {{formation}} {{and distribution of}} dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) during cooking was investigated. Concentrations of dl-PCBs in liquid residues, cooked beef, and <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> generated during heating were determined by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS. Although the levels of dl-PCBs in well-done beef were lower {{compared with those of}} raw beef, relatively high concentrations of dl-PCBs were detected in the <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> produced during heating. This suggests that dl-PCBs in raw beef may have volatilized into the <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> during the cooking process. Sucralose and chloropropanols contained in raw materials may have resulted in increased dl-PCB concentrations and the level of toxic equivalents (TEQ) in the <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> produced under high temperature during cooking. Concentrations of dl-PCBs did not vary greatly in cooked beef, except when higher levels of chloropropanols were presented in the uncooked raw materials. Results indicate that sucralose and chloropropanols may promote the formation of dl-PCBs during the cooking process. The newly produced dl-PCBs from raw beef cooking were mainly present in <b>oil</b> <b>fumes,</b> which gave rise to high levels of TEQ in <b>oil</b> <b>fumes.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A case–control study including 268 diagnosed nonsmoking female lung cancer patients and 266 nonsmoking female controls was carried out. Three miRNA polymorphisms (miR- 26 a- 1 rs 7372209, miR- 605 rs 2043556, and miR- 16 - 1 rs 1022960) were analyzed. Both additive and multiplicative interactions were assessed. Results: MiR- 16 - 1 rs 1022960 may be associated with the risk of lung cancer. Carriers with TT genotype of miR- 16 - 1 rs 1022960 were observed to have a decreased risk of lung cancer compared with CC and CT genotype carriers (odds ratio = 0. 550, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 308 – 0. 983, P= 0. 044). MiR- 26 a- 1 rs 7372209 and miR- 605 rs 2043556 showed no statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk. There were no significant associations between the three single nucleotide polymorphisms and lung adenocarcinoma.

The stratified analysis suggested that increased risk associated with ATM rs 189037 AA genotype in individuals who never or seldom were exposed to cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> (adjusted OR 1. 89, 95 %CI 1. 03 - 3. 49, P =  0. 040). CONCLUSIONS: ATM rs 189037 might be associated with the risk of lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese non-smoking females. Furthermore, ATM rs 189037 AA genotype might be a risk factor of lung adenocarcinoma among female non-smokers without cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fume</b> exposure...|$|R
40|$|Four {{groups of}} 30 – 32 male and 30 – 32 female Balb/c mice (weighing 15 ± 3 g) [age unspecified] {{were exposed to}} air heated at 22 – 30 °C (control) or ~ 9, 21 and 39 mg/m 3 cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> for 30 min per day for 2 months, then every other day {{for a period of}} 6 months (150 times overall) after which time they were killed. <b>Oil</b> <b>fumes</b> were {{generated}} by heating an unspecified volume of unrefined rapeseed oil at a temperature of 270 ± 5 °C in a steel container with an electric heating element. Fumes were directed into a cylindrical 1 -m 3 exposure chamber. The incidence of lung tumours in both sexes combined was 0. 0 (0 / 61), 15. 09 (8 / 53; p< 0. 05), 20. 00 (10 / 50; p< 0. 05) and 22. 00 % (11 / 50; p< 0. 05) for the control, low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively.

40|$|MicroRNA {{biosynthesis}} genes {{can affect}} the regulatory effect of global microRNAs to target mRNA and hence influence the genesis and development of human cancer. Here, we selected five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs 7813, rs 2740349, rs 2291778, rs 910924, rs 595961) in two key microRNA biosynthesis genes (GEMIN 4 and AGO 1) and systematically evaluated the association between these SNPs, the gene-environment interaction and lung cancer risk. To control the impact of cigarette smoking on lung cancer, we recruited Chinese female non-smokers for the study. The total number of lung cancer cases and cancer-free controls were 473 and 395 in the case-control study. Four SNPs showed statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk. After Bonferroni correction, rs 7813 and rs 595961 were evidently still associated with lung cancer risk. In the stratified analysis, our results revealed that all five SNPs {{were associated with the}} risk of lung adenocarcinoma; after Bonferroni correction, significant association was maintained for rs 7813, rs 910924 and rs 595961. Haplotype analysis showed GEMIN 4 haplotype C-A-G-T was a protective haplotype for lung cancer. In the combined unfavorable genotype analysis, with the increasing number of unfavorable genotypes, a progressively increased gene-dose effect was observed in lung adenocarcinoma. We also found that individuals exposed to cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> showed a relatively high risk of lung cancer, but no interactions were found between cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fume</b> exposure or passive smoking exposure with these SNPs, either on an additive scale or a multiplicative scale. Overall, this is the first study showing that rs 7813 and rs 595961 could be meaningful as genetic markers for lung cancer risk...|$|R
50|$|In December 1942 the US Army Transportation Corps (USATC) {{replaced}} the British and Empire force operating the Southern Division. In 165 miles (266 km) the line has 144 tunnels, in which smoke and <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> created {{harsh working conditions}} for steam locomotive crews. A limited water supply throughout the route and the hot climate of the southern plains formed further difficulties for steam locomotive operation. The USATC therefore considered diesel-electric locomotives more suitable and requisitioned the 13 ALCO RS-1s built and had them converted to ALCO RSD-1 1,000 horsepower Co-Co locomotives. An additional 44 RSD-1s were built for use in Iran.

40|$|The <b>fume</b> {{of cooking}} <b>oil</b> has been {{reported}} to increase the risk of respiratory tract cancer. The influence of a degumming treatment of peanut oil on the contents of mutagenic compounds in fumes from heated peanut oil was investigated. The results indicate that the peanut oil prepared from roasted peanut kernels which underwent degumming treatment had a lower free fatty acid (FFA) content and a higher smoke point, was more clear in color, and produced less fumes when heated at smoke point. Moreover, when compared to untreated peanut oil, the mutagenicity of <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> of degummed peanut oil toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 was reduced to 81 % and 73 % (p< 0. 05), respectively. The degummed peanut oil which was obtained by adding 3 % water and heating at 60 &DEG;C for 20 min produced the least amount of mutagenic fume. The contents of four mutagenic compounds, trans-trans- 2, 4 -decadienal (t-t- 2, 4 -DDE), trans-trans- 2, 4 -nonadienal (t-t- 2, 4 -NDE), trans- 2 -decenal (t- 2 -DCA), and trans- 2 -undecenal (t- 2 -UDA) in <b>oil</b> <b>fumes</b> of degummed peanut oils were drastically decreased (p< 0. 05), especially the t-t- 2, 4 -DDE. The results also indicate that the FFA content had a high linear correlation with mutagenicity (r(2) = 0. 9978) and content of t-t- 2, 4 -DDE (r(2) = 0. 7685). Moreover, there was a correlation (r(2) = 0. 7816) between the content and the mutagenicity of t-t- 2, 4 -DDE. The decrease of FFA by degumming might explain the reduction of mutagenic alkenal compounds and mutagenicity of fumes from heated peanut oil. (C) 2003 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate cardiac autonomic changes associated with acute exposures to airborne particulates. Methods: High fidelity 12 -lead ECG (CardioSoft, Houston, TX) was acquired from 19 (10 male / 9 female) non-smoking volunteers (age 33. 6 +/- 6. 6 yrs) during 10 minutes pre-exposure, exposure and post-exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fumes,</b> wood smoke and sham (water vapor). To control exposure levels, noise, subject activity, and temperature, all studies were conducted inside an environmental chamber. Results: The short-term fractal scaling exponent (Alpha- 1) and the ratio of low frequency to high frequency Heart Rate Variability (HRV) powers (LF/HF, a purported sympathetic index) were both higher in males (p< 0. 017 and p< 0. 05, respectively) whereas approximate entropy (ApEn) and HF/(LF+HF) (a purported parasympathetic index) were both lower in males (p< 0. 036, and p< 0. 044, respectively). Compared to pre-exposure (p< 0. 0002) and sham exposure (p< 0. 047), male heart rates were elevated during early ETS post-exposure. Our data suggest that, in addition to tonic HRV gender differences, cardiac responses to some acute airborne particulates are gender related...|$|R
