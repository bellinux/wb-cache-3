40|$|This {{article is}} {{motivated}} by the following local-to-global question: is every variety with tame quotient singularities globally the quotient <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>variety</b> by <b>a</b> finite group? We show that this question has a positive answer for all quasi-projective varieties which are expressible as <b>a</b> quotient <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>variety</b> by <b>a</b> split torus (e. g. simplicial toric varieties). Although simplicial toric varieties are rarely toric quotients of smooth varieties by finite groups, we give an explicit procedure for constructing the quotient structure using toric techniques. This result follow from <b>a</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> which are expressible as the quotient <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>variety</b> by <b>a</b> split torus. As <b>an</b> additional application <b>of</b> this characterization, we show that <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> with abelian quotient singularities may fail to be <b>a</b> quotient <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>variety</b> by <b>a</b> finite abelian group. Concretely, we show that P^ 2 /A_ 5 is not expressible as <b>a</b> quotient <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>variety</b> by <b>a</b> finite abelian group. Comment: Updated to match published version.
