5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} the arrival <b>of</b> <b>Europeans</b> in its range.

5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number <b>of</b> <b>Europeans</b> has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE.

The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface.

5|$|The Late Middle Ages {{was marked}} by {{difficulties}} and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third <b>of</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts {{that occurred in the}} kingdoms.

5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival <b>of</b> <b>Europeans</b> in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands.

In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E
