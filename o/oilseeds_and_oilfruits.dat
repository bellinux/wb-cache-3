40|$|As grains {{competed with}} <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> other crops for land induced by high grain {{procurement}} prices, {{production of the}} four major <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> hence, China’s total oilseeds, declined in 1996. China will become a net importer of <b>oilseeds,</b> oil, <b>and</b> oil meal in 1996 / 97. While total oil imports in 1996 / 97 will be still lower than the level of 1994 / 95, <b>oilseed</b> <b>and</b> oil meal imports are expected to more than double. In 1996 / 97, the United States will reduce soy oil exports to China, but U. S. soybeans and soybean meal exports to China will increase. In the coming year, China will be a growing market for <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>oilseed</b> products. [Xinshen Diao, (202) 219 - 0690] A drop in production of the three major <b>oilseeds</b> (cotton-seed, rapeseed <b>and</b> peanuts) reduced China’s total oilseeds production by 5. 3 percent in 1996. Higher procurement prices for corn, rice, and wheat induced many farmers to switch cropland from oilseed to grain production. In 1997, total <b>oilseed</b> planted area <b>and</b> production will remain be-low 1995 ’s record levels but higher than 1996 ’s levels. I...|$|R

We have to have worked hard systematically to prove our credential with regards to <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses. India is the world leader in production, consumption and import as well in case of pulses and not for behind in vegetable oils. India imports 2 - 3 Mt of pulses on regular basis and 9. 2 Mt of vegetable oils during 2010 - 11. Currently India is in the mid-way of self-sustaining in <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses production. By the 2050, India as a whole {{will be able to}} sustain their production. Indian will produced plenty with respect to both the non-food commodity i. e. <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{total and}} phytic phosphorus and endogenous phytase activity in cereals, <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> by-products, feed ingredients used in animal {{production in the}} tropics were evaluated. The cereals and by-products were yellow corn, sorghum, hard wheat, broken rice, wheat bran, fine and gross defatted corn germ and bran, and rice polishing; the <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> by-products were cotton seed and cotton meal, and soy, palm oil and coconut meals. In five samples of each ingredient, phytic acid was measured by a colorimetric procedure and phytase activity with an enzymatic-colorimetric method. In addition, mineral and chemical components were determined by conventional methods. Crude protein, ether extract, ash and mineral content were similar to values reported in feed composition tables. Total P concentration in cereal grains and by-products ranged from 0. 12 to 1. 57 %, <b>and</b> in <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> by-products, from 0. 43 to 1. 34 %. In cereals <b>and</b> <b>oilseeds,</b> phytic acid concentrations varied from 0. 08 to 0. 49 %, and in by-products, from 0. 24 to 1. 13 %. Significant regressions were found between total and phytic P in cereals and by-products, <b>and</b> in <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> by-products. In the former, correlations were also found between phytic P and Mg, K and Ca content. Phytase activity (U/kg) was significantly higher in wheat (1565).

40|$|Abstract: Many WTO member {{countries}} have {{expressed interest in}} a “zero-for-zero ” (ZFZ) policy regime for <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>oilseed</b> products which entails removing all import tariffs and export taxes. A ZFZ policy would have substantial implications not only for oilseed trade flows {{but also for the}} composition of trade given the high disparity in tariff levels between OECD and non-OECD countries and high tariff escalation between <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> products for most countries. To examine the implications of the ZFZ regime on <b>oilseed</b> trade <b>and</b> welfare, the GTAP model was modified to allow for multi-product structure fitted to the joint production of oilseed processing. Using GTAP V 5, a special purpose disaggregation of the “oilseed products ” into “edible oils ” and “meals ” was also performed. A simulation of ZFZ regime shows a significantly greater expansion of global trade in edible oils compared to oilseeds while meals show little trade increase. While there is relatively little growth in imports by Japan and the EU...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} the key characteristics of temporal patterns of root growth during the crop development period, {{as well as}} the vertical patterns of root distribution in the soil profile for important <b>oilseed</b> <b>and</b> pulse crops grown on the semiarid Canadian Prairie. Rooting characteristics greatly influence the nutrient acquisition and water-use patterns for any plants. However, crop root systems have not been studied intensively due to time, labor and costs constraints. In the literature, root studies mostly focus on cereal crops and very limited information is available for <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses even though these broadleaf crops are critical in the diversification of cropping systems. Thus the objectives of this study were to 1) examine the root morphological characteristics, root distribution patterns in the soil profile, and the fine root distributions of <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses in comparison with wheat; 2) to determine the rhizospheric properties of pulse crops. In 2006 and 2007, canola (Brassica napus L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), field pea (Pisum sativumL., lentil (Lens culinaris), and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown under low- (natural rainfall) and high-water (rainfall+irrigation) conditions in southwest Saskatchewan. Roots were sampled at the seedling, early-flower, late-flower, late-pod, and physiological maturity growth stages, and root parameters determined using image analysis. The growth of roots progressed markedly from seedling to late-flowering and then declined to maturity. Root growth of pulse crops was not significantly affected by water conditions, but canola had 70 % greater root length, 67 % more root surface area, and 79 % more root tips under high-water than under low-water conditions. At the late-flower stage, over 70 % of the roots in <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses were distributed within the 0 - 60 cm soil profile and the largest proportion (around 50 %) were found in the top 20 -cm of the soil depth. About 85 % of the roots in <b>oilseeds</b> <b>and</b> pulses were classified as “extra fine” (diamete...|$|R

A market access variable that was obtained by dividing the total value of U. S soybean and corn exports to China by U. S agricultural G. D.
