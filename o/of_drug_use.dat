5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> or even permanently.|$|E

5|$|There's a Riot Goin' On is {{the fifth}} studio album by American band Sly and the Family Stone. It was {{released}} on November 20, 1971, by Epic Records. The album was recorded during 1970 and 1971 at Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, California, with sessions dominated by band frontman Sly Stone during a period <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and intra-group tension. There's a Riot Goin' On embraced a darker and more challenging sound than the optimistic psychedelic soul style of the group's previous records, making use of hard funk rhythms, primitive drum machines, excessive overdubbing, and unconventional mixing techniques. The album's planned title was Africa Talks to You, but it was retitled in response to Marvin Gaye's album What's Going On (1971), released five months before.|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and crime is well {{established}} in academic, policy and treatment, particularly the idea that <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> causes crime, despite {{the nature of the}} drug-crime relationship varying between sub-groups <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> offenders and not existing at all for the majority <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> non-offenders 1. Research suggests the amount of crime attributable to <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> has been over exaggerated. There is a dearth of research examining the drug-crime relationship between non-treatment and non-offender samples, particularly in the UK. There is also less research examining the notion that both <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and crime are caused by other (third) factors compared to the research examining the idea that <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> causes crime. Thus this research aims to compare a group <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> offenders (n= 149) with a group <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> non-offenders (n= 111) on a number of childhood risk factors (perceived parenting, negative life-events and impulsivity), school and peer variables, as well as their coping to strategies. The aim is to ascertain if criminality among drug users is attributable to these other (third) factors, instead <b>of</b> their <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> causing the crime to facilitate a more in depth understanding of the relationship between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and offending. Group comparisons followed by regression analyses were employed to examine whether any variables predicted group membership (<b>drug</b> <b>using</b> offender or a <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> non-offender), while age, job and <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> severity were controlled for. A high number of negative life events experienced before age 18, earlier age <b>of</b> onset for <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> always being in trouble with the police with friends, receiving no qualifications from school, being expelled from school and behavioural avoidant coping predicted being a <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> offender, while the reasons for initiating <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (out <b>of</b> curiosity and to socialise with friends) predicted being a <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> non-offender. The results show significant differences exist between drug users that go on to become offenders and drug users who do not, and these differences are attributable to offending/non-offending status rather than <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> The implications for treatment and policy are considered...|$|R
