A topology <b>optimisation</b> <b>study</b> is performed {{for the first time}} on the web of a steel I-section beam. A beam web design is then proposed based on the results of the topology <b>optimisation</b> <b>study.</b> A nonlinear finite element analysis technique is employed to determine the load carrying performance of the optimised beam in comparison to the conventional, widely used, cellular type beam. It is found that the optimised beam over performs in terms of load carrying capacities and stress intensities. Barriers to the implementation of the topology optimisation technique to the routine design of beam web are highlighted. In detail, a parametric topology <b>optimisation</b> <b>study</b> is conducted in order to determine the optimum opening topology for the wide range of beam cross sections that are found in practice. Thereafter, a generalised optimum web opening configuration is suggested based on the results of the parametric study.

In this {{document}} the reduced order simulation and optimisation of the passive suspension systems of a locally produced forty ton {{articulated dump truck}} is discussed. The linearization of the suspension parameters were validated using two and three dimensional MATLAB models. A 24 degree-of-freedom, three dimensional ADAMS/VIEW model with linear parameters was developed and compared to measured data {{as well as with}} simulation results from a more complex 50 degree-of-freedom non-linear ADAMS/CAR model. The ADAMS/VIEW model correlated in some aspects better with the experimental data than an existing higher order ADAMS/CAR model and was used in the suspension system <b>optimisation</b> <b>study.</b> The road profile over which the vehicle was to prove its comfort was generated, from a spatial PSD (Power Spectral Density), to be representative of a typical haul road. The weighted RMS (Root Mean Squared) and VDV (Vibration Dose Value) values are used in the objective function for the <b>optimisation</b> <b>study.</b> The optimisation was performed by four different algorithms and an improvement of 30 % in ride comfort for the worst axis was achieved on the haul road.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is currently experiencing a {{growth rate of}} about 4 % per annum and this trend {{is expected to continue}} into the future. One concern about this growth rate is the impact it will have on the environment particularly in terms of emissions of CO 2, NOx and relatively recently also cirrus clouds induced by contrails. The ACARE has set emissions reduction targets of 50 % reduction of CO 2 and noise and 80 % reduction of NOx by 2020 relative to Y 2000 technology. Clean Sky and other large EU collaborative projects have been launched in an effort to identify new, more efficient, aircraft and engine technologies, greener operational and asset management practices and lower life cycle emissions. This PhD research was funded by and contributed to the Systems for Green Operations Integrated Technology Demonstrator (SGO-ITD) of the Clean Sky project. The key contribution to knowledge of this research is the development and application of a methodology for simultaneous optimisation of aircraft trajectories and engine cycles. Previous studies on aircraft trajectory <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies,</b> published in the public domain, are based on relatively low fidelity models. The case studies presented in this thesis are multi-objective and based on higher fidelity, verified aircraft, engine and emissions models and also include assessments of conceptual engines with conceptual LPP combustors. The first task involved the development of reactor based NOx emission prediction models for a conventional aero gas turbine combustor and a novel conceptual lean pre-mixed pre-vaporised combustor. A persistent contrails prediction model was also developed. A multi-disciplinary framework comprising a genetic algorithm based optimiser integrated with an engine performance, an aircraft performance and an emission prediction model was then developed. The framework was initially used to perform multi-disciplinary aircraft trajectory <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> and subsequently both aircraft trajectory and engine cycle <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> simultaneously to assess trade-offs between mission fuel burn, flight time, NOx production and persistent contrails formation [...] .

Both AC adsorption and US cavitation were investigated individually, in series and operating {{them in a}} combined way. The efficiency of above processes has been evaluated in terms of removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). For the individual operation, the <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> were carried out by using the following conditions: AC dosage (50 – 200 g/L); contact time (2, 4, 6 h); US power amplitude (50 % and 80 %) and US cavitation time (30 – 180 min). The <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> utilising US power amplitude (50 %) and cavitation time (15 min) followed by AC adsorption using minimum AC dosage (50 g/L) and contact time (30 min) resulted in ∼ 100 % COD and 83. 33 % TSS removals which meets the discharge limits set by the Department of Environment (DoE), Malaysia. The hybrid operation was also studied by simultaneously employing AC adsorption and US cavitation and {{it was observed that}} an adsorption dosage of 50 g/L resulted into achieving 73. 08 % COD and 98. 33 % TSS removals within 15 min of US irradiation.

The aerodynamics of the flow within the slot is complex and this, together with the placement of the fuel holes with cross injection, controls the mixing of the fuel and air. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the Shear Stress Transport (k-ω) turbulence model was used for flow and mixing predictions within the radial swirler slot and for conducting a CFD-based Design of Experiments (DOE) <b>optimisation</b> <b>study,</b> in which different parameters related to the fuel injection holes were varied.

Consequently, the optimised mixing configuration obtained from the above study was experimentally tested on an atmospheric test facility. The mixing patterns from experiments at various axial locations across the slot are in good agreement with the mixing predictions from the optimal CFD model.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades public {{transport}} demand patterns in South African metropolitan areas have changed considerably due to market forces such as urban decentralisation and informal settlement on the urban fringes. Public transport services did not respond to these changing demand patterns in an optimal way and great potential exists to optimise the route network of bus and minibus taxi services. In view of changing demand patterns and the need for metropolitan authorities to develop an integrated multi-modal public transport plan in terms of the new National Land Transport Bill, three authorities applied a public transport route optimisation model to assist in the optimisation of bus and taxi route networks. The DHV Route Optimisation model, developed in the Netherlands, was transferred to South Africa for these studies. The model determines the most optimal set of road based routes, subject to resource constraints, by minimising the total travel time and number of transfers between routes. The paper defines the need for route optimisation in South Africa, describes the DHV model and adjustments made to suit South African conditions, and presents the main results of the route <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> conducted in the Greater Pretoria, Khayalami and Port Elizabeth metropolitan areas. Finally, recommendations are made regarding the route optimisation methodology to be adopted in South Africa in view of lessons learned from the three applications.

40|$|Blast <b>optimisation</b> <b>studies</b> were {{conducted}} at an opencast coal mine in India for {{selection of a}} site specific explosive for different rock types. This seismic refraction survey technique was applied at sandstone benches of a coal mine for rock mass characterisation and blast optimisation by impedance matching of explosives. Field experiments {{were conducted}} on seismic profiling to characterise sandstone rock mass {{on the basis of}} P-wave velocity (Vp) measurements. The running benches were selected for the experimentation so as to cross check the results of the Vp with the exposed faces of the benches. The instrument used for seismic profiling contains 24 geophones of 14 Hz frequency. The mode of survey was the „refraction method‟ which could give the Vp profile up to 50 - 60 m depth and about 100 m stretch. The source of vibration generation was by hammering of specific Sledge hammer. The raw seismic data collected in the field was analysed by a software called ‟Seismic imager‟ for generating a Vp profile of the rock strata. The Vp profiles were determined for three benches of the mine, which include weak, medium and hard type of rock mass. The rock impedance was calculated based on the Vp determined by seismic profiling. This data was used for the selection of explosive with desired velocity of detonation and density, so as to match the impedance of the rock mass. The blast performance with the suitable explosives with impedance matching was obviously better than that of impedance mismatching. Trials were also conducted with heave energy-rich ANFO explosive with mismatched impedance properties and observed better results.
