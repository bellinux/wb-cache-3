5000|$|The most {{noticeable}} difference between porcelain {{and the other}} pottery clays is that it [...] "wets" [...] very quickly (that is, added water has a noticeably greater effect on the plasticity for porcelain than <b>other</b> <b>clays),</b> and that it tends to continue to [...] "move" [...] longer than <b>other</b> <b>clays,</b> requiring experience in handling to attain optimum results. During medieval times in Europe, porcelain was very expensive and in high demand for its beauty. TLV mirrors also date from the Han dynasty.|$|E

50|$|Similar to many <b>other</b> <b>clays,</b> {{montmorillonite}} swells {{with the}} addition of water. Montmorillonites expand considerably more than <b>other</b> <b>clays</b> due to water penetrating the interlayer molecular spaces and concomitant adsorption. The amount of expansion is due largely to the type of exchangeable cation contained in the sample. The presence of sodium as the predominant exchangeable cation can result in the clay swelling to several times its original volume. Hence, sodium montmorillonite has come to be used as the major constituent in nonexplosive agents for splitting rock in natural stone quarries in an effort to limit the amount of waste, or for the demolition of concrete structures where the use of explosive charges is unacceptable.|$|E

50|$|The name Furzebrook {{derives from}} the furze/gorse and a brook. The first use of the name was {{probably}} by Furzebrook Farm.

50|$|Another {{available}} alloy, EZ960™ Sterling Silver Metal Clay {{was invented}} by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at 1675 °F / 913 °C - 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than <b>other</b> <b>clays,</b> at 10-11%.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} groups of clay: layer silicates; {{crystalline}} chain silicates; metal oxides and hydroxides and oxy-oxides; and amorphous; and allophanes. Most clays are crystalline {{and most are}} made up of three or four planes of oxygen held together by planes of aluminium and silicon by way of ionic bonds that together form a single layer of clay. The spatial arrangement of the oxygen atoms determines clay's structure. Half of the weight of clay is oxygen, but on a volume basis oxygen is ninety percent. The layers of clay are sometimes held together through hydrogen bonds or potassium bridges and as a result will swell less in the presence of water. <b>Other</b> <b>clays,</b> such as montmorillonite, have layers that are loosely attached and will swell greatly when water intervenes between the layers.|$|E
50|$|This breathtaking sight is {{composed}} of 7 different colours, all of which derive from different types of rocks; leading to its diverse range of colours. Each colour/rock is also said to have formed during different time periods. Firstly, pink {{is believed to be}} composed of red clay, mudstone (mud) and arilitas (sand). Its estimated age goes back about 3 to 4 million years. The shade of white surrounding the pink is mostly made up of limestone and is aged about 400 million years. Continuing onto the mix of brown and purples, which are composed of lead, and rich in calcium carbonate, and is 80 to 90 million years of age. On top of the purple-brown colour, there is an earthy brown colour that has been detected in the rock. The rocks making up this colour are the most recent colours appearing on the rocks, aging at 1 to 2 million years old, and is described as ‘fanglomerate composed of rock with manganese belonging to Quaternary.’ As for the red, which {{is composed}} of claystones (iron) and <b>other</b> <b>clays</b> belonging to the upper Tertiary, its said to also be aged around 3 to 4 millions years. The shades of green, aging at about 600 million years, are made up of phyllites, and slates of copper oxide. Finally, the yellow mustard colour is made of sandstones with sulfur, and is estimated at 80 to 90 million years.|$|E

40|$|Clay {{samples from}} three towns in Kogi state were {{examined}} {{with the aim}} of determining their chemical composition as well as testing for their suitability as refractory insulating materials for local furnaces. Refractories are required for many other industries in Nigeria like in chemical, ceramic, petrochemical, oil,foundry and iron and steel industries.

Apart from the natural occurring fire clays which has been adjudged an insulating refractories, <b>other</b> <b>clays</b> can have their insulating characteristics improved by the addition of materials like saw dust, rice husks and other farm wastes. Experiments were carried out to determine how the addition of groundnut shell could improve the refractory properties of clay samples from Kogi State.

40|$|Five clayey {{materials}} from two quarries {{located in the}} Amezmiz region (Morocco) were sampled and investigated for their physical, chemical, mineralogical and thermal characteristics to evaluate their potential suitability as raw materials in various ceramic applications. Physical properties were identified by particle size distribution, consistency limits and total organic content. Chemical, mineralogical, and thermal properties were investigated by XRF, XRD, and TG/DTA techniques, respectively. A common raw material in pottery manufacturing of Morocco was used as reference sample (REF). Results show that the main oxides in the samples were SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and Fe 2 O 3, whereas the other oxides were present only in small quantities. Quartz, illite and vermiculite were present as dominant mineral phases with minor kaolinite, calcite and smectite.
