5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses {{the question of}} why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> planets is also {{an important}} problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E

5|$|The {{impacting}} object {{probably had}} a mass {{comparable to that of}} Mars, and the impact probably occurred {{near the end of the}} period <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> impacts.

5|$|A 1940 {{expedition}} by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more fossils <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> crocodilians, {{this time}} from Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name Phobosuchus riograndensis. Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> sequoia, {{and other}} damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.

Divergence between the two recognized species <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} regarding the original language of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Giants.</b> The Book <b>of</b> <b>Giants</b> was generally believed {{to have had a}} Semitic origin.

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity <b>of</b> <b>giant</b> planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
