As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> horseback. The students gathered around Nelson's Column, where the ringleaders climbed onto its base to make speeches.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E

A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|At {{a series}} of {{high-level}} meetings in May, the Big Six first seriously discussed ending the war—but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> terms {{that would have been}} acceptable to the Allies. Because anyone openly supporting Japanese surrender risked assassination by zealous army officers, the meetings were closed to anyone except the Big Six, the Emperor, and the Privy Seal—no second- or third-echelon officers could attend. At these meetings, despite the dispatches from Japanese ambassador Satō in Moscow, only Foreign minister Tōgō realized that Roosevelt and Churchill might have already made concessions to Stalin to bring the Soviets into the war against Japan. As a result of these meetings, Tōgō was authorized to approach the Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its neutrality, or (despite the very remote probability) to form an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E

Along with Steve Cishek of the Miami Marlins, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Co-Player of the Week {{for the period of}} July 21 to July 27 after allowing only one earned run in two starts that week. He was named the NL Rookie of the Month for July. On August 11, deGrom went on the disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis. Rafael Montero was called up on August 12 in deGrom's place. On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s to make room for deGrom coming off the disabled list.|$|E

In July 1912, {{he returned to his}} alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.|$|E

Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.|$|E
5|$|For {{her first}} patrol from Lorient and her seventh overall, U-38 would again {{be under the}} command of Heinrich Liebe. She {{departed}} on 25 September, for the Northwest Approaches. She would attack five ships on this patrol, sinking four <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> 1 October, the British motor freighter MV Highland Patriot was torpedoed. After two weeks of no victories, U-38 was successful against the Greek steam freighter SS Aenos on 17 October, sailing as part of Convoy SC 7, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to England. The following day, the British steam freighter SS Carsbreck was damaged, but not sunk, while traveling with the SC-7 convoy from Sydney to Grimsby, England. On 19 October, two ships were hit, both sailing as part of the HX 79 convoy: the Dutch SS Bilderdijk and the British steam freighter SS Matheran. Following these victories, U-38 returned to Lorient on 24 October 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior.

Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark to be one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> land.

5|$|Kesselring {{used the}} Jews of Rome as slave labour on the {{construction}} of fortifications – as he had earlier done with those of Tunis. When ordered to deport the Roman Jews, Kesselring resisted. He announced that no resources were available to carry out such an order. Hitler then transferred responsibility to the SS. About 2,000 Roman Jews were ultimately deported between October 1943 and June 1944, half <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> 16 October 1943. During the German occupation of Italy, the Germans were believed to have killed some 46,000 Italian civilians, including 7,000 Jews.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M.

It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
