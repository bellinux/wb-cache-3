A <b>outdoor</b> <b>canopy</b> was added to the third deck in 1996 and in 1999 she received upgraded finishes and seating to the interior passenger lounge. Her main passenger lounge was recently renovated in 2013 with new carpeting and seating.|$|E
5000|$|MaryJane’s Outpost, {{published}} by Clarkson Potter on June 24, 2008, is a romanticized and feminine look at camping, farming, and outdoor activities. [...] Projects include building willow furniture, sleeping in <b>outdoor</b> <b>canopy</b> beds, using outdoor bathtubs, fishing, and hunting. The book {{is divided into}} three major sections: [...] "Outbound" [...] … going out to the yard, engaging children in the outside world, making natural gifts and creating family rituals, such as the simple act of having tea outside; [...] "Outrigged" [...] … weekend camping and picnics, enjoying fishing or hunting; and [...] "Outstepping" [...] … backpacking, enjoying wild foods, being safe in the water and wild, and outdoor jobs. The New York Times Book Review had this to say: [...] "MaryJane Butters was once a single mother of two and a forest ranger, among other tough jobs. She is now an organic farmer, a grandmother, and an activist, living on a farm in Northern Idaho ... MaryJane’s Outpost: Unleashing Your Inner Wild is her third book, and it’s a dilly. It lures readers outdoors with its Ralph Lauren styling (Ms. Butters’s long blond braid and handsome weathered face are complemented by an atmospheric tractor) and instructions on how to do all sorts of things, like make willow furniture and build an outdoor bed or bathtub ... Ms. Butters has a way with words: Glamping, or glamour camping, one of her pet concepts, is about “the juxtaposition of rugged and really pretty, grit and glam, diesel and absolutely darling,” she writes." ...|$|E
40|$|In real <b>outdoor</b> <b>canopy</b> profile detection, the {{accuracy}} of a LIDAR scanner to measure canopy structure is affected by a potentially uneven road condition. The level of error associated with attitude angles from undulations in the ground surface can be reduced by developing appropriate correction algorithm. This paper proposes an offline attitude angle offset correction algorithm based on a 3 D affine coordinate transformation. The validity of the correction algorithm is verified by conducting an indoor experiment. The experiment was conducted on an especially designed canopy profile measurement platform. During the experiment, an artificial tree and a tree-shaped carved board were continuously scanned at constant laser scanner travel speed and detection distances under simulated bumpy road conditions. Acquired LIDAR laser scanner raw data was processed offline by exceptionally developed MATLAB program. The obtained results before and after correction method show that the single attitude angle offset correction method is able to correct the distorted data points in tree-shaped carved board profile measurement, with a relative error of 5 %, while the compound attitude angle offset correction method is effective to reduce the error associated with compound attitude angle deviation from the ideal scanner pose, with relative error of 7 %...|$|E

50|$|Nestor Topchy, Rick Lowe, and Dean Ruck {{moved to}} a six-acre site on Feagan Street in the West End to fashion {{one of the most}} {{energetic}} communal art projects in the city. The site included several living spaces, a theater, a communal kitchen, gardens, several warehouse spaces for studios, and an <b>outdoor</b> stage and <b>canopy</b> used as a drive-in movie theater for up to thirty-five cars. Many artists lived and worked there, including Jim Pirtle, Andy Mann, Michael Battey, Fritz Welch, Mario Perez, and Giles Lyon. Initially called Meaux’s Bayou,Topchy changed the compound’s name to Zocalo, and then to TemplO as it grew and transformed.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project was undertaken {{to achieve a}} better understanding of the microclimatic characteristics of the outdoor and indoor environments of school buildings in the UK through the mediation of transitional spaces. Improvements in thermal comfort outdoors around buildings and reductions in energy demand for indoor spaces are two possible contributions of transitional outdoor spaces located adjacent to classrooms or other indoor spaces. The effects of these two functions must be considered jointly so that improved performance in one does not compromise performance of the other. The underlying hypothesis is that the transitional outdoor space can affect environmental conditions in ways that can enhance both the outdoor thermal comfort of occupants and their appreciation of the space and have the potential to reduce the energy demand (e. g. for lighting and space heating) of the building. Moreover, while interest in outdoor pedagogy has been growing in schools, outdoor spaces are rarely equipped to provide for such activity. The microclimate of the transitional outdoor space as an architecturally potential space is therefore central to the ways in which teachers and students can be encouraged to use the space frequently as an extended classroom without adversely affecting the indoor environment. The project focuses on the architectural elements of the transitional outdoor space and aims to reveal its environmental impact on both the outdoor and indoor spaces, and to propose design considerations. Transitional spaces are considered mainly as taking the form of a canopy. Understanding the dynamic environmental processes impinging on these spaces will assist in designing spaces that can support functional use throughout the year. Fieldwork conducted at Effra Nursery School, London focused on the environmental performance of an <b>outdoor</b> <b>canopy</b> and play area adjacent to the classroom. Based on the results of the fieldwork and using well established computer models, simulations were performed to identify the influence of different parameters: that of having a canopy; the effect of the transmissivity of the canopy material (three transparencies 0 %, 50 %, 90 % were considered), the operability of the canopy, orientation (four orientations N,E,S,W were considered), and location (three cities: London, Manchester, Glasgow). The combined effects of canopy transparency and orientation were shown to be critical design considerations in affecting comfort conditions in both indoor and outdoor spaces. The exception was when the canopy was not fixed but operable. It was found that outdoor comfort conditions in the transitional outdoor space can be enhanced by 13. 8 % by choosing a canopy of 0 % transparency compared with a reference case without a canopy, while it could be enhanced by 27. 8 % using a movable type of canopy in the case of a south facing classroom in London. Daylight and heating energy demand, however, can worsen by 40 % and 50 % respectively with a fixed canopy, while they could improve by between 23 % and 45 % using the movable canopy. The fixed canopy with a higher transparency can help to increase outdoor thermal comfort in Glasgow, while one with a lower transparency shows better performance if facinq south in London. The work clearly demonstrates that the architectural design of the transitional space plays an important part in the resulting environmental conditions indoors and outdoors. Using established simulation tools in new ways this {{research project}} has quantified the combined effects of external canopies on occupant thermal comfort and on classroom energy demand for space heating and lighting. These have been documented for different canopy characteristics and different UK locations thus providing design guidelines for the provision of such transitional space in school buildings.
