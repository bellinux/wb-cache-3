2500|$|Rehabilitation {{work on the}} {{westbound}} Downtown Tunnel (Norfolk to Portsmouth) {{began on}} August 9, 2013. The plan initially called for closing the tunnel on about 25 consecutive weekends from 8 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, with traffic to be primarily detoured to the High Rise Bridge using I-464. One-lane closures were not feasible because most of this work required <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> (such as installing the fireproofing on the ceiling), or work that would cross the centerline. But after several weekends of closures, public outcry from businesses and citizens of Portsmouth forced VDOT and ERC to reconsider the plan. Portsmouth City Council asked VDOT to look at turning the eastbound tunnel into a two-way tunnel during the weekend closures, an idea VDOT and ERC had initially ruled out, insisting that [...] "maintaining two lanes of eastbound traffic in the eastbound Downtown Tunnel while directing westbound traffic towards {{one of the four}} alternative routes (with the I-64 High Rise Bridge as the primary detour) is the best course of action, both for the Project and the traveling public." [...] Eventually, ERC changed the plan from full weekend closures to nightly closures from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.|$|E

40|$|We present {{performance}} {{evaluations of}} parallel-for loop with work stealing technique. The parallel-for by work stealing transforms the parallel-loop {{into a form}} of binary tree by making use of method of divide-and-conquer. Iterations are distributed in the leaves proce- dures of the binary tree, and the parallel executions are performed by stealing subtrees {{from the bottom of}} the tree. The work stealing and divide-and-conquer are used to address the portability prob- lem in nested parallelism and composability. By work stealing and divide-and-conquer techniques, fine-grained parallel-for can be im- plemented without contributing large <b>work</b> <b>overhead.</b> Low <b>work</b> <b>overhead</b> is important as the number of processor could be less than expected. Low overhead and fine-grained of work stealing sched- uler makes highly parallel processor cores are able to scale the per- formance.

40|$|Abstract. Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) gives {{software}} de-velopers {{the opportunity}} to write parallel programs more easily compared to any previous programming method, and yields better performance than most previous lock-based synchronizations. Current implementations of HTM perform very well with small transac-tions. But when a transaction overflows the cache, these implementations either abort the transaction as unsuitable for HTM, and let software takeover, or revert to some much more inefficient hash-like in-memory structure, usually located in the userspace. We present a fast, scalable solution that has virtually no limit on trans-action size, has low transactional read and write <b>overhead,</b> <b>works</b> with physical addresses, and doesn't require any changes inside the cache sub-system. This paper presents an HTMOS- Operating System (OS) and Architec-ture modifications that leverage the existing OS Virtual Memory mecha-nisms, to support unbounded transaction sizes, and provide transaction execution speed that does not decrease when transaction grows...|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} {{rehabilitation}} work on the westbound Downtown Tunnel (Norfolk to Portsmouth) full weekend closures were needed of the tunnel for approximately 25 consecutive weekends.

ERC stated {{that most of the}} work either required <b>overhead</b> <b>work</b> (such as installing the fireproofing on the ceiling), or work that would cross the centerline, such that a one-lane closure was not feasible. After allowing closures to occur for several weekends, Portsmouth City Council asked VDOT and ERC {{to take a look at}} the plan and explore the idea of turning the eastbound tunnel into a two way tunnel during the weekend closure.
