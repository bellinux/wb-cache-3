5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athlete,</b> and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

5|$|Itte Detenamo participated on Nauru's behalf in the men's (105 kilogram) super-heavyweight weightlifting contest. He was the {{youngest}} person to represent Nauru at the London Games {{at the age of}} 25 and had participated for his country in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Detenamo qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2012 Oceania Weightlifting Championships in Apia, Samoa. His event took place on 7 August, and included 19 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Detenamo was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in all three of his attempts. He then attempted 205 kilograms during the clean and jerk phase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 215 kilograms on his second attempt, but was successful with 225 on his third. Overall the combination of Detenamo's highest scores in snatch (175) and clean and jerk (215) yielded a score of 390 points. He finished 14th in the event, ahead of Christian López of Guatemala (387 points) and behind Japan's Kazuomi Ota (400 points). Detenamo was 65 points behind the gold medallist Behdad Salimi of Iran. After the Games his coach Paul Coffa revealed Detenamo was carrying a minor shoulder injury and had been keen to perform well because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> being away from Nauru {{for a long period of}} time.|$|E

500|$|From its {{inception}} until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes {{consisted of a}} medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in. [...] For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation. [...] The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis. [...] It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation {{to an end in}} itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athlete.</b>|$|E

[...] One concern with this method was that the natural steroids produced by the human body may vary significantly based on the deuterium content of drinking water, leading to false detection of doping based on hydrogen isotope differences. [...] This concern has been addressed in a recent study which concluded that the effect of D/H ratio of drinking water did not pose an insurmountable source of error for this anti-doping testing strategy.|$|E

6000|$|The {{peculiarity}} of Mr. Stevenson is {{not only}} to have been a fantastic child, and to retain, in maturity, that fantasy ripened into imagination: he has also kept up the habit of dramatising everything, of playing, half consciously, many parts, of making the world [...] "an unsubstantial fairy place." [...] This turn of mind it is that causes his work occasionally to seem somewhat freakish. Thus, in the fogs and horrors of London, he plays at being an Arabian tale-teller, and his [...] "New Arabian Nights" [...] are a new kind of romanticism--Oriental, freakish, like the work of a changeling. Indeed, this curious genius, springing from a family of Scottish engineers, resembles nothing so much as one of the fairy children, whom the ladies of Queen Proserpina's court used to leave in the cradles of Border keeps or of peasants' cottages. Of the Scot he has little but the power of touching us with a sense of the supernatural, and a decided habit of moralising; for no Scot of genius has been more austere with Robert Burns. On the other hand, one element of Mr. Stevenson's ethical disquisitions is derived from his dramatic habit. His optimism, his gay courage, his habit of accepting the world as very well worth living in and looking at, persuaded one of his critics that he was a hard-hearted young athlete of iron frame. Now, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> he has nothing but his love of the open air: it is the eternal child that drives him to seek adventures and to sojourn among beach-combers and savages. Thus, an admiring but far from optimistic critic may doubt whether Mr. Stevenson's content with the world is not [...] "only his fun," [...] as Lamb said of Coleridge's preaching; whether he is but playing at being the happy warrior in life; whether he is not acting that part, himself to himself. At least, it is a part fortunately conceived and admirably sustained: a difficult part too, whereas that of the pessimist is as easy as whining.|$|E
