25|$|There are {{alternatives}} to a block heater that offer {{some of the}} same benefits. These include heaters attached to the engine's oil pan, usually with magnets. Dipstick heaters can be installed in place of the engine's <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick.</b> Heated blankets are available for the entire engine area, as well. A timer can be used with any of these heaters, so that it {{does not have to be}} left on all the time. This can help lower the electrical costs of using a block heater.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian word [...] "stiletto" [...] {{comes from}} the Latin stilus, the thin pointed Roman writing {{instrument}} used to engrave wax or clay tablets in ancient times. [...] The stiletto began to gain fame during the late Middle Ages, when it was the secondary weapon of knights. [...] Originally designed as a purely offensive weapon, the stiletto was used to finish off a fallen or severely wounded heavily armored opponent. The needle-like blade could, if used with sufficient force, penetrate most mail or find its way through gaps in a knight's plate armor, and was narrow enough {{to pass through the}} eye slits of the helmeted knight. [...] A severely wounded opponent, who was not expected to survive, would be given a [...] "mercy strike" [...] (French coup de grâce), hence the name miséricorde. Later the Gunner's Stiletto became a tool for clearing cannon-fuse touch holes; used in the manner of an automotive <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick,</b> they were often inscribed with marks indicating levels of powder charges for ranging distance.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall design}} of the Metro vans {{remained}} somewhat unchanged from 1938 until 1964 when it was redesigned by the in-house design team in the Chicago Metro plant to be competitive with the Boyertown and Hackney vans. The corners were squared and an opening hood was added for easier access to coolant and <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick.</b> An eight-cylinder engine was also made available.|$|E
5000|$|Dipsticks {{can also}} be used to measure the {{quantity}} of liquid in an otherwise inaccessible space, by inserting and removing the stick and then checking the extent of it covered by the liquid. The most familiar example is the <b>oil</b> level <b>dipstick</b> found on most internal combustion engines.|$|R
5000|$|These engines have a 90° v-block with 12 valves {{activated}} by a pushrod valvetrain. All engines have cast iron blocks and cylinder heads. The engines {{are based on}} the Chevrolet Small-Block engine, and the V6 is formed by the removal of the #3 and #6 cylinders. The V6s share the same 4.4-inch bore spacing and 9.025-inch deck height as the V8 engines. Many parts are interchangeable between the 90° V6 and the small block V8 including valvetrain components, bearings, piston assemblies, lubrication and cooling system components, and external accessories. [...] The 90-degree V6 engine uses the same transmission bellhousing pattern as the Chevrolet small-block V8 engine. The <b>oil</b> pan <b>dipstick</b> is located on the passenger side above the oil pan rail; this design was phased in on both the V6-90 and Small Block Chevrolet assembly lines (for engines manufactured after 1979) sharing the same casting dies. All the engines use a 1-6-5-4-3-2 firing order. The engines in this family are longitudinal engines, and have been used in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks, industrial, and marine applications. As of 2012, the Chevrolet 90° V6 is currently produced at the GM Powertrain Division plant in Romulus, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|The 1974 model had a fatal engine flaw {{that caused}} steel powder and {{eventually}} {{half of the}} transmission <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> to drop into the transmission. The rubber stopper for the transmission oil fill hole allowed the dip stick to vibrate enough to contact the primary drive gear. If not caught within ~300 miles from new the bearings in the transmission would be ruined.|$|E
50|$|The {{oil filler}} tube for {{the engine is}} located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> and the power {{steering}} fluid reservoir (when fitted). Most vans had a twist-on/off gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was optional. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as the engine is in the back), just below the radiator.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{completion}} {{they were}} sent to Prototype Technology Group (PTG) Racing in Virginia for final preparation, which included {{the front and rear}} Motorsport flag decals, and [...] "trunk kit." [...] In the trunk there was a different oil pan with special oil pump with dual pickups as used on the European M3 and later on the E46 M3, longer <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> tube, front strut bar, lower x brace, spacer blocks to raise the rear wing, and an adjustable front splitter. Each new owner was given a 1-page legal document to sign stating that any installation of trunk items voided the new car warranty.|$|E
50|$|During the {{occupation}} of France in the Second World War, Boulanger refused to meet Dr. Ferdinand Porsche or communicate with the German authorities except through intermediaries. He organized a 'go slow' of production of trucks for the Wehrmacht, {{many of which were}} sabotaged at the factory, by putting the notch on the <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> in the wrong place resulting in engine seizure. In 1944 when the Gestapo headquarters in Paris was sacked by members of the French Resistance, his name was prominent on a German blacklist of the most important 'Enemies of the Reich' to be arrested {{in the event of an}} allied invasion of France.|$|E
50|$|The block {{underwent}} {{some changes}} since its inception. In 1971, deck height was extended from 9.480 in to 9.503 in (casting D1AE-6015-DA) {{to lower the}} compression ratio to reduce NOx emissions without the need to change piston or cylinder-head design. In 1974, a boss was added {{on the front of}} the right cylinder bank to mount the air injection pump (casting D4AE-A). In 1974, the <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> tube moved from the timing case to the skirt under the left cylinder bank near the rear of the casting. These details made swapping older blocks from passenger cars with front sump oil pans to more recent rear-sumped Mustang and LTD/Crown Vic Ford cars more difficult unless an oil pan had the dipstick mounted therein. In 1984, the rear main seal was changed from a two-piece component to a one-piece design.|$|E

5000|$|Originally it {{was fueled}} by a single barrel carburetor, later the engine was {{available}} with a twin choke carburetor and other modifications to increase its power. This variant was fitted in the 2000E version of the Corsair and the GT 2000 version of the Capri and Granada, in the Ford Capri this engine was fitted to the 2000GT and 1700GT Variants from 1969 to 1973 with the 2.0 L producing 92 hp (94 PS) at 5500 rpm and 141 Nm (100 - 123 lb/ft) of torque at 3600 rpm. In 1974, with the Introduction of the Capri II, it was replaced completely by the 2.0 litre TL20 OHC I4 {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Ford Pinto engine" [...] and the 2.0 L Ford Cologne V6 engine. The most powerful version of the Essex V4 was in the Ford Corsair 2000E Deluxe with 103 hp. Between 1971 and 1972 the Essex V4 & V6 engines were upgraded and the power output increased by using a different camshaft, changing the shape of the inlet ports from an O shape to a D shape and increasing the compression ratio slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1, other things were also changed, the <b>oil</b> <b>dipstick</b> was moved from the front to {{the left side of the}} engine, and the camshaft drive gear was made stronger by using steel construction with fibre teeth instead of being made completely from fibre like earlier versions. Many companies provide steel and alloy gears which are more dependable in high performance applications.|$|E
