5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken <b>orally</b> to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken <b>orally,</b> include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken <b>orally</b> are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is taken}} <b>orally,</b> and is absorbed well – 80% of {{alprazolam}} binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after {{one to two}} hours.|$|E
5|$|Chelating agents {{can have}} adverse effects; for example, {{chelation}} therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken <b>orally</b> {{can increase the}} body's absorption of lead through the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly <b>orally</b> active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} reported that adding {{large amounts of}} zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether <b>orally</b> consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{can come}} in the form of capsules, tablets or white powder that users may swallow, snort, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken <b>orally,</b> users {{reported}} they could feel the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken <b>orally</b> or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E
5|$|Polo related {{his memoirs}} <b>orally</b> to Rustichello da Pisa while both were prisoners of the Genova Republic. Rustichello wrote Devisement du Monde in Langues d'Oil, a lingua franca of crusaders and western merchants in the Orient. The idea {{probably}} {{was to create}} a handbook for merchants, essentially a text on weights, measures and distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known hatt-ı hümayun {{is the one}} sent by Sultan Murad I to Evrenos Bey in 1386, commending {{the commander}} for his conquests and giving him {{advice on how to}} administer people. Until the reign of Murad III, Viziers used to present matters <b>orally</b> to the Sultans, who would then give their consent or denial, also <b>orally.</b> While hatt-ı hümayuns were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as Abdülhamid I, Selim III and Mahmud II, who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything.|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered <b>orally.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{crime is}} {{committed}} if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience {{to the law}} or a lawful order, or is {{likely to lead to}} a breach of the peace. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm <b>orally,</b> in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. The {{same is true}} for aloe latex, which was taken <b>orally</b> for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam regular {{release and}} <b>orally</b> {{disintegrating}} tablets are available as 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg. Alprazolam oral solutions are available as 0.5mg/5 mL and as 1mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, povidone, sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given <b>orally</b> if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken <b>orally</b> undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Dalton <b>orally</b> {{presented}} his first list of relative atomic weights {{for a number}} of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures. The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of <b>orally</b> ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} the victory of Michael III over the Rus' was invented by the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became {{generally}} accepted in the Slavic chronicles influenced by them. However, {{the memory of the}} successful campaign was transmitted <b>orally</b> among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of Oleg's 907 campaign, which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted <b>orally.</b> In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|So far, no fossil of Plateosaurus {{has been}} found with gastroliths (gizzard stones) in the stomach area. The old, widely cited idea that all large dinosaurs, implicitly also Plateosaurus, {{swallowed}} gastroliths to digest food because of their relatively limited {{ability to deal with}} food <b>orally</b> has been refuted by a study on gastrolith abundance, weight, and surface structure in fossils compared to alligators and ostriches by Oliver Wings. The use of gastroliths for digestion seems to have developed on the line from basal theropods to birds, with a parallel development in Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A {{number of the}} stories in the narrative parts of the Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It {{is possible that the}} information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from <b>orally</b> transmitted tales that were written down.|$|E
5|$|The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer {{did not have}} the high status of the Confucian scholar-officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge had been passed down <b>orally</b> for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government.|$|E
5|$|The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer were {{not seen as}} professionally {{equal to that of}} a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had been passed down <b>orally</b> for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder Cai Xiang (1012–1067) in medieval Fujian province.|$|E
5|$|The {{substances}} {{are applied}} to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered <b>orally,</b> through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.|$|E
5|$|While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter {{manages to}} slip out and goes after Connors as Spider-Man. While trying to {{communicate}} with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, and underneath it. Finally, Spider-Man falls off the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to the lab and is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors <b>orally.</b> He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it <b>orally</b> (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{literary}} genre called setsuwa ("informative narration") {{goes back}} to <b>orally</b> transmitted myths, legends, folktales, and anecdotes. Setsuwa comprise the oldest Japanese tales, were originally Buddhist influenced, and {{were meant to be}} educational. The oldest setsuwa collection is the Nihon Ryōiki (early 9th century). With a widening religious and social interest of the aristocracy, setsuwa collections were compiled again in the late 11th century starting with the Konjaku Monogatarishū The high quality of the Tale of Genji influenced the literature into the 11th and 12th centuries. A large number of monogatari and some of the best poetic treatises were written in the early Kamakura period (around 1200).|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history <b>orally</b> and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the early}} Jurchens had no written records, {{the story of}} Hanpu was first {{transmitted}} <b>orally.</b> According to the History of Jin (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from Goryeo {{at the age of}} sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan. Other sources claim that Hanpu was from Silla, the state that had ruled the Korean peninsula but was annexed by Goryeo in 935. The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, his two brothers remained behind, one in Goryeo and one in the Balhae area. Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of Wanyan Wugunai (1021–1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the Jurchens still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him <b>orally.</b> Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Coming from an oral tradition, {{the written}} word was nonexistent until the missionary arrival. Kanak {{knowledge}} was passed <b>orally</b> {{in the form of}} poems, legends, and stories. Children's oral history is provided by parents and other relatives who also use tickling and onomatopoeic noise to hold the child's attention. Of the Kanak authors, some of the notable ones are Jean-Marie Tjibaou who wrote La Présence Kanak; Susanna Ounei-Small, a Kanak author from Ouvéa who wrote about the Matignon Accords; and Kaloombat Tein, author of Hwanfalik – Sayings from the Hienghene Valley which provides insight into Hienghène legends and is written in Hienghène, with English language translation.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them <b>orally</b> at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether <b>orally</b> or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|More than 200 Upanishads are known, {{of which}} the first dozen or so are {{the oldest and most}} {{important}} and are referred to as the principal or main (mukhya) Upanishads. The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down <b>orally.</b> The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of them in all likelihood pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected <b>orally</b> with the virus.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate <b>orally</b> for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus {{is highly}} {{contagious}} and cannot {{be treated with}} antibiotics or other drugs. Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, {{and the rate of}} hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. Two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection are approved for global use and are safe and effective in children: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. Both are taken <b>orally</b> and contain attenuated live virus. Three vaccines are licensed for use in national markets only: ROTAVAC®, licensed in India in 2014; Rotavin-M1™, licensed in Vietnam in 2007; and Lanzhou Lamb Rotavirus Vaccine, licensed in China in 2000. Additional rotavirus vaccines are under development.|$|E
