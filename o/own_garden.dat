5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his <b>own</b> <b>garden</b> and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's <b>own</b> <b>garden</b> at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E

25|$|John Gerard, also spelt John Gerarde, (c. 1545–1612) was a {{botanist}} and herbalist. He {{maintained a}} large herbal garden in London. His chief notability is {{as the author}} of a large (1,484 pages) illustrated Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes. First published in 1597, it was the most widely circulated botany book in English in the 17th century. Except for the additions of a number of plants from his <b>own</b> <b>garden</b> and from North America, Gerard's Herbal is largely an unacknowledged English translation of Rembert Dodoens's herbal originally published in 1554, itself also highly popular (in Dutch, Latin, French and other English translations).|$|E
25|$|The {{publisher}} John Norton, {{who was the}} Queen's Printer, approached Gerard {{regarding a}} possible English translation of Dodoens' popular herbal, Stirpium historiae pemptades sex (1583). This was a Latin version of an earlier work in Flemish by Dodoens, his Cruydeboeck (Herb Book 1554) which had already been translated into English by Henry Lyte, under the name A Niewe Herball in 1578 and had proved popular. Gerard was not Norton's first choice, the translation having originally been commissioned from Dr Robert Priest, {{a member of the}} London College of Physicians who had died untimely. Although Gerard acknowledges Priest's role, he implies that he died prior to commencing the work. As curator of the College garden, he would have been familiar with Priest, and his work. The completed book appears to incorporate much of Priest's work, together with his own completion of the text in the form of annotations from his <b>own</b> <b>garden</b> and for the first time, some North American plants. For instance, the first description of the potato in English appeared in this work, although he mistakenly believed it came from Virginia rather than South America (see illustration). He then incorporated as-yet-unpublished material from his friend, L'Obel and also Clusius and rearranged the work to more closely follow and utilise L'Obel's scheme from his 1570 Stirpium adversaria nova. It is thought this was to disguise the original source.|$|E

Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our <b>own</b> <b>garden.</b> They didn't have anything like that".|$|E
500|$|Parkinson died in {{the summer}} of 1650, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 6 August. He is commemorated in the Central American genus of leguminous trees Parkinsonia. Paradisi in Sole also {{inspired}} the children's writer Juliana Horatia Ewing (18411885) to write the story Mary's Meadow, which was first published from November 1883 to March 1884 in Aunt Judy's Magazine (18661885), produced by her mother Margaret Gatty. In the story, some children read Paradisi in Sole and are inspired to create their <b>own</b> <b>garden.</b> The magazine received much favourable correspondence about the story, and in July 1884 it was suggested that a Parkinson Society should be formed. The objects of the society were to [...] "search out and cultivate old garden flowers which have become scarce; to exchange seeds and plants; to plant waste places with hardy flowers; to circulate books on gardening amongst the Members... to try to prevent the extermination of rare wild flowers, as well as of garden treasures." ...|$|E
500|$|Her parents, nicknamed 'Ernie' and 'Ducky,' {{were first}} cousins who {{married at the}} {{instigation}} of their common grandmother, Queen Victoria. The marriage was an unhappy one from the start. Princess Victoria Melita was eighteen {{at the time of}} Elisabeth's birth. She was fond of Elisabeth, but found it hard to compete with Ernst's devotion to their daughter. Ernst was convinced even before Elisabeth could speak that he alone could understand her. At the age of six months, she was scheduled to move to a new nursery and her father 'consulted' her on her color preferences. He claimed that she made 'happy little squeals' when he showed her a particular shade of lilac material. Ernst then decorated her nursery in shades of lilac. He later had a playhouse built for his daughter that stood in its <b>own</b> <b>garden.</b> Adults were forbidden to enter [...] "much to the frustration of royal nurses and tutors, who could be seen pacing up and down impatiently outside as they waited for their high-spirited young charges to stop their games and emerge." ...|$|E

It was noted that in 1917 redcurrant harvest was so rich that renters could earn almost four times the yearly rent just by selling their fruits.|$|R
500|$|The Peterloo Massacre was {{the last}} {{political}} meeting Horsefield attended, although he retained a general {{interest in the subject}} of radical politics. He attended the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, supported the idea of self-education and, according to Harvey Taylor, a historian, [...] "typified the Lancashire autodidactic seeker after self-culture." [...] Having obtained his <b>own</b> <b>garden</b> in 1819, he promoted his interests by founding the Prestwich Botanical Society on 11 September 1820, presiding over meetings in a pub where plant specimens were brought together for identification and where those who could not read were taught the science of botany by those who could. He was president of the society for 32 years, during which time at least 131 books were purchased by the society for communal use. Writing in December 1829, Horsefield explained that the Prestwich Society met on the second Monday of each month and usually had between 12 and 20 members, who were charged a monthly 6d. (2½p) subscription. The subscription, which was common to such societies, was intended to pay for books and create a fund for the purchase of drink; the pub landlord provided the meeting and storage space at no charge as long as sufficient drink was consumed, a practice known as [...] "wet rent".|$|E
