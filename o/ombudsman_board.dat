5000|$|Like {{government}} run ombudsman services, {{the services}} of external/alternative dispute resolution (ADR) are sometimes free for consumers. The costs of the ombudsman services are usually charged to its members {{on a case by}} case basis, or can be determined on the amount of complaints that the company has received for that financial year. Generally the providers in a particular industry (for example telecommunications, energy and water, credit, insurance, public transport) are required to be members of an independent External Dispute Resolution scheme (EDR). A Board or Council with representatives of both industry and consumers as well as an independent Chair, is responsible for the operation of an industry-based <b>Ombudsman.</b> The <b>Board</b> or Council appoints the Ombudsman. Government or an independent regulator, such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) may be involved by approving the scheme and ensuring that it complies with certain standards. Sometimes a Government Ombudsman is also an industry Ombudsman. An industry-based Ombudsman typically charges each member according to the number and/or the complexity of complaints it receives about the company. While the development of these facilities over the last 20 years has [...] "lifted industry dispute resolution standards", the industry schemes have [...] "stalled and cannot be described as world best practice".|$|R

This is the most extensive survey of its kind and the first to explore the attitudes of young people towards the reformed policing structures. The report reveals that many young people have experience of verbal and physical harassment by police officers but have little depth of knowledge of the Police <b>Ombudsman,</b> the Policing <b>Board</b> or the District Policing Partnerships. It also indicates that while few young people would consider the police as a career, there was a broad level of support for the police as an institution. Many also felt that young people are rarely consulted on issues relating to policing and the views and experiences of young people need to be taken in to account more widely by all the agencies involved in policing and police accountability in Northern Ireland.

For example, the chapter called [...] "Executive" [...] (Vollziehung) covers both the executive and the judicial branches of government, whereas the Court of Audit, a comptrolling office supervising the administration, has a chapter all by itself. Another office that has a chapter to itself is the <b>Ombudsman</b> <b>Board,</b> a powerless bureau of public advocates that mainly serves as a sinecure for aging party loyalists.Wedged between the Court of Audit and the <b>Ombudsman</b> <b>Board</b> is a chapter of provisions regarding the administrative and constitutional courts that were omitted from the Executive chapter for reasons lost to time.|$|E
