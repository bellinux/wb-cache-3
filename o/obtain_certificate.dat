He studied Geography at the University of Ibadan and graduated in 1985. He did his National Youth Service Corps in Bauchi State, from where he moved to Kano State and taught in Gwarzo Secondary School, Gwarzo, and Rogo Secondary School, Rogo.

30|$|In general, when we {{distribute}} {{the task of}} one system to many subsystems, we may have availability and performance problems. So, some of the DCA schemes try to decrease these problems and use special infrastructures to provide better availability and performance. For example, Raghani et al. [20] have designed a DCA, in which networks nodes can <b>obtain</b> <b>certificate</b> from their one hop neighbors. With such distributed CA, {{when the number of}} neighbors of a node, also called node degree, reduces, there is a substantial increase in the certification service delays. Therefore, they have tried to solve this problem with a suite of network monitoring protocols. The proposed protocols dynamically adjust the threshold value by monitoring the average node degree of the network and thereby prevent an increase in certification service delay.|$|E
40|$|We study {{certificates}} in {{static data}} structures. In the cell-probe model, certificates are the cell probes which can uniquely identify {{the answer to}} the query. As a natural notion of nondeterministic cell probes, lower bounds for certificates in data structures immediately imply deterministic cell-probe lower bounds. In spite of this extra power brought by nondeterminism, we prove that two widely used tools for cell-probe lower bounds: richness lemma of Miltersen et al. and direct-sum richness lemma of Patrascu and Thorup, both hold for certificates in data structures with even better parameters. Applying these lemmas and adopting existing reductions, we <b>obtain</b> <b>certificate</b> lower bounds for a variety of static data structure problems. These certificate lower bounds are at least as good as the highest known cell-probe lower bounds for the respective problems. In particular, for approximate near neighbor (ANN) problem in Hamming distance, our lower bound improves the state of the art. When the space is strictly linear, our lower bound for ANN in d-dimensional Hamming space becomes t=Omega(d), which along with the recent breakthrough for polynomial evaluation of Larsen, are the only two t=Omega(d) lower bounds ever proved for any problems in the cell-probe model.

The aim of this working group is to prepare procedures for safe handling with cytostatic drugs, as well as program for educational seminar for nurses, medical technicians, and pharmaceutical technicians. The procedures {{will serve as a}} guide of good practice of oncology health care, and will refer to all actions that health care professionals carry out from the moment of drugs arrival to the pharmacy to the moment of their application. In the first segment of this procedure, general rules are given for working with cytotoxic agents, control for risky exposures, safe system of work, control of working environment, monitoring of the employees' health condition adequate protection in the working environment, protective equipment of the employees (gloves, mask, cap, eyeglasses, shoe covers, coats and chambers for vertical laminary air stream). Storing of cytostatics, procedure in case of accident, and waste handling and removal are also described in this segment. Fifty-three standard operational procedures are described in detail in the second segment. Training scheme for preparation of chemotherapy is given in the third segment - education related to various fields and practical part, which would be carried out through workshops, {{and at the end of}} the course participants would pass a test and <b>obtain</b> <b>certificate.</b> After the procedures for safe handling with cytostatics are legally regulated employer will have to provide minimum of protective equipment, special rooms for the drugs dissolving, chambers with laminar airflow, 6 hours working time, rotation of the staff working with drugs dissolving in intervals of every five years, higher efficiency, better health control. In conclusion this specific field of work requires great psychological and physical efforts, and know-how. When taking care of ourselves, we are taking care of the others, as well...|$|E

40|$|Commencing 2014, the Malaysian Government has {{introduced}} a new school based assessment system (PT 3) for Form Three students. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the determinants of private tutoring (PT) among Form Three students and to determine whether changes in the assessment system affects the demand and dimension of private tutoring. Additionally, this study uses advanced econometric analysis to identify whether private tutoring helps to improve the performance of Form Three students. The study also examines reasons for students’ participation in private tutoring for non-examination subjects (History and Geography). This research applied both quantitative and qualitative methodology. Stratified sampling was used to select students of different academic ability from ten schools in five zones in Malaysia. One school is chosen respectively from urban and rural area of each zone. Questionnaires were self-distributed to six hundred and sixty nine students. Interview was also conducted with one student from each school in the five zones. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. Findings of the study suggested that ethnicity, quality of school and the types of tuition provider were important determinants for students’ participation in private tutoring for examination and non-examination subjects. The results showed that location was a significant factor that determined students’ participation in private tutoring for non-examination subjects but it was not a significant factor for examination subjects. Findings also revealed that participation in private tutoring was an important factor that determines the greater number of A’s that students obtain in PT 3 assessment. Ordered logistic regression showed that an increase in Malay ethnicity increased the log odds by 2. 56 for obtaining a higher number of A’s compared to Indian students, holding else constant. The qualitative result also suggested that students’ participation in private tutoring for History was to enhance their understanding and as preparation for Form Five (SPM) examinations since History is a compulsory subject to pass to <b>obtain</b> <b>certificate</b> in SPM. The findings provide insights to policy makers in both developing and developed countries whether the demand for private tutoring is affected when the assessment method changes...|$|E

The food products approved by TBS and TFDA attract more customers increasing sale’s volume and profit. However, most of the women entrepreneurs fail to meet basic requirements to <b>obtain</b> <b>certificates</b> of standards. During the focus group discussions, several respondents mentioned that {{it is very difficult to}} <b>obtain</b> <b>certificates</b> from TBS and TFDA due to lengthy procedures. They expressed that “we have to observe a lot of conditions and most of us we are processing food products at home premises”. Our findings are in line with those of Panda (2018) who observed complications with regulations, complex requirements to register, bureaucracy, and favouritism as impediments to the development of women entrepreneurship in developing countries. As food processing demands special premises in order to avoid contaminations and maintain proper hygiene for human consumption, our study recommends that business incubators should set up new sites to accommodate {{a large number of}} clients and eliminate the lack of working premises.|$|R
