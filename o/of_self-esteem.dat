In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and William Darity, Jr., an economist, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, conducted an 18-month study at 11 North Carolina schools. The {{study concluded that}} white and black students have essentially the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels <b>of</b> <b>self-esteem</b> when they do better in school. They compared attitudes identified as acting white to the normal adolescent pains experienced in John Hughes' movies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect <b>of</b> <b>self-esteem</b> spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

The two forms of organizational uncertainty perception were job insecurity and anticipation of organizational changes, and the three outcomes were intrinsic motivation, organizational commitment, and absenteeism. Results supported the moderating effects <b>of</b> organization-based <b>self-esteem.</b> It was found that employees with high levels <b>of</b> organization-based <b>self-esteem</b> were less responsive to the perception of organizational uncertainty.

5000|$|Implicit {{self-esteem}} In {{the article}} [...] "Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind {{men and the}} elephant revisited?", the validity and reliability <b>of</b> seven implicit <b>self-esteem</b> measures have been explored. The implicit measures {{were not correlated with}} one another. However they did correlate, but only faintly with measures <b>of</b> explicit <b>self-esteem.</b> The implicit self-esteem measurements confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities. Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that measurements <b>of</b> implicit <b>self-esteem</b> are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research <b>of</b> implicit <b>self-esteem.</b>|$|R

Affiliative humor is also associated with increased levels <b>of</b> (explicit) <b>self-esteem,</b> psychological well-being, emotional stability, and social intimacy.

Larimer did a study to investigate gender differences in body image concerns, and the influence <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem</b> on body dissatisfaction. The results proved that female college students focused more on weight/body shape, while male students focused on muscularity. When the association <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem</b> and weight/body shape was examined, evidence proved higher levels <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem</b> is more strongly associated with greater concern regarding weight/body shape in females in comparison to males. In contrast, when the association <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem</b> and muscularity was examined, evidence proved higher levels <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem</b> is associated more with greater concern regarding muscle gain in males in comparison to females.|$|R

40|$|Professional {{self-esteem}} {{is a very}} important concept that should be highlighted to the professionals because it makes them understand their worthiness, evaluate their expertise and adjust themselves accordingly with their ambience. As far as the teachers are concerned, it becomes more imperative for them to persistently evaluate their competencies in order to perform their model role in their best. This continuous perusal of their professional abilities is the essence <b>of</b> professional <b>self-esteem</b> as it would, undoubtedly, enable them to explore those qualities which are complementary to the vitality of their role as a teacher. The perception <b>of</b> professional <b>self-esteem</b> is very important as it advocates the very essence of professionalism amongst the professionals. This research is mainly focused on professional <b>self-esteem</b> <b>of</b> teachers at secondary level. The major objective of this research is to compare the level <b>of</b> professional <b>self-esteem</b> <b>of</b> teachers (science/arts, rural/urban, male/female) at secondary level. Aricak (1999) Professional Self-Esteem Scale was used for this research study. Simple random sampling technique was used to get sample from the population. Data was collected from secondary school teachers of Sahiwal District, who were teaching different subjects of Science and Arts. The response rate was 81 % as 203 out of 250 questionnaires were returned. Independent Sample t-test was applied.

25|$|Implicit {{self-esteem}} {{refers to}} a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.

25|$|The {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>self-esteem</b> as {{a distinct}} psychological construct {{is thought to have}} its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, William James (1892). James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the 'I-self') and the resulting knowledge about the self (the 'Me-self'). Observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self create three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James. These are the material self, social self, and spiritual self. The social self comes closest to self-esteem, comprising all characteristics recognized by others. The material self consists of representations of the body and possessions, and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self. This view <b>of</b> <b>self-esteem</b> as the collection of an individual's attitudes toward oneself remains today.|$|E

5000|$|Research on RCSE {{has only}} been {{conducted}} in American samples. In collectivist cultures, life satisfaction is often a result of living {{in harmony with the}} community and within one’s relationships with others rather than the attainment <b>of</b> high <b>self-esteem.</b> [...] Therefore, it is unclear whether there is a difference in prevalence of RCSE among different nations and cultures. Some researchers believe that the pursuit <b>of</b> a <b>self-esteem,</b> which is a hallmark consequence of all types <b>of</b> contingent <b>self-esteem,</b> is a fundamentally American phenomenon. The Protestant Ethic and ideas of self-reliance and meritocracy may lead Americans to believe that self-worth must be earned by performance and attainment, and that some people are worthier than others.|$|R

25|$|How {{individuals}} {{view themselves}} ultimately determines who they are, their abilities {{and what they}} can be.

Poor self-esteem whether it be too high or too low can result in aggression, violence, self-deprecating behavior, anxiety, and other mental disorders.|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{measuring}} the perceived Professional Self-esteem, Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Personal Accomplishment (PA) of Iranian (n = 230) and Turkish (n = 156) EFL teachers and determining the prediction role <b>of</b> Professional <b>Self-esteem</b> in EE, DP, and PA processes. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey (MBI-ES) {{was used to}} measure the perceived burnout levels of the participants, and a shortened English version <b>of</b> Professional <b>Self-esteem</b> Scale developed by Aricak (1999) was employed to measure the participants’ self-esteem perceptions in five dimensions of satisfaction, knowledge development, commitment, adaptation and communication. The internal reliability <b>of</b> the professional <b>self-esteem</b> scale was r = 0. 821. The results revealed that professional selfesteem was strongly correlated with EE, DP, and PA burnout. They also showed that EE, DP, and PA processes were better predicted by Satisfaction, Commitment, and Knowledge Development dimensions <b>of</b> Professional <b>Self-esteem</b> in the case of both Iranian and Turkish teachers, respectively. Moreover, the EE and PA prediction variances of Iranian group were greater than that of Turkish group, whereas the DP prediction variance of Turkish group was greater than that of Iranian group.

Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field.

25|$|Implicit {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{began to}} be used in the 1980s. These rely on indirect measures of cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem, including the Name Letter Task. Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli. For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} <b>self-esteem</b> <b>of</b> {{adolescents}} suffering from {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) with that of healthy adolescents, and to identify factors affecting self-esteem {{in the presence of}} IBD. METHODS: A self-assessment questionnaire, 'I think I am' (ITIA), was completed by 71 (41 boys) out of 77 adolescents (10 - 16 years) with IBD. Of the participating adolescents, 23 had Crohn's disease, 44 had ulcerative colitis and 4 had indeterminate colitis. The <b>self-esteem</b> <b>of</b> adolescents with IBD was compared with that of 1037 school children. RESULTS: In this population-based study, children with IBD estimated their self-esteem in the same range as healthy adolescents. Using a multiple regression analysis, the <b>self-esteem</b> <b>of</b> adolescents with IBD was related to disease course severity and cohabitation status of parents. Children with severe disease and children of single parents were found to be most at risk <b>of</b> low <b>self-esteem.</b> CONCLUSION: This study shows that, as a group, adolescents with IBD have self-esteem in the same range as their healthy peers, but that there are some adolescents with IBD who are at risk <b>of</b> low <b>self-esteem.</b> Special attention should be given to adolescents with a severe disease course and to those with separated parents...|$|R
