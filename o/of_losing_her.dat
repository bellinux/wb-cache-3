5|$|In 1896, Ferdinand and Marie {{moved to}} Cotroceni Palace, {{which had been}} {{extended}} by the Romanian architect Grigore Cerchez, and to which Marie added her own designs. The following year, Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever. For days, he was delirious and, despite his doctor's best efforts, came close to dying. During this time, Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and was terrified at the prospect <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>her</b> husband. King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol, whose young age presented issues; thus, the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to pull through. Eventually, he did, and he and Marie went to Sinaia, the site of Peleș Castle, {{for a period of}} recovery. Nonetheless, the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee that summer. During Ferdinand's convalescence, Marie spent most of her time with her two children, taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them. The winter of 1897/1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera, where Marie often rode horses, in spite of the low temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between national and personal traumas {{is a key}} concern in two Dominican-American short-story cycles, Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents (1991) and Junot Díaz’s This is How You <b>Lose</b> <b>Her</b> (2012). Both texts link the inability to establish long-lasting romantic relationships to the violent collective past of the Dominican Republic, but they do so very differently. With its regressive chronological structure, Alvarez’s narrative casts its characters as inescapable victims of a history destined to repeat itself. By contrast, Díaz eschews Alvarez’s etiological quest, highlighting the question of personal responsibility. Only marginally successful in rejecting traditional models of national identity, the protagonist-narrator <b>of</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>Her</b> continues the reconceptualization of Dominicanness begun in Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) ...|$|R

Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him.

500|$|The protagonists of {{his films}} often deal with {{excessive}} drug, smoke or alcohol consumption, personal guilt, extreme rage and arrogance which leads them into self-shattering situations.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive.

[...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris heavily criticized the episode as [...] "a retread of 'Irresistible'".

That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's {{first day on the}} set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
