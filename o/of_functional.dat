5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> graphs {{is in the}} trains used to study Steiner triple systems. The train of a triple system is a functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr is mapped by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively. Trains {{have been shown to}} be a powerful invariant of triple systems although somewhat cumbersome to compute.|$|E

Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate.

These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying {{the role of}} prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities.

5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed.

By the mid-1930s, they were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles, and Idahos guns were removed to coastal fortifications. Both were sunk by German aircraft in 1941, and raised in the 1950s to be sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
