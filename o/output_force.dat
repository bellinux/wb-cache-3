25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull {{at an angle}}. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's <b>output</b> <b>force</b> but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Linear {{machines}} are widely employed in robotics, transportation and manufacturing industries because complex rotation-to-translation conversion mechanism {{is no longer}} required. This paper proposed a novel tubular linear machine with dual permanent magnet (PM) Halbach arrays to achieve high <b>force</b> <b>output</b> performance. Based on Lorentz force law, the magnetic <b>force</b> <b>output</b> and <b>force</b> ripple for three-phase winding linear machine is formulated in analytical way.

In addition, based on the technology of non-dimensionalization, the mathematical force models are employed to analyze the influence among the structure parameters on the <b>force</b> <b>output</b> and <b>force</b> ripple for design purpose of the tubular linear machines. The study in this paper could contribute to the design analysis and optimization of electromagnetic linear machines with similar poles patterns...|$|R

40|$|Biorobotic {{research}} {{seeks to}} develop new robotic technologies modeled after the performance of human and animal neuromuscular systems. The development of one component of a biorobotic system, an artificial muscle and tendon, is reported here. The device is based on known static and dynamic properties of biological muscle and tendon that were extracted from the literature and used to mathematically describe their force, length, and velocity relationships. A flexible pneumatic actuator is proposed as the contractile element of the artificial muscle and experimental results are presented that show the force-length properties of the actuator are muscle-like, but the force-velocity properties are not. The addition of a hydraulic damper is proposed to improve the actuator s velocity-dependent properties. Further, an artificial tendon is proposed whose function is to serve as connective tissue between the artificial muscle and a skeletal structure. A complete model of the artificial muscle- tendon system is then presented which predicts the expected force-length-velocity performance of the artificial system. Experimental results of the constructed device indicate muscle-like performance in general: higher activation pressures yielded higher <b>output</b> <b>forces,</b> faster concentric contractions resulted in lower <b>force</b> <b>outputs,</b> faster eccentric contractions produced higher <b>force</b> <b>outputs,</b> and <b>output</b> <b>forces</b> were higher at longer muscle lengths than shorter lengths...|$|R

Among pressure driven actuators, fluid elastic actuators demonstrate high potential {{for use in the}} medical field. They are characterized by nearly no friction and wear and they can be made of low-cost biocompatible elastomers. However, when compared to traditional piston-cylinder fluid actuators, fluid elastic actuators often result in smaller <b>output</b> <b>forces</b> as well as weaker return forces.
