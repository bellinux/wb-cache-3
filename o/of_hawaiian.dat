5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War {{and the history of}} Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcano formation, Kīlauea {{started as a}} {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea {{with a series of}} explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcano formation, Mauna Loa would have {{started as a}} {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from the sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843. Although Mauna Loa's activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor Kīlauea, it remains active.|$|E

In response to a colonial history that has consistently Othered and devalued Native Hawaiian identity, contemporary Native Hawaiian writers are constructing a new Native Hawaiian identity to be reborn in literature.

This thesis problematizes constructions <b>of</b> Native <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>of</b> Native <b>Hawaiian</b> identity in selected autoethnographic literature <b>of</b> the <b>Hawaiian</b> Renaissance, with regard to their investment in a language of authenticity and essentialism. Methodology includes analyzing Native Hawaiian literature to examine the ways in which Native Hawaiians’ own ambiguity as multiracial and multicultural colonial subjects are uncontainable by the language of authenticity they employ to construct Native Hawaiian identity...|$|R
40|$|Let us {{begin by}} pondering {{what it meant}} to be a <b>Hawaiian</b> Prince <b>of</b> 20 th Century Hawai‘i. Prince Jonah Kühiö Kalaniana‘ole was genealogical heir to the mana (spiritual power) of deified high chiefs, the human {{embodiment}} <b>of</b> ancestral <b>Hawaiian</b> gods <b>of</b> the universe. At the dawn of the 20 th Century, Prince Kühiö faced the urgency and despair of his people on the brink of extinction. From 1900 to 1920 the number <b>of</b> pure <b>Hawaiians</b> had declined from 29, 799 to 23, 700. The life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> was only 30. 2 years in 1910, and had increased to only 35 years by 1920. In 1925, the infant mortality rate was 136 per 1, 000 live births, compared to only 39 per 1, 000 for Caucasians. These years also witnessed the growing urban ghettoization <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiians,</b> disenfranchised from their lands. The number <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> living in Honolulu increased to 17, 500 in 1920, where they faced increasing competition from the 13, 400 Chinese and 24, 500 Japanese who lived in the city. 1 They lived in crowded tenement rooms, sharing a common kitchen, bath, and toilet facilities where viruses and diseases spread rapidly. In 1911 cholera claimed Hawaiian lives, and by 1918 tuberculosis spread throughout Honolulu. Prince Kühiö described the problems <b>of</b> poor <b>Hawaiian</b> families in the Honolulu tenements as follows: We find that the people who live in the tenement houses in this city are nearly all Hawaiians [...] These Hawaiian families living in the tenements are poor, they do not own an inch of land in their own country. ...|$|R

5|$|Country {{music is}} {{primarily}} a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country, then known as hillbilly music. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country. The earliest country instrumentation revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added. String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> musical groups in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning {{and others}} {{began the process}} of {{creating}} a historical documentary film about the individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, including Pitman, Samuel C. Armstrong, Nathaniel Bright Emerson, James Wood Bush, J. R. Kealoha and many other unnamed combatants of both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2014, Maui-based author Wayne Moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on the lives and Civil War service <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> soldiers like Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman in his book Pukoko: A Hawaiian in the American Civil War. In 2015, the sesquicentennial {{of the end of the}} war, the National Park Service released a publication titled Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaiʻi's involvement and the biographies of Pitman, Bush, Kealoha and others were co-written by historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> annexation. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, the new {{government}} of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.|$|E

5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are {{a few examples of}} diversity in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most heavily eroded part of the chain are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85million years in age. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains are {{separated}} by a large L-shaped bend that causes the orientations of the chains to differ by about 60°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change {{in the direction of}} plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue is still currently under debate. All of the volcanoes {{in this part of the}} chain have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots (see also the seamount and guyot stages <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcanism). Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The seamount chain extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.|$|E

5|$|The retreat was {{completed}} in 1845 and became a place for entertaining foreign celebrities, chiefs, and commoners. On Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day (Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea) in 1847, King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama hosted a grand luau at the palace. The celebration commemorated the fourth anniversary of the restoration <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> independence and sovereignty by British Rear-Admiral Richard Darton Thomas, following a five-month British occupation of the kingdom during the Paulet Affair of 1843. The luau was attended by an estimated ten thousand guests. The palace {{may also have been}} the site of an earlier luau, or great ahaʻaina (feast), which was part of the initial ten-day restoration festivities in 1842. Children from the Royal School, including all of the future Hawaiian monarchs, often visited with their teachers (the Cookes).|$|E
5|$|When Cleveland {{took office}} {{he faced the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with Hawai'i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor. In the intervening four years, Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In early 1893 they overthrew her, set up a republican government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States. The Harrison administration had quickly agreed {{with representatives of the}} new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval. Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai'i to investigate the conditions there.|$|E
5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E
