50|$|In the method, an <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primer</b> hybridizes to a {{complementary}} region along the nucleic acid, {{to form a}} duplex, with the primer’s terminal 3’ end directly adjacent to the nucleotide base to be identified. The <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primer</b> is enzymatically extended by a single base {{in the presence of}} all four nucleotide terminators; the nucleotide terminator complementary to the base in the template being interrogated is incorporated and identified. The presence of all four terminators ensures that no further extension occurs beyond the single incorporated base. Many approaches can be taken for determining the identity of a terminator, including fluorescence labeling, mass labeling for mass spectrometry, measuring enzyme activity using a protein moiety, and isotope labeling.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the growing}} demand for <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> to {{initiate}} DNA replication and for probes, a plan was put into place to develop a core facility to produce reagents for molecular biologists as well as instrumentation {{for the analysis of}} DNA and protein samples.

50|$|Gustducin was {{discovered}} in 1992 when degenerate <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> were synthesized and mixed with a taste tissue cDNA library. The DNA products were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method, and eight positive clones were shown to encode the α subunits of G-proteins, (which interact with G-protein-coupled receptors).

This rapid RT-PCR technique has now been applied to the analysis of expression of a multigene family allowing the expression of individual gene members to be detected and compared following a single RT-PCR reaction.

50|$|Inter-Retrotransposons Amplified Polymorphisms (IRAPs) are {{alternative}} retrotransposon-based markers. In this method, PCR <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> face outwards from terminal retrotransposon regions. Thus, they {{amplify the}} fragment between two retrotransposon insertions. As retrotransposon integration patterns vary between genotypes, {{the number and}} size of the resulting amplicons can be used for differentiation of genotypes or cultivars, to measure genetic diversity or to reconstruct phylogenies. SINEs, which are small in size and often integrate within or next to genes represent an optimal source for the generation of effective IRAP markers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing a {{synthetic}} <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primer</b> complementary to human prostate-specific antigen mRNA, {{we found that}} an additional sequence possibly similar to human glandular kallikrein- 1 could be read by a primer-extension sequencing technique.

Northern blot analysis with 2 oligonucleotide probes respectively specific for prostate-specific antigen and human glandular kallikrein- 1 mRNAs showed that the length of both mRNAs was similar at 1. 5 kb. The level of human glandular kallikrein- 1 mRNA relative to that of prostate-specific antigen could be estimated as approx. 10 – 20 %. This study constitutes the first evidence that the human glandular kallikrein- 1 gene is expressed {{at a high level}} in a human tissue...|$|R
50|$|Many {{biological}} and forensic cases involving genetic analysis require sequencing of DNA from minute amounts of sample, such as DNA from uncultured single cells or trace amounts of tissue collected from crime scenes. Conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based DNA amplification methods require sequence-specific <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> and heat-stable (usually Taq) polymerase, {{and can be}} used to generate significant amounts of DNA from minute amounts of DNA. However, this is not sufficient for modern techniques which use sequencing-based DNA analysis. Therefore, a more efficient non-sequence-specific method to amplify minute amounts of DNA is necessary, especially in single cell genomic studies.|$|E
50|$|Variable {{number of}} tandem repeat locus (VNTR locus) is any DNA {{sequence}} {{that exist in}} multiple copies strung together {{in a variety of}} tandem lengths. The number of repeat copies present at a locus can be visualized by means of a Multi-locus or Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis (MLVA). In short, <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> are developed for each specific tandem repeat locus, followed by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. When the length of the repeat {{and the size of the}} flanking regions is known, the number of repeats can be calculated. Analysis of multiple loci will result in a genotype.|$|E
50|$|By using <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> {{targeted}} to conserved {{regions in the}} 16S and 23S genes, RISA fragments can be generated {{from most of the}} dominant bacteria in an environmental sample. While the majority of the rRNA operon serves a structural function, portions of the 16S-23S intergenic region can encode tRNAs depending on the bacterial species. However the taxonomic value of the ISR lies in the significant heterogeneity in both length and nucleotide sequence. In RISA, we attempt to exploit the length heterogeneity of the ISR, which has been shown to range between 150 and 1500 bp with the majority of the ISR lengths being between 150 and 500 bp.|$|E

50|$|ARISA {{can have}} a higher {{resolution}} in detecting microbial diversity as compared to T-RFLP. This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities {{can be compared to}} databases for overlap with culturable organisms. One can design phylum-level <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups. One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} harmful seed and soil borne pathogens, Macrophomina phaseolina is a fungus that infects nearly 500 plant species in more than 100 families. The hosts include: peanut, cabbage, pepper, chickpea, soybean, sunflower, sweet potato, alfalfa, sesame, potato, sorghum, wheat, and corn, among others. The {{identification}} of isolates of M. phaseolina is usually based on mophology and efforts to divide the pathogen into subspecies, but because there are wide intraspecific variations in the phenotype of the isolates, these criteria are often not reliable. The failure to correctly detect and identify M. phaseolina using conventional culture-based morphological techniques has led scientists to develop nucleic acid-based molecular approaches, such as highly sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction-based methods. Researchers have also recently created species-specific <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> and digoxigenin-labeled probes in hopes of better identifying and detecting M. phaseolina.|$|E
50|$|The RPA process employs three core enzymes - a recombinase, a {{single-stranded}} DNA-binding protein (SSB) and strand-displacing polymerase. Recombinases {{are capable}} of pairing <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> with homologous sequence in duplex DNA. SSB bind to displaced strands of DNA and prevent the primers from being displaced. Finally, the strand displacing polymerase begins DNA synthesis where the primer has bound to the target DNA. By using two opposing primers, much like PCR, if the target sequence is indeed present, an exponential DNA amplification reaction is initiated. There is no other sample manipulation such as thermal or chemical melting is required to initiate amplification. At optimal temperatures (37-42 °C), the reaction progresses rapidly and results in specific DNA amplification from just a few target copies to detectable levels, typically within 10 minutes, for rapid detection of viral genomic DNA or RNA, pathogenic bacterial genomic DNA, as well as short length aptamer DNA.|$|E

50|$|Recombinant {{antibodies}} are monoclonal antibodies {{generated in}} vitro using synthetic genes. Recombinant antibody technology involves recovering the antibody genes {{from the source}} cells, amplifying and cloning the genes into an appropriate vector, introducing the vector into a host, and achieving expression of adequate amounts of functional antibody. Recombinant antibodies can be cloned from any species of antibody-producing animal, if the appropriate <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers</b> or hybridization probes are available. The ability to manipulate the antibody genes {{makes it possible to}} generate new antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments and scFv in vitro. This can be done {{at the level of the}} whole combining site by making new combinations of H and L chains. It can also be done by mutating individual CDRs. Display libraries, commonly expressed in phage or yeast, can be analysed to select for desirable characteristics arising from such changes in antibody sequence.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} widely used for the {{detection}} of single base mutations, as in genetic diseases. [...] LCR and PCR may be used to detect gonorrhea and chlamydia, and may be performed on first-catch urine samples, providing easy collection and a large yield of organisms. Endogenous inhibitors limit the sensitivity, but if this effect could be eliminated, LCR and PCR would have clinical advantages over any other methods of diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia.Among these methods, LCR is emerging as the most sensitive method with high specificity for known SNP detection (20). LCR was first developed by Barany, who used thermostable DNA ligase to discriminate between normal and mutant DNA and to amplify the allele-specific product. A mismatch at the 3′ end of the discriminating primer prevents the DNA ligase from joining the two fragments together. By using both strands of genomic DNA as targets for oligonucleotide hybridization, the products generated from two sets of adjacent <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>primers,</b> complementary to each target strand in one round of ligation, can become the targets for the next round. The amount of the products can thus be increased exponentially by repeated thermal cycling.|$|E

40|$|A novel, sequence-independent {{strategy}} has been developed for the amplification of full-length cDNA copies of the genes of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. Using human (Bristol) group C rotavirus as an example, a single amino-linked modified <b>oligonucleotide</b> (<b>primer</b> 1) was ligated to either end of each dsRNA genome segment by using T 4 RNA ligase. Following reverse transcription, annealing, and repair of cDNA strands, amplification of the viral dsRNA genome was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using a single complementary <b>oligonucleotide</b> (<b>primer</b> 2). Northern (RNA) hybridization of cDNA to virus dsRNA indicated {{that it was possible}} to generate cDNA representing the complete genome from very small clinical samples. This technique was used to determine the complete nucleotide sequence (728 bp) and coding assignment of gene 10, which revealed an open reading frame of 212 amino acids with limited homology to NS 26 from human group A rotavirus. In contrast to previous tailing methods, the addition of one defined primer allowed unequivocal identification of terminal nucleotides and should be generally applicable to viruses with segmented dsRNA genomes and especially for analysis of clinical samples, for which very limited quantities of biological material are available...|$|R
