40|$|Exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> is {{associated}} with increased respiratory morbidity and mortality in agricultural workers. <b>Organic</b> <b>dusts</b> in dairy farm environments are complex, polydisperse mixtures of toxic and immunogenic compounds. Previous toxicological studies focused primarily on exposures to the respirable size fraction; however, <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> in dairy farm environments are known to contain larger particles. Given the size distribution of dusts from dairy farm environments, the nasal and bronchial epithelia represent targets of agricultural dust exposures. In this study, well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells and human nasal epithelial cells were exposed to two different size fractions (PM 10 and PM> 10) of dairy parlor dust using a novel aerosol-to-cell exposure system. Levels of proinflammatory transcripts (interleukin [IL]- 8, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- 1) were measured 2 h after exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was also measured {{as an indicator of}} cytotoxicity. Cell exposure to dust was measured in each size fraction as a function of mass, endotoxin, and muramic acid levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of distinct size fractions of agricultural dust on human airway epithelial cells. Our results suggest that both PM 10 and PM> 10 size fractions elicit a proinflammatory response in airway epithelial cells and that the entire inhalable size fraction needs to be considered when assessing potential risks from exposure to agricultural dusts. Further, data suggest that human bronchial cells respond differently to these dusts than human nasal cells, and therefore that the two cell types need to be considered separately in airway cell models of agricultural dust toxicity.

Since bioaerosols are potentially related to various human health effects and the indoor environment provides a unique exposure situation, concerns about indoor bioaerosols have increased over the last decade.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Dairy working {{increases}} {{the prevalence of}} lower airway respiratory diseases, especially COPD and asthma. Epidemiological studies have reported that chronic inhalation of <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> released during specific daily tasks could represent a major risk factor for development of these pathologies in dairy workers. Knowledge on size, nature and biological activity of such <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> remain however limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare size distribution, microbial composition and cellular effects of dusts liberated by the spreading of straw bedding in five French dairy farms located in Brittany. RESULTS: Mechanized distribution of straw bedding generated a cloud of inhalable dusts in the five dairy farms' barns. Thoracic particles having a 3 - 7. 5 µm size constituted 58. 9 - 68. 3 % of these dusts. Analyses of thoracic dusts by next generation sequencing showed that the microbial dust composition differed between the five French farms, although Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria represent more than 97. 5 % of the bacterial phyla detected in each sample. Several bacteria genera comprising of human pathogenic species, such as Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Thermoactinomyces or Saccharopolyspora were identified. Cladosporium and Alternaria fungal genera, which are potent environmental determinants of respiratory symptoms, were detected in dusts collected in the five farms and their levels reached 15. 5 - 51. 1 % and 9 - 24. 7 % of assignable fungal sequences in each sample, respectively. Finally, all dust samples significantly and strongly increased {{the expression of the}} pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8 cytokines at both mRNA and protein levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Their effects were dose-dependent and detectable from 1 µg/ml. The intensity of the macrophage responses however differed according to the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strengthen the hypothesis that <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> released during the distribution of straw bedding are mainly constituted of thoracic particles which are small enough to deposit on lower bronchial epithelium of dairy farmers and induce inflammation...|$|R

In vitro tests using relevant cell cultures can be very useful for characterizing the toxicity of complex mixtures present in the air of occupational environments such as <b>organic</b> <b>dust.</b> In this study, the cell viability and the inflammatory response, as measured by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), were determined in human macrophages derived from THP- 1 monocytic cells. These cells were exposed to air samples from five occupational settings known to possess high levels of contamination of organic dust: poultry and swine feed industries, waste sorting, poultry production and slaughterhouses. Additionally, fungi and particle contamination of those settings was studied to better characterize the <b>organic</b> <b>dust</b> composition.

Mechanisms underlying this modulated response are not clear. Objective This study investigated the effects of repeat versus single <b>organic</b> <b>dust</b> exposure 9 ̆ 6 induced inflammatory mediators and protein kinase C (PKC) activity in monocytes. Methods Settled <b>organic</b> <b>dust</b> was obtained from swine confinement facilities. Promonocytic THP- 1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes were pretreated with or without dust extract and then restimulated. Culture supernatants were evaluated for TNF-a, IL- 6, CXCL 8, and IL- 10. Responses were compared with endotoxin-depleted dust, LPS, and peptidoglycan. PKC isoform (a, d,, ?) activation was evaluated by direct kinase activity. PKC isoform inhibitors' effects on TNF-a secretion were studied. Results Single exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>dust</b> stimulated monocyte secretion of TNF-a, IL- 6, CXCL 8, and IL- 10 compared with unstimulated cells. TNF-a and IL- 6 were diminished in pretreated cells restimulated with dust. Secretion of CXCL 8 and IL- 10 remained persistently elevated. TNF-a responses were retained after marked depletion of endotoxin. Dust exposure induced significant PKC a, d,, and ? activation, peaking at 30 to 60 minutes. PKC isoform activation was attenuated in repeat exposed cells. Inhibition of PKCa and PKC reduced dust-induced TNF-a secretion. Conclusion Repeat <b>organic</b> <b>dust</b> exposure modulated inflammatory mediator production in monocytes independent of endotoxin. The inability of PKC to be reactivated may account for this observation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of two <b>organic</b> <b>dusts,</b> wool and grain, and their soluble leachates to stimulate secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by rat alveolar macrophages with special reference to the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Rat alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and treated in vitro with whole dust, dust leachates, and a standard LPS preparation. TNF production was measured in supernatants with the L 929 cell line bioassay. RESULTS: Both wool and grain dust samples were capable of stimulating TNF release from rat alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. The standard LPS preparation caused a dose-dependent secretion of TNF. Leachates prepared from the dusts contained LPS and also caused TNF release but leachable LPS could not account for the TNF release and it was clear that non-LPS leachable activity was present in the grain dust and that wool dust particles themselves were capable of causing release of TNF. The role of LPS in wool dust leachates was further investigated by treating peritoneal macrophages from two strains of mice, LPS responders (C 3 H) and LPS non-responders (C 3 H/HEJ), with LPS. The non-responder mouse macrophages produced very low concentrations of TNF in response to the wool dust leachates compared with the responders. CONCLUSIONS: LPS and other unidentified leachable substances present on the surface of grain dust, and to a lesser extent on wool dust, are a trigger for TNF release by lung macrophages. Wool dust particles themselves stimulate TNF. TNF release from macrophages could contribute to enhancement of inflammatory responses and symptoms of bronchitis and breathlessness in workers exposed to <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> such as wool and grain...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{endotoxin}} {{has been}} suggested as responsible {{for the development of}} subjective symptoms and transient or chronic lung function impairment seen after exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>dusts</b> in cotton mills, poultry houses, swine confinement buildings and saw mills. Animal experiments have demonstrated bronchoalveolar neutrophilia being the most prominent cell response in animals following bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation. The present study was conducted to obtain information on some aspects of the early inflammatory response to inhaled LPS in man. Eight healthy nonsmoking subjects, 23 - 27 yrs old, underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 3 h after a provocation test with 100 micrograms LPS from E. coli dissolved in 2 ml isotonic NaCl. The solution was aerosolized with a jet nebulizer and inhaled. The calculated dose delivered to the lung was approximately 25 micrograms, which equals exposure in some occupational settings. The BAL data for each individual subject were compared with data from a control BAL performed at least 6 weeks prior to the LPS challenge. The major cellular response to LPS, reflected in BAL fluid, was an approximately hundredfold increase in neutrophils. The total number of lymphocytes was on average tripled. The alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized yeast particles in vitro was significantly reduced. A further indicator of an ongoing inflammation was an increase in fibronectin. No changes were seen in the levels of BAL albumin, indicating that the elevated level of fibronectin could not be explained by an increased permeability, but rather by a local production.

Methods: The SYNERGY project has pooled information on lifetime working and smoking from 13 300 lung cancer cases and 16 273 controls from 11 case - control studies conducted in Europe and Canada. A newly developed general population job-exposure matrix (assigning no, low or high exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>dust,</b> endotoxin, and contact with animals or fresh animal products) was applied to determine level of exposure.
