5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, but to no avail. As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the policy}} of the Christian {{authorities}} was generally to block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, and even then with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre and Teresa near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Mojácar while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, except what could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E

25|$|Before Cincinnati's incline {{system was}} built in the 1870s, which allowed {{development}} of residential areas on the hills, the city's population density was 32,000 people per square mile.

25|$|The UK uses a {{cumulative}} points system for driving offences. Points are deducted for driving offences by law courts, and the licence is endorsed accordingly. A UK driving licence may be {{endorsed by the}} courts for various offences, not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> committed while driving or {{in charge of a}} vehicle. These are usually recorded by changing the second digit of the endorsement code (usually to 2, 4, 6 or 9).

25|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, {{the upper part}} of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia. It is recommended <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who do not improve with PPIs. Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits over surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors. When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery, and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.|$|E

This ritual was performed in front of the community and contained many symbolic references; for example, the use of the sword was believed to make the child a warrior.|$|E
