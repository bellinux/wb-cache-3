It was built with cut stones worked in with much care and without cement. The southern facade was pierced with thesedoors. Another door, the only one on that side, was constructed {{in the middle of the}} western facade; its lintel is lying on the ground. On the east was an apse, whose interior are in place. Within this ancient church are several monolithic columns half hidden by the bushes; they measure 2.50 metres in length, by thirty-five centimetres in diameter. The capitals and the base are wanting, or at all events no longer visible. By the side of this building is observed a sort of subterranean magazine arched in stone with a circular arch. It is partly filled up. On the sumrnit of the hill the vestiges of a town can be recognised. It was approached by a number of steps.' ...|$|E

Opširnije se razmatra problem ukapanja pod zemljanim humcima, a delOljnom arheološkom analizom svakog pojedinog predmela nastoji se utvrditi precizno dalacija groblja. Excavations of the pre-historic n/mulus at Livade in Konjsko Field {{discovered}} 27 early-medieval graves containing 32 buried persons. The graves {{were placed}} in the battom of the tumulus and in regular lie rs, just a few of them being outside, south-west, of the tumulus. The three of the latter (graves 28, 29, 30) have rough Slane architecture, made of undressed stone blocks and covered with irregular stone slabs. Others are buried directly in the soil, just a few of them surrounded with smaller stones. All were oriented west -east. Most of the graves contain one body, and four of them contain simultaneously buried two or three bodies, all of them children with an adult person (graves 1 - 3, 8, 12 - 13, 15 - 16). All persons for whom this could be established, had their arms placed down the body. Eleven graves contained goods, mostly jewellery. ln two <b>oft</b> <b>hem</b> there were found small iron knives. Although appearing humble, the Livade graveyard in Konjsko Field has been of exceptional importance in attempts of more precise dating not only of particular grave goods, but also of similar graveyards in our lands. Although the practice of burying of the deceased in pre·historic tumuli in various epoques of the Middle Ages in our lands is not a custom of, we deem {{that in the case of}} Konjsko The historic tumulus was chosen for location ofa graveyard only for The fact that this is a rocky land, flooded a part oft he year, wherefore finding a location for burying the dead is not easy. This is, in fact a smaller settlement graveyard in tiers with Christianised deceased. In early·medieval Croatia, this kind of graveyards is characteristic for the period from the mid 91 th till the turn from the 10 th to the till centuries. Given the number of the graves discovered and that not a single case multipie layers has been found, it may be concluded that the graveyard was in use for a shorter period of time only, within the above chronological limits. Based upon analysis of the grave goods, that include goods characteristic for the pagan burial horizon of the 8 th and the early 9 th centuries (clustered earrings, rings with rhomb· or shield-shaped widening, necklaces made of multi-sectioned glass pearls), but also those usually found in the horizon characterized by Christian burial customs of the late 9 th and the 10 th centuries (four-bead temple decorations and temple decorations with vertically placed bead), dating in the second third or The second half oft he 9 th century has been proposed.

The paper publishes 2 ̆ 70 far unknown infannation on the earlymedieval COilJS {{discovered}} in southem Croatia. Afragment ofa silver denarius ofCharlemagne ofBribir near Skradin {{is kept in}} the numismatic coilection ofthe Croatian Archaeological. Wonuments Museum of Split, an imitation of golden solidus of Constantine V Copronymus and Leo IV found at Klis is in a private collection, wbereas the hoard with coins at the island of Maslinovik near Primošten and some individual finds of gak/en hislamenoi of Romanos /Il Argyros are being discussed agailJSt archive information. Tbe Charlemagne denarius belongs to the coin type featured by combinations of cross at the obverse and monogram at the reverse, or the other way round. Such denarii were produced by Frank mints west ofthe Alps and in the northern Italy,from 793 to 812. Carolingian coins are rarely found at the eastern Adriatic coasts. Only one denarius {{has been found in}} the south Croatian tenitories sofar, the one ofLotar Ifrom the Grace no. 620 fŽdrijac in !lin, minted in Mediolanum. Given the circumstances of this find, the denarius was most probably a grave contribution, pracliced very often in this period of still strong pagan customs. Asomewhat later example comes from Rose near Herceg Novi. This is probabl) 2 ̆ 7 a so called anonymous denarius, mint in the mid 9 th century, most prohahly in Venice. ln Istria there are known only two pieces of Carolingian coins, which sU 1 prises, having in mind that this penilJSula, witb Furlania, made part of the Aquileian mark, thaI is, directly under the Frank administration. To us tbe most interesting is certainly the onefrom tbe Brijuni castIUm, kept in tbe Archaeological Museum of Pula, since it is typologicallJ identical to the one ofBrihir. The second piece is the coin of Lotar J, fOit 1 ld in a grave of the old-Croatian cemetery at Mala Vrata near Buzet. The discovery ofthe Charlemagne denarius at Bribir is ill!portant since it, at least a bit, adds to the insight into tbe money circulation at this important old-Croatian locality in the early Middle Ages lt tcstifies not only ofthe contacts that the Croats madewilh the Franks in tbe beginning of the 9 & centwy, but also confirms the exceptional importance of Bribir as a centloe of the early medieval Croatian slate. The coin of Constantine VCopronymlls has been aCCidentally found near the Klis F 01 tresj. This is an imitation ofgold soNdus. The obverse depicts the husts of Constantine Vand his son Leo IV, en face,. whereas the reverse depicts the bust of Leo III, the Constantine 2 ̆ 7 s father. By its features, the coin belongs to Ihe coin type mint in the mint of Syracuse, particularly actively {{in the second half of}} the 8 th century. The period of time when such coins were circulated was from the year 760 tili the Copronimus death in 775. Dalmatian museums keep numerous coins of this type, and their finds are presented in the attached map. Their multitude in the area between the Zrmanja and the Cetina rivers, the lime and reasons of their arrival here and their function as grave contributions, especially as rela/ed to dating of graves at the important old-Croatian site of Biskupija near Knin, made them topics of scientijic discussions over a long period of time. It appears tbat tbeir presence in tbe soutbem Croatia may be explained by tbe common polilica! situatiun prevailing in the second half of tbe Btb century. This IS the time follOWing the fall of the exarchate of Ravenna, when Dalmatian towns remained tbe scarce Byzantine strongholds at the Adriatic, besides Venice, wherefore Byzant tried to secure them by giving large quantities ofgold coins 10 the Croats in their back, for the case that Byzant is to employ militarily against the strengthening Frank state. The Croatian mling strattIIn, not fa miliar with monetary economy and still undergoing Christianisation, for several decades utilised the received gold coins as valuabies only. Some oftbe coins were placed, with other objects, into graves, and some have probab!y been cast into jewellery. lt is interesting that finds ofCopronymus 2 ̆ 7 gold coins by tbe very coast and in its immediate vicinity are very felO. Actually, there is only one piece found -Ihe one of Nin. However, having in mind the area of activities of tbe Archaeological Museum of Split, that keeps most ofthese coins, althaugb lacking any infannation on the place and circumstances of their discovery, it may be concluded that suchgold wins came into possession ofseniol ofthe Croatian familws in the vicinity of Split. 77 Jis makes the discovelY of the Copronymus 2 ̆ 7 coin at Klis, which confirms this theory, only euen more impD/tant. Thanks to the archive data, new infannation have been obtained on discoveries of golden nomisma hista/nenoj of the Byzantine emperor R 01 nanos III Agryros. lt is about the 70 gold COi 17 discovered 011 the island of Maslinovik near Prim 01 ten, and individual disCQveries at Bage/ić near Dmiš and Biskupija near Knin. ln Dalmatia and Herzegovina, six herds conlaining this emperor COillS are knoum 0 / but also nlllnerous individual diswveries that can be seen al the attached map.

Lokalitet je veoma često spominjan II arheološkoj literaturi zbog nalaza natpisa kneza Muncimira, pri čemu se, na temelju lokalne predaje, pisalo o crkvi sv. Luke. Zatečeni građevni ostaci potvrđuju podatak iz pisanog povijesnog vrela, te svjedoče da je riječ o ranosrednjovjekovnoj crkvi sv. lvana obnavljanoj godine 1458. Istraživanje unutrašnjosti crkve i dijela njezina okoliša ispunjenoga kOSIlosrednjovjekovnim grobovima od kojih su neki obilježeni stećcima, dovelo je do novih spoznaja o tlocrtu, vremenu i načinu gradnje. Osim toga, istražena su 32 groba, te su prikupljeni vrijedni nalazi, među kojima se ističu ulomak antičkogmiljokaza, dijelovi predromaničkoga crkvenog namještaja, primjerci kasnosrednjovjekovnih naušnica i prstena te novca Ludovika l. AnŽuvinca. Ostaci četiriju predromaničkih ansambala, različitih po izboru i načinu obradbe geometrijskih motiva, otkrivaju daje građevina nekoliko puta obnavljana tijekom srednjeg vijeka. Ta činjenica otvara i pitanja o izvornom porijeklu pojedinih ulomaka kamenog namještaja. Nakon iskapanja i dokumentiranja zatečenog stanja ostaci crkve su konzervirani, te djelomice rekonstruirani. The author {{presents}} {{results of}} researches {{made at the}} hilltop above Čenići and Treskavice hamlets in Uzdolje, near Knin. The site is situated at the southern side of Kosovo Field, al battom of the northern slopes of Mount Promina, {{in the area of}} Uzdaije village, in the medieval Knin DistriCI (županija), the name of which (Vzdolye, Vsdoglie, Ozdolya, Usdolia, Susdoglie) was mentioned in several late-medieval documents. In the archaeological literature it has also been {{often referred to as the}} cemetery and church of St Luke, this because of the found and partly reconstrucred altar screen trabeation reading the year 895 and the name of the Croatian prince Mutimir-Muncimil; deemed 10 have originared from here, and because of rhe found group of fragments of various pieces of pre-Romanesque church furnishings. Based upon the dara found in writen historic Sources and upon identification of works of late-medieval artisis on the found remains, the paper refers to the church of St. John, reconstructed in 1458. Nowadays, remains of this medieval church are surrounded with an Orthodox cemetery, formed in the last alte hundred years or so, during which period of time the site was dug up, several medieval monuments were damaged and a number of the monumental stećak tombstones were broken Or removed from their genuine locations. Several such tombstones and tomb slabs scattered over the hillside indicate that the archaeological site spreads beyond the present-day cemetery fences. In 1993 - 1994, in a then occupied part of the Republic of Croatia, the site was excavated by the Belgrade University professor, Đorde Janković, with his assistants, who removed several Stone monuments to a nearby hamter where they were subsequently found. More detailed data on these excavations and other possible finds are not available to the author of this paper. In 2001 - 2002, there were studied interior and a part of surroundings of the medieval church, to be conserved again. Below its, partly preserved, floor there are a few remains of an older structure of undefined ground plan and purpose, and a built grave situated in the centre of the western part of the cella. The found fragment of a Roman milestone from the time of the joint rule of the emperor Valentinian l (364 - 375) and his brother Valens (364 - 378) and Gratian (367 - 383), and the double-pitched sarcophagus cover indicate the importance of this locality in the classical and the late classical periods. This Single-vessel church with a semicircular apse at the eastern end was erected in the pre-Romanesque period, as indicated by two fragments of various pieces of stone furnishings and by the way it was built, of scarcely dressed stones connected with large quantities of mortar. From its facade to the outer apex of the apse, the church is 12. 20 m long, and 6. 5 m wide. The interior width is 5 m, and the semicircular apse radius 3. 8 m, narrower than the cell. The cell and the risen presbyterium were partition ed by a Stone column with groves for inserting the oltar screen plates. found in situ. The lateral walls inner surfaces were each covered with three pairs of blind arches of T ground plan, whose protruding formerets supported the assumed vault, dividing the cell interior into three equal traves. Besides the dominating local limestone, the builders also used tufa and blocks of marl. Because of its disrepair and partial caving in, the church was reconlstructed by brothers Ivan and Luka Hrel(j) ić of Šibenik in 1458. Its outer facades were supported with three pairs of bultresses, the genuine floor was replaced with a rustical paving, the northern side of the apse was reconstructed in full, in the lateral niches there were built altar consoles, and opening in the sourhern wall was closed with stone and spolia. Besides the above mentioned fragments, in the collection ofmonuments stand out a complete anephigraphic beam and a beam with the engraved name ofthe district prefect (župan) Ivan, and the relief-decorated ambo plates. Made of marble, limestone and mari, the collected fragments do not provide for reconstruction of any of the four pre-Romanesque ensembles. This indicotes several interventions in the interior during the Middle Ages, but also opens the issue of origin of the trabeation reading the name of the prince Mutimir. The local tradition on destruction of the St. John 2 ̆ 7 s Church before the Turkish conquest has been supported by no firm evidence. ln and around this medieval church, thirty graves, distributed densely and in two layers, have been excavated. Most of them were made of drystone and stone plates, two of roughly dressed stone bound with mortar, and afew with no archileclure. ln and around Ihe graves, Ihere have been found coins of the CroatoHungarian king Ludovic d 2 ̆ 7 Anjou, a silver ring decoraled wilh incisions, gilded Iree-bead earrings, copper earrings and a silver ea/Ting with coiled thickel 1 ings, and fragments of majolica and rough, locally produced, vessels, evidencing late-medieval dates of burials here (13 th- 15 th centuries). The same dates are confirmed by stećak tombstones, distributed at the crest of the hill, a number <b>oft</b> <b>hem</b> decorated with relieves of cross and lily as well as combinations of the two motifs. In the catalogue there are also fragments of a pluteus, formerly built in the porch of the Pločaš wel/, at the western end of Uzdolje village that, for their damages and possibility of jurther decay, have been taken to the Croatian Archaeological Monuments Museum in Split.

Na prvoj nekropoli Kod križa otkriveno je 97 grobova, a na nekropoli sedamdeset metara zapadnije 23 groba. Nekropole se vremenski mogu smjestiti u razdoblje od 13. do 18. st. Nekropola Kod križa najugoistoku se prostirala prelw kamene gomile, u kojoj je, uzjedanaest kasnosrednjovjelwvnih grobova, otkriven i prapovijesni grob, te dijelovi vrča iz ranog brončanog doba. Planning the Zagreb -Zadar -Split highway, {{passing by}} {{the village of}} Koprivno, to pass over archaeological sites with a stone mound and two necropolises, {{generated}} the need of protective researches. At the first necropolis, Kod križa, there have been excavated 97 graves, and at the other one, 70 meters further to the west, 23 graves. They can be dated to the 13 th- 18 th centuries. The Kod križa necropolis spread to the south-east Over a stone mound in which, besides eleven medieval graves, {{there have also been}} discovered a prehistoric grave and fragments of an early Bronze Age jug. 1. KOD KRIŽA CEMETERY Before the research, there was visible a larger undecorated slab-shaped tombstone. At the site there were also visible several graves with drystone crowns. The main feature of the site is a trunk-shaped tumbstone, made of stećak tombstone fragments. The grave:S western side is made of a slab-shaped stećak, decorated with half-moon and circle relieves and two incised crosses. Above {{the western part of the}} grave there is a larger stone cross that gave name to the site (Kod križa = By the Cross). At the eastern part of the stone cross there is relief image ofan anthropomorphic cross and two circles lrosettes. At this late Middle-Age and New Age necropolis there have been found 97 graves. To the south-east the cemetery spread over the stone mound, and to the north and the west under the country road. The terrain on which the cemetery is located is markedly rocky, and most of the graves are cut in the bedrock. Most of the graves have, cut in the bedrock, built grave architecture, that is, they are lined with vertically set stone slabs. Occasional/y, instead of slabs, lining is made of amorphous cut rocks. Such grave is covered with several slabs from the feet to the head. Most oft he graves had a drystone crown, oval or rectangular, under which there is the grave. Some of them in the crown had a head-stone, even two head-stones. The present All Saints 2 ̆ 7 Church, at the local cemetery, was built at the end of the 19 " century, most probably on the site of an older one. At the entrance to the cemetery, north-west of the church, there are visible older graves, identical by the way of building to some of the graves of the Kod križa necropolis. Most of the grave goods fund at the Kod križa necropolis are needles, clothing buckles and simple buttons. All of them are characteristic for the late Middle Age. Dated to the New Age are shoe-sole guards, and coins -six coins of the Spanish king Carlos II (ruled 1665 - 1 700) from the child grave G 79. Since the coins are perforated, they were obviously used as decoration, a part of a necklace. ln the graves there have been also found five Turkish silver coins -the akche, and two Roman co ins, of one of them only a small fragment. The Roman coins make incidental finds, whereas the Turkish akche were official money in these parts at the time of the Turkish conquest. Most probably, they were struck in Bosnia in the 162 ̆ 7 " century. Turkish silver coins, remains of wool clothing with buckles, the grave architecture -crowned graves, as well as the historic sources, indicate that a part oft he graves can be related to the Vlachs, Turkish subjects, who settled the deserted area of Dugopolje -Koprivno in the first half oft he 16 " 2 ̆ 7 century. Burials at the Kod križa necropolis started in the 16 th and ended in the 18 th century. 2. STONE MO UND Besides this stone mound, there are several more in Koprivno, and several empty graves in smaller mounds are visible above Nazlići. Our stone mollnd is situated south-east of the necropolis, its base oval shaped, 19. 5 m in radius, and up to 1. 4 m in height. Next to the already known late Middle-Age and NewAge graves (eleven graves) at the eastern end of the mould, there has been excavated a pre-historic grave (G S 5 A), shaped like a stone trunk. The grave, 90 x 40 cm in size, contained bones of a male person (50 - 55 years old) buried in the bent position and no grave goods. Starohrvatslw. prosvjeta lIT/ 32 (2005.) _ _ _. _ _ _ _. _- - - o _ _ [...] _ [...] -Sepulchral monuments -stone mounds, were created in the pre-historic epoque, but were practicedfor burials in the classical period and, even more, in the Middle Ages. The only pre-historic grave in che moOuld of Koprivno is found at its eastern end. As the first one created, it should have been located closer to its centre. It has been shifted to its end, probably, by moving of the mound westward, because of clearing of the land for agriculture, or because ofeleven new burials in the late Middle Ages. Almost in the centre of the mound, 100 cm deep, there have been found fragments of a black clay jug. This is probably a vessel used for the burial cult purposes. The jug is identical to the similar examples from mounds around the spring, and belongs to the early Bronze Age, indicating the time of building of the mound and the burial. In the later Middle Ages, the mound was used in widening of the nearby necropolis. 3. KOPRiVNO -CEMETERY BY THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE JAKOV NAZLIĆ 2 ̆ 7 S FENCE Another necropolis in Koprivno is situated about 70 m west of the Kod križa site. 23 graves have been excavated there. Most of the graves are oriented E -W, with minor deviations, and five <b>oft</b> <b>hem</b> NE -SW One third of the graves are buried in the soil, and others cut in the bedrock. Graves 6, 9, 18 and 19 have no sepulchral architecture. Others have the common sepulchral architecture, consisting of stone slabs, more rarely of amorphous rocks used to line the grave. Grave 10 stands out by being located above the grave II and by the deceased person 2 ̆ 7 s head being separated from the rest of the body with a stone slab. The first impression was that the head was buried alone, without the body. Four graves (5, 9, J 3, 15) have been empty, with no traces of a body. Only in two graves there have been found remains of another body, that is, the graves were used for two burials each. Such "poor utilisation" of the graves could indicate short duration of the necropolis, not more than a century. Finds have been found in female graves only (three-bead earrings, rings with coiled thickenings, coins). By comparison with three-bead earrings and earrings with three coiled thickenings from other sires, and according to the Verona town coins found, this small necrapolis can be dated from the end of the 132 ̆ 7 " to the end oft he 14 th centuries.
