In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> are married under age, and 1:9 before 15.

The percentage <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1.
