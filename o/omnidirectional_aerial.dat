50|$|The Eiðar longwave {{transmitter}} is {{a facility}} of the Icelandic Broadcasting Company used for longwave broadcasting on 207 kHz {{with a power}} of 100 kW. The Eiðar Longwave transmitter situated at Eiðar near Egilsstaðir uses as antenna an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerial</b> {{in the form of}} a steel lattice mast radiator insulated against the ground with a height of 221 metres.Originally a taller mast was planned, but this was impossible because of flight safety reasons.|$|E
50|$|The Zeesen short-wave {{transmitter}} was a 70-metre-high shortwave radio transmission mast constructed at Zeesen in Germany in 1931. Consisting of a lattice tower of pitch pine timbers, {{it was one}} of Germany's first short-wave broadcasting transmitters. It was equipped with four transmitting arms, at 90-degree separation, surmounted by two omnidirectional aerials. In 1939, the wooden tower was replaced by a 70-metre high steel mast with a single <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerial.</b> This mast was dismantled, together with all the Zeesen transmitters, in 1945.|$|E
50|$|It {{was part}} of an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerial,</b> {{consisting}} of four 200-metre-high radio masts, which were connected using wires on their tops. The middle mast was fed via radio power. This very efficient transmission aerial led to interference with the Romanian transmitter Braşov on the same frequency, so only 70 kilowatts of power were used, instead of 250. But even with this reduced power, jamming of Braşov occurred, so in 1972 the radio facility Donebach was rebuilt as a directional aerial with a minimum towards Braşov. Therefore two radio masts were taken down and the remaining two were rebuilt as umbrella aerials. This made a transmission power of 250 kilowatts possible.|$|E
50|$|For VLF, LF, MF and HF the ERP is {{typically}} not determined separately. In {{most cases the}} transmission power found in lists of transmitters is the value for {{the output of the}} transmitter. This is only correct for <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerials</b> with a length of a quarter wavelength or shorter. For other aerial types there are gain factors, which can reach values until 50 for shortwave directional beams in the direction of maximum beam intensity.|$|R
5000|$|This {{leaves the}} problem of {{determining}} whether the signal is north-east or south-west, as the ellipse is equally long {{on both sides of}} the display centre-point. To solve this problem a separate aerial, the [...] "sense aerial", was added to this mix. This was an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerial</b> located a fixed distance from the loops about 1/2 of a wavelength away. When this signal was mixed in, the opposite-phase signal from this aerial would strongly suppress the signal when the phase is in the direction of the sense aerial. This signal was sent into the brightness channel, or Z-axis, of the oscilloscope, causing the display to disappear when the signals were out of phase. By connecting the sense aerial to one of the loops, say the north-south channel, the display would be strongly suppressed when it was on the lower half of the display, indicating that the signal is somewhere to the north. At this point the only possible bearing is the north-east one.|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) technology {{provides a}} wireless means {{to detect and}} identify objects. By using RFID reader as detecting sensor, an RFID-assisted object tracking system is developed to track the object movement for a flexible manufacturing assembly line. Both range-based and range-free cooperative object tracking algorithms are analyzed for the system. And to achieve tradeoff between the reader plate's density and cost, only simple readers with <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>aerial</b> are considered in this article. To further enhance the assembly line efficiency, a particle filter model is developed to further process the object tracking results to improve the tracking accuracy. The proposed tracking system can also forecast the movement state of objects in the assembly lines. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited...|$|E
