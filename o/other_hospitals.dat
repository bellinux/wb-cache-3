In the 2000s, the hospital was changed from a primary and secondary care to a specialized tertiary care center, receiving complex cases from <b>other</b> <b>hospitals</b> and clinics in the region, but around 60% of patients in the hospital are still cases that could be handled by local health centers.|$|E
5|$|Racz {{was born}} in Hungary and, as a young man, had {{aspirations}} to become a medical doctor. He was a second-year medical student in November 1956 when {{he was forced to}} flee Hungary after the Soviets invaded Budapest in response to the Hungarian Revolution. He eventually arrived in England and resumed his education. He graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine, and worked in the UK until 1963 at which time he moved to the United States. He completed his anesthesiology residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He also worked as an associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant for <b>other</b> <b>hospitals</b> including the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York before moving to Lubbock, Texas where he became the first Chairman of Anesthesiology for the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC).

5|$|The {{hospital}} of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, {{was established by}} Bishop Andreas before 1237 for {{the aid of the}} poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with <b>other</b> <b>hospitals,</b> have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.|$|E

5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. The patients were eventually moved to <b>other</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.|$|E

25|$|As U.S. cities {{grew more}} crowded in the mid-19th century, philanthropist Sampson Simson (1780-1857) founded a {{hospital}} {{to address the}} needs of New York's rapidly growing Jewish immigrant community. It was the second Jewish hospital in the United States. At the time of its founding in 1852, <b>other</b> <b>hospitals</b> in New York City discriminated against Jews by not hiring them and preventing them from being treated in their wards.|$|E
25|$|The {{closure of}} monasteries by the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as}} the closure of <b>other</b> <b>hospitals</b> and {{charitable}} institutions, forced numerous women into marriage. While priests' concubines had previously received some degree of social acceptance, marriage did not necessarily remove the stigma of concubinage, nor could a wife claim the wage to which a female servant might be entitled. Marriages to Protestant clerics became a means for urban bourgeois families to establish their commitment to the Reformation.|$|E
