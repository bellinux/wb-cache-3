Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck.

Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Titanic</b> built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking.

The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.
