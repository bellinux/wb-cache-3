His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E

2500|$|The druk (Dzongkha: འབྲུག་; Wylie: 'brug), or [...] "thunder dragon" [...] of Bhutanese mythology, {{has been}} the {{national}} symbol of Bhutan since long before the establishment of government in 1907. Since the seventeenth century, Bhutan's self-designation has been Drukyul ("Land of the Thunder Dragon"), or Dru-gäkhap ("Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon"). The Druk is heavily associated with the dominant Drukpa sect of Buddhism, the state religion under Bhutan's dual system of government. This sect was founded in western Tibet by Drogon Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje (1161–1211), who with his disciples witnessed nine dragons roaring <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> and into the skies, as flowers rained down everywhere.

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), before any shrub or grass had yet sprouted on earth, and before God had sent rain for the earth, a flow would well {{up from the}} ground to water the earth. God formed man from the dust, blew the breath of life into his nostrils, and made him a living being. God planted a garden in the east in Eden, caused to grow there every good and {{pleasing}} tree, and placed the tree of life and the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil {{in the middle of the}} garden. A river issued from Eden to water the garden, and then divided into four branches: the Pishon, which winds through Havilah, where the gold is; the Gihon, which winds through Cush; the Tigris, which flows east of Asshur; and the Euphrates. God placed the man in the garden of Eden to till and tend it, and freed him to eat from every tree of the garden, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that if the man ate of it, he would surely die. Announcing that it was not good for man to be alone and that God would make for him a fitting helper, God formed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> all the beasts and birds and brought them to the man to name.

2500|$|Tomkinson surveys what {{he regards}} as {{historical}} attitudes to hell. He {{says that the}} common manner of pagan writers was {{to see it as}} a place of cleansing and purifying rather than of punishment. A more modern view was that of Jacob Boehme that heaven and hell are within one another. Tomkinson jests, [...] "but of late there is made a new discovery of another world placed in the moon and as habitable as this is." [...] But none of these speculations is correct. Hell will be this earth after the end of time. [...] "I will judge thee in the place thou wast created." [...] "Their iniquity shall be upon their bones." [...] The elect will be quickened to eternal life and the damned will be quickened to their torment. The damned shall come out of their graves as worms <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> and, after they have seen the elect rise up with Christ to heaven; the sun, stars and moon will cave in aflame. Then there will be blackness within and without as the earth is abandoned by God forever. The life of the damned will be to die forever in a hell that is their own bodies, tormented by the remembrance of sins they can never shake off. [...] "Every evil action will arise afresh in the mind." [...] Tomkinson is poetic, not forgiving. [...] "There will never be any intermission of pain, for as soon as one phial of wrath is drank off, another is presented without stop or stay, coming rolling one upon another, like waves of the sea." [...] This treatment will ensure new blasphemies against God for all eternity. With unusual grimness, Tomkinson remarks that if the reprobate seed [...] "can make shift to disbelieve it, they may have the more ease and time to fit them for the everlasting burning by making their bodies and spirits like a dry thorny hedge, to receive the fury of that fire." ...|$|E
