5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
