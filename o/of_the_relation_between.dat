5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E
5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao's {{victory to}} one single strategic decision — the defender's choice of location. Leban asserts that Cao Cao chose Guandu {{as the place}} to make his stand because of his superior understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> topography, logistics, and tactics over Yuan Shao. It was the issue about logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao's supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|Basis risk {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk {{is a direct result}} of the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. It is obvious that high basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.|$|E

25|$|Stanislaw Ulam, {{and some}} writing on his behalf, {{have claimed that}} related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied {{mathematics}} in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, {{a continuation of the}} work of Emmy Noether (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that understanding a type of mathematical structure requires understanding the processes that preserve that structure. To achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> structures and the processes that preserve them.|$|E
25|$|Symmetric polynomials arise {{naturally}} {{in the study}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From {{this point of view}} the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.|$|E
25|$|Signs, {{meanings}} in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, {{and through the}} social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of Philip Tagg (Ten Little Tunes, Fernando the Flute, Music’s Meanings) provides {{one of the most}} complete and systematic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of Leonard Meyer in Style and Music theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.|$|E

25|$|It is {{especially}} in the case of the church that we find in Christian speculation prior to Valentinus traces of the conception, which lies at the root of the whole doctrine of Aeons, that earthly things have their archetypes in preexistent heavenly things. Hermas (Vis. ii. 4) speaks of the church as created before all things and of the world as formed for her sake; and in the newly discovered portion of the so-called Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (c. 14) the writer speaks of the spiritual church as created before the sun and moon, as pre-existent like Christ Himself, and like him manifested in the last days for men's salvation; and he even uses language which, if it were not sufficiently accounted for by what is said in the Epistle to the Ephesians as to the union between Christ and His church, might be supposed to have affinity with the Valentinian doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> Anthropos and Ecclesia.|$|E
25|$|The iris flower is of {{interest}} as an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> flowering plants and pollinating insects. The shape of the flower and {{the position of the}} pollen-receiving and stigmatic surfaces on the outer petals form a landing-stage for a flying insect, which in probing for nectar, will first come into contact with the perianth, then with the stigmatic stamens in one whorled surface which is borne on an ovary formed of three carpels. The shelf-like transverse projection on the inner whorled underside of the stamens is beneath the overarching style arm below the stigma, so that the insect comes in contact with its pollen-covered surface only after passing the stigma; in backing out of the flower it will come in contact only with the non-receptive lower face of the stigma. Thus, an insect bearing pollen from one flower will, in entering a second, deposit the pollen on the stigma; in backing out of a flower, the pollen which it bears will not be rubbed off on the stigma of the same flower.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other historicists, Weber also {{accepted}} the marginal theory of value (also called [...] "marginalism") and taught {{it to his}} students. In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected {{the form of the}} psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber-Fechner law. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of psychophysics by Lionel Robbins, George Stigler, and Friedrich Hayek, though the broader issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of [...] "behavioral economics".|$|E
