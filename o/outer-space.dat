5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and <b>outer-space</b> tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of <b>outer-space</b> firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E
25|$|Orbit is {{the name}} given to MLB's Houston Astros mascot, a lime-green <b>outer-space</b> {{creature}} wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons until the 2000 season, where Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. Orbit returned on November 2, 2012 at the unveiling of the Astros new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname Space City.|$|E

Law and the city's central government are enforced by Colonial-Marshal Judges; indigenous aliens and MC-1 colonialists are often oppressed and some cause insurgencies. Military forces are often mentioned as being space based (see Military). The spin-off strip Insurrection {{showed that the}} Special Judicial Service have an <b>outer-space</b> army to deal with any colonies where the judicial staff declare independence. The main push into space began roughly in 2095, under Chief Judge Goodman, {{as a way of}} supplying the city with resources that a post-war Earth could no longer provide. The most famous colony is the penal colony on Titan, where corrupt Judges are sent.|$|E
500|$|The {{technical}} findings, {{released on}} 30 August 1958 {{in a report}} drafted by the Soviet delegation, were endorsed by the US and UK, which proposed that they {{serve as the basis}} for test-ban and international-control negotiations. However, the experts' report failed to address precisely who would do the monitoring and when on-site inspections—a US demand and Soviet concern—would be permitted. The experts also deemed detection of <b>outer-space</b> tests (tests more than [...] above the earth's surface) to be impractical. Additionally, the size of the Geneva System may have rendered it too expensive to be put into effect. The 30 August report, which contained details on these limitations, received significantly less public attention than the 21 August communiqué.|$|E
500|$|Two-thirds of {{the album}} is {{produced}} by Organized Noize, OutKast's primary production team. The rest is produced by Earthtone III, a production team that includes OutKast themselves and Mr. DJ. [...] André 3000 and Big Boi produced the songs [...] "Jazzy Belle" [...] and [...] "Elevators (Me & You)". It also has a notably more laid-back, spacey production sound, which they expanded upon on their follow-up album Aquemini. [...] Although the group drew from George Clinton's <b>outer-space</b> inspired compositions, the band utilizes a more laid-back style as opposed to Clinton's hard funk leanings. Many tracks feature strong echo and reverb, taking influence from dub and reggae. [...] Andrea Comer of The Hartford Courant perceives an [...] "extraterrestrial feel" [...] in the record's production.|$|E
500|$|On 13 April 1959, facing Soviet {{opposition}} to on-site detection systems for underground tests, Eisenhower proposed {{moving from a}} single, comprehensive test ban to a graduated agreement where atmospheric tests—those up to 50km (31mi) high, a limit Eisenhower would revise upward in May 1959—would be banned first, with negotiations on underground and <b>outer-space</b> tests continuing. This proposal was turned down on 23 April 1959 by Khrushchev, calling it a [...] "dishonest deal." [...] On 26 August 1959, the US announced it would extend its year-long testing moratorium {{to the end of}} 1959, and would not conduct tests after that point without prior warning. The Soviet Union reaffirmed that it would not conduct tests if the US and UK continued to observe a moratorium.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{first two}} songs are a one-two {{introduction}} to the rapper and what he is up to. There is a gloomy interior monologue about success, the lack of it, and Cudi's inner conflicts, where he welcomes listeners by saying they are in his dreams. [...] "Soundtrack 2 My Life" [...] is a more courageous theme song where he proclaims, [...] "This is the soundtrack to my life". In it he states that his family {{did not see the}} sadness in him and that he has not been right since his father's death. The third track, {{which is part of the}} second half of the introduction, has an <b>outer-space</b> style, which is due in part to the Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark group sample, and showcases the rapper's readiness to experiment.|$|E
500|$|In the UK, {{journalist}} Penny Valentine, {{writing in}} Disc magazine, described the album as {{a return to}} form for the Byrds, before declaring that the band were [...] "back where they belong with a sound as fresh as cream and sunflowers." [...] Melody Maker was also enthusiastic about the album, commenting, [...] "if you ignore this album you are not only foolish – but deaf!". [...] Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP: [...] "This is an exciting album, at times brash and noisy ('So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face'), spooky (the science-fiction <b>outer-space</b> sounds on 'C.T.A.-102'), folksy ('Everybody's Been Burned'), weird (the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens'), and pleasant (the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name'). A lot of thought has gone into this album and it's good because of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the release}} was [...] "generally ecstatic", {{according}} to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's [...] "aural invention". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine Mirabelle wrote: [...] "Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang {{at the end of}} Revolver." [...] In his review for the NME, Allen Evans said, in response to the lyric's exhortation to [...] "relax and float downstream": [...] "But how can you relax with the electronic, <b>outer-space</b> noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural." [...] Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: [...] "You need some sort of aural microscope to get the message from this. But it's darned compelling listening." [...] Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner said that those who had been confused by the lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love.|$|E
500|$|Alien Spidy is a physics-based {{platformer}} video game. Players {{control the}} eponymous Spidy, an extraterrestrial spider, and navigate {{him through a}} series of levels that are filled with deadly obstacles. Spidy can run and jump, and has the ability to shoot a web, allowing him to grapple and swing from object to object within the environment. Interspersed throughout each level are a large number of orbs, which Spidy can collect to score points. Finishing the level quickly, collecting a large number of orbs, collecting several orbs in quick succession, and finding score multipliers all increase the player's score for that level. Players can also lose points by dying, collecting certain orbs that decrease the player's score, or going for too long without collecting an orb. [...] Players earn between one and five stars on each level, based on their score. Levels are grouped into several stages, including a forest, a pond, a cave system, and <b>outer-space.</b> In order to progress from one stage to the next, players must collect a certain number of stars. Players can collect special power-up orbs scattered throughout levels. These orbs allow Spidy to perform feats he is otherwise incapable of, including traveling underwater and jumping to extreme heights. There are 69 levels in the game, and most of them take between 90 seconds and three minutes.|$|E
500|$|Tsarapkin responded {{positively}} to the US proposal, though was {{wary of the}} prospect of allowing underground tests registering below magnitude 4.75. In its own proposal offered 19 March 1960 the Soviet Union accepted most US provisions, with certain amendments. First, the Soviet Union asked that underground tests under magnitude 4.75 be banned {{for a period of}} four-to-five years, subject to extension. Second, it sought to prohibit all <b>outer-space</b> tests, whether within detection range or not. Finally, the Soviet Union insisted that the inspection quota be determined on a political basis, not a scientific one. The Soviet offer faced a mixed reception. In the US, Senator Hubert Humphrey and [...] the Federation of American Scientists (which was typically seen as supportive of a test ban) saw it as a clear step towards an agreement. Conversely, AEC chairman John A. McCone and Senator Clinton Presba Anderson, chair of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, argued that the Soviet system would be unable to prevent secret tests. That year, the AEC published a report arguing that the continuing testing moratorium risked [...] "free world supremacy in nuclear weapons," [...] and that renewed testing was critical for further weapons development. The joint committee also held hearings in April which cast doubt on the technical feasibility and cost of the proposed verification measures. Additionally, Teller continued to warn of the dangerous consequences of a test ban and the Department of Defense (including Neil H. McElroy and Donald A. Quarles, until recently its top two officials) pushed to continue testing and expand missile stockpiles.|$|E

[...] The fourth episode Time Squad review by Stanley Reynolds of The Times stated, [...] "...nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror."

[...] It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. But is that dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake's <b>outer-space</b> merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna? [...] Maid Marian never had that trouble in Sherwood Forest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{has a very}} {{different}} tone from the previous books in the series. This is partly {{because it is a}} romance, and partly because the book bounces around in time more erratically than its predecessors. Adams even injects a humorous sub-plot. There is less <b>outer-space</b> time than in the previous books; Arthur leaves the new Earth only in the final chapters. The different tone also reflects the rushed nature of the writing; Adams' editor Sonny Mehta moved in with the author to ensure that the book met its (extended) deadline. As a result, Adams later stated that he was not entirely happy with the book, which includes several jarring authorial intrusions, which fellow author and Adams' biographer Neil Gaiman described as [...] "patronising and unfair".|$|E
2500|$|The double {{platinum}} album, ATLiens, {{was released}} on August 27, 1996. The album exhibited a notably more laid-back, spacey production sound, taking influence from dub and reggae. On ATLiens, André 3000 and Big Boi abandoned the [...] "hard-partying playa characters" [...] of their debut album {{in favor of more}} spacey, futuristic personas, and produced many of the songs on their own for the first time. Their tracks have an <b>outer-space</b> feeling to them- a feeling that, ironically, has warmed the community right up to them. [...] Critics praised the group's maturing musical style on the record, which debuted at number two on the U.S. The album would climb to number three on Billboard's top R/Hip Hop chart.Billboard 200 chart and sold nearly 350,000 copies in its first two weeks of release. The single [...] "Elevators (Me & You)" [...] reached number 12 and spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ATLiens further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement. The album helped the group earn more recognition among East Coast hip hop fans in the East and West coasts.|$|E
2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard <b>outer-space</b> Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known recorded use of {{the term}} [...] "nerdcore hip hop" [...] was in 2000 by MC Frontalot. However, prior to that time artists as varied as the Beastie Boys, Kool Keith, Deltron 3030, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, MC Paul Barman, Company Flow, and MF Doom began exploring topics far outside the traditional hip hop culture, including stereotypically [...] "nerdy" [...] topics like space and science fiction. Though these underground artists were generally outside geek culture and are not considered nerdcore, they can be said to have set the stage for artists like Frontalot, who has listed several of them as influences. The Beastie Boys <b>outer-space</b> sci-fi themed album Hello Nasty in 1998; including, among other potentially influencing tracks, the spacey robotic Intergalactic and the distinctively video game sound themed song UNITE; garnered mainstream recognition years ahead of the popular movement. Nerdcore had clear influences from geek culture as well, including geek rockers like They Might Be Giants, parodists like [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic (who released a rap called [...] "I Can't Watch This" [...] in 1992, as well as [...] "It's All About The Pentiums" [...] in 1999 and [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] in 2006), and others. [...] Despite these influences, nerdcore has separated itself from other types of nerdy music thanks to an unofficial list of criteria that has evolved among fans and artists. [...] Aside from making hip hop about geeky things, nerdcore is considered to be an [...] "opt-in" [...] genre. Only artists who consider themselves to be [...] "nerdcore" [...] should have the label attached to their music.|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} several {{tasks in}} preparation for Mata Nui's reawakening, the Toa Nuva are teleported to Karda Nui - the cavern-like core of the Matoran Universe - to finally complete their destiny. Finding members from the Brotherhood of Makuta sent by Teridax battling a group of Matoran warriors, the heroes - equipped {{with the ability to}} fly thanks to new [...] "adaptive" [...] armor and weapons - split into two teams: Kopaka, Lewa and Pohatu remain in the skies to protect the villagers, while Tahu, Gali and Onua descend to the Swamp of Secrets to retrieve the Kanohi Ignika previously worn by Matoro to heal the Great Spirit. Kopaka's team receive support from three Av-Matoran (Matoran of Light) and a manifestation of the Mask of Life calling itself [...] "Toa Ignika", while fighting a band of bat-like Makuta and their Shadow Matoran servants. Tahu's team, unaware that the Ignika is aiding the battle above, are threatened by three more Makuta, mutated by the waters of the swamp. Both groups reunite outside the Codrex, a giant metal sphere that sits at the swamp's centre, after retrieving six keystones to open it. Inside, the Toa discover powerful battle vehicles among ancient technology as well as the origins to their lives before arriving on Mata Nui island. The heroes use the vehicles in a final all-out battle against the Brotherhood and receive help from a half-light drained Takanuva who also manages to turn the Shadow Matoran back to their former states. Later, the Toa Ignika sacrifices itself to awaken Mata Nui, causing an energy storm that the Toa and Av-Matoran narrowly escape. The Makuta, however, realizing that Teridax had in fact sent them to their deaths, are obliterated by the storm. Thanks to the Ignika's actions, the physical form of Mata Nui rises from beneath the Endless Ocean {{for the first time in}} 1,000 years; destroying the now-barren island of Mata Nui in the process. The Toa Nuva and Takanuva arrive back in Metru Nui to join the celebrations of Mata Nui's reawakening with the Matoran and Turaga. But in the midst of the festivity, Teridax's laughter echoes throughout the city. The Makuta, thought to be long since dead, reveals that he has taken over Mata Nui's body - the giant robotic humanoid vessel that houses the entire Matoran Universe - before Mata Nui's spirit could return. As his reign of terror begins, Teridax seals his victory by placing Mata Nui's spirit inside the Mask of Life and ejecting it into <b>outer-space,</b> sending the former Great Spirit on a journey into the unknown.|$|E
