5|$|In June 1984, {{the annual}} San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade was {{dedicated}} {{for the first}} time to people with AIDS. Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> have led the parade since the mid-1970s and People With AIDS followed immediately behind.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. <b>On</b> <b>bikes</b> with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. <b>On</b> <b>bikes</b> with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E

5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input <b>on</b> <b>bikes</b> is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. <b>On</b> <b>bikes</b> with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E

25|$|Peter Woodcock's prized {{possession}} {{was a red}} {{and white}} Schwinn bicycle on which he satisfied his continuing compulsion to wander. He rode the bike to {{the far reaches of}} the city—even during the deep, cold Toronto winters—and evolved a fantasy in which he led a gang of 500 invisible boys <b>on</b> <b>bikes</b> called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'. His foster parents were aware of this fantasy and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto on his bike and sexually assaulting children.|$|E
500|$|The Bay Area was, {{along with}} New York City, {{one of the}} two birthplaces of the Abstract Expressionism {{movement}} of painting. It is associated with the works of Clyfford Still, who began teaching at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in 1946, leaving a lasting impact on the artistic styles of Bay Area painters up to the present day. A few years later, Abstract Expressionist painter David Park painted Kids <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> in 1950, which retained many aspects of abstract expressionism but with original distinguishing features that would later lead to the Bay Area Figurative Movement. While both the Figurative Movement and the Abstract Expressionism movement arose from art schools, Funk art would later rise out of the region's underground and was characterized by informal sharing of technique among groups of friends and art showcases in [...] "cooperative" [...] galleries instead of formal museums. Later, the Bay Area art movement would be heavily influenced by the counterculture movement in the 1960s, and art produced during this time reflected the political environment.|$|E
500|$|Other {{than the}} {{contraceptive}} and treatment in emergencies, ponies from the Maryland herd are treated much like other wildlife, with no extra {{attention paid to}} them by Park Service employees. It is thought likely that the Maryland herd carries equine infectious anemia (EIA); they are effectively quarantined, however, by allowing no riding or camping with privately owned horses along the mainland shore during the insect season which stretches from mid-May to October. Due to their treatment as wild animals, ponies from the Maryland herd can be aggressive, {{and there have been}} reports of them tearing down tents and biting, kicking and knocking down visitors. In 2010, after an increase in biting incidents, the National Park Service implemented new measures for educating visitors about the ponies. These measures included new safety information in brochures and recommended viewing distances between the visitors and the ponies. There is also some danger to the ponies from the visitors: ponies have become ill from being fed inappropriate human foods, and on average one Maryland pony a year is killed by a car. Since 1991 there has been a [...] "Pony Patrol", where volunteers <b>on</b> <b>bikes</b> patrol the island, educating visitors about the ponies.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{distinctive}} way of speaking for a female community is that of female bikers. Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes,</b> a mostly lesbian group, and Ladies of Harley, a mostly heterosexual group, have demonstrated shared experiences. Though the two cultures differ, both have a focus on female bonding and motorcycles and have a shared female biker language. [...] Their shared language helps to establish their shared identity in a largely male-dominated domain and to mark boundaries between them and traditional femininity.|$|E
2500|$|The term countersteering is {{also used}} by some authors {{to refer to the}} need <b>on</b> <b>bikes</b> to steer in the {{opposite}} direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage. Motorcycle speedway racing takes place on an oval track with a loose surface of dirt, cinders or shale. [...] Riders slide their machines sideways, powersliding or broadsiding into the turns, using an extreme form of this type of countersteering that is maintained throughout the turn.|$|E
2500|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the recent [...] rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycle. A rider from Stockholm interviewed for {{an article about the}} phenomenon notes that riding a bike imparts a feeling of freedom to the rider. [...] One is free to go wherever one wants, whenever one wants. A sense of belonging is also important; as the rider says, [...] "all who cycle are my friends". Riders unknown to each other commonly greet each other when <b>on</b> <b>bikes.</b> As in many subcultures, this feeling of belonging is a key factor in recruiting and retaining participants.|$|E

Germany's highest court later ruled that transporting people <b>on</b> <b>bikes</b> was legal. It is a modern and newly designed pedicab (CityCruiser) with a 500-watt electric assist motor. Although these electric-assist pedicabs were engineered in Germany they are manufactured in the Czech Republic and some clones are now also produced in China. The Chinese clone can be purchased for about 3,000 US dollars; the German original is around 6,000 US dollars ( [...] the newest version, 9000+ €). The batteries last about 4 hours with a full charge. As with a few recumbent and semi-recumbent designs, some drivers may suffer with knee and joint pain due to the weight of the vehicle (145kg).|$|E
2500|$|Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes,</b> {{formerly}} known as Women's Motorcycle Contingent (WMC) for legal purposes, has several hundred motorcycle riders, almost all women-identified although they welcome all gender-variant people. [...] Some of the women are topless, some wear leather or fanciful costumes. The sound of hundreds of motorcycle engines gives this contingent a big impact. They are traditionally the first contingent in the parade; {{one reason for this}} is that it's difficult for motorcycles to run reliably at the walking pace of the rest of the parade, so as the first contingent they can move at an easier pace. On November 13, 2006, they won a battle to trademark the name [...] "Dykes on Bikes", having struggled since 2003 to persuade the United States Patent and Trademark Office that [...] "dyke" [...] was not an offensive word.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{prominent}} example of lesbian slang is the rising reappropriation {{of the word}} [...] "dyke". Though still in many contexts considered pejorative, dyke {{has become a symbol}} for increasing acceptance of the lesbian movement and identity. Lesbians themselves use it to further solidarity and unity among their community. Examples include dyke marches (female-exclusive pride parades), [...] "dykes with tykes" [...] (describing lesbian motherhood), and Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> (a motorcycle group that traditionally leads the San Francisco Pride parade). Like other minorities, female homosexuals are slowly reclaiming a word that was once used to hurt them in the past. [...] This even had legal repercussions, in that the [...] "Dykes on Bikes" [...] group was formerly known as the [...] "Women's Motorcycle Contingent" [...] since they were refused the right to register under their preferred name by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, until 2006 when they finally were able to trademark the name, having persuaded the Office that [...] "dyke" [...] was not an offensive word.|$|E

50|$|The first formal {{appearance}} of the Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> was in 1976 at San Francisco's Pride parade where the riders were placed first as motorcycles don't always run reliably at the walking pace {{of the rest of}} the parade and as first contingent they can move faster. Although the original group self-identified as Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> and they were known as such, over the years they used the Women’s Motorcycle Contingent/ Dykes <b>on</b> <b>Bikes</b> to encompass those who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or any of the newer gender-bending terms like femme, androgyne and boi.|$|E
