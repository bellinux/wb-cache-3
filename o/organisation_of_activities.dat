40|$|The nests {{built by}} social insects {{are among the}} most complex {{structures}} produced by animal groups. They reveal the social behaviour of a colony and as such they potentially allow comparative studies. However, for a long time, research on nest architecture was hindered by the lack of technical tools allowing the visualisation of their complex 3 D structures and the quantification of their properties. Several techniques, developed over the years, now make it possible to study the organisation of these nests and how they are built. Here, we review present knowledge of the mechanisms of nest construction, and how nest structure affects the behaviour of individual insects and the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> within a colony.

Wilson [22] first introduced a Sequential Alignment Method (SAM) for activity pattern analysis. The method originated in molecular biology and aims to identify segments of similarity between sequences of DNA or protein. The SAM has recently gained popularity in comparing the similarity between activity patterns [23 – 28]. Note that beyond the perspective of a day-to-day variability study, the search for repetitive activity-travel behaviour, through attributes of activities and/or trips, is indeed another research issue [7], which {{is beyond the scope of}} this study.|$|E

The changes which are occurring are technological, economic, environmental, social, demographic, political and regulatory. The key agents of this change are telecommunications, information technology and transport. Transport and communication have always been key agents of change and their impact has been reinforced by their present rapid rates of development and by their use in combination. They are creating global networks which, in turn, are enabling global markets and a broader spatial <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> such as production of goods and services.

40|$|Co-curricular {{activity}} {{as part of}} non-formal education is often viewed as a primary context of development for school students. Many studies suggest that students who participate in co-curricular activities benefit {{in a number of}} ways such as positive developmental outcomes, higher educational attainment and achievement, reduced problem behavior and positive psycho-social adjustment. Thus, co-curricular activities are seen to both supplement existing academic curricula and allow students the opportunity to build non-academic, civic and political skills. Realising this potential, this paper attempts to discuss the effectiveness of tourism clubs in secondary schools, in terms of <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> and to determine their constraints and potential, based on findings from interviews. Interviews were conducted on teacher coordinators at selected secondary schools in Penang, and the study found that different schools provide different participate opportunities to students.

40|$|Following Richardson (1972), {{capabilities}} comprise tacit, personal, {{subjective and}} context-specific knowledge {{that may be}} shared in practice only with difficulty across small, task oriented groups within firms or other types of organisation, and are expressed {{in the form of}} activities. The definition has been influential, and its focus on tacit knowledge has, arguably, encouraged research activities in the form of studies adopting experimental and simulation techniques, while providing less impetus for complementary empirical inquiry. This paper presents an empirical inquiry into an aspect of the development of capabilities in the UK's upstream oil and gas industry promoted by the changing <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> across oil companies and contracting and supply companies. The main argument is that researchers can gain partial and subjective access to capabilities - distinct from activities - because individuals involved in the industry articulate and codify understandings of capabilities through practical theorising and commercial experimenting.

40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} provides powerful {{techniques for}} formalising {{the art of}} engineering problem solving: for modelling products, describing task structures, and representing problem solving expertise as inference knowledge and control knowledge. Signposting systems extend the scope of these methods beyond automatic design by using them to provide both information and guidance for decisionmaking by human designers. This paper outlines the application of AI methods according to cognitive engineering considerations, {{to the development of}} knowledge management tools for engineering design. These tools go beyond conventional knowledge management and decision support approaches by supplying both inference knowledge and strategic problem solving knowledge to the user, as well as information {{about the state of the}} design. By focusing on tasks and on the dependencies between design parameters, signposting systems support contingent and flexible <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> Such tools can support product modelling, design process planning and capturing expert design knowledge, in a form that can be used directly to guide the organisation of design activities and the performance of individual tasks. A key element of this approach is the incremental acquisition of product models, task structures and problem solving knowledge by defining variant cases. ...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the role}} of the teacher and their {{relation}} to pupils during the instructional process as well as the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> by the teacher, this paper actualises the current views related to the role the teacher has in interactive teaching. The teacher is the basic instigator of interaction with his/her pupils and he/she can be such an instigator only with well organised teaching. Interactive teaching, a promising approach, represents a challenge not only for the teachers but for the professional service as well. The traditional teaching, dominated by a verbal approach and memorising of the teaching material, is entirely replaced with other activities, both in the process of following the teaching and in the process of learning the material. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the level of application of interactive teaching in the educational process, since practicing of interactive teaching by the teachers, during this paper represents only a part of authentic results from the two combined researches, one part of results obtained via survey sheets given to the teachers of nine schools and a part of the results from interviews taken with the professional service as a focus group...|$|E

40|$|There is wide {{agreement}} {{on the importance of}} scaffolding for student learning. Yet, models of individual and face-to-face scaffolding are not necessarily applicable to educational settings in which a group of learners is pursuing a process of inquiry mediated by technology.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess three tutors ’ contributions to university students ’ computermediated discourse organised as a question-driven inquiry process. In all, 17 students participated in the discourse as part of their studies in a cognitive psychology course. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to investigate critical patterns and possible effects of the tutors ’ process-level scaffolding. During the process, the more experienced tutors acted as metalevel commentators, whereas the less-experienced tutor participated in the inquiry as a co-inquirer who also produced inquiry questions. More elaborate scaffolding to foster students ’ metacognitive awareness of the inquiry strategies was generally lacking in all three tutors ’ data. Implications for pedagogical improvement in collaborative, computer-supported educational settings are discussed. Patterns of scaffolding...|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{and other}} culture-based types of small business, {{which are the}} leitmotif in the {{planning}} of the Europark Ruardi, are becoming the guiding motif in the spatial development of urban centres that are influenced by dynamic transformation processes. The system should build upon the exploitation of both local and regional environmental features. This would encourage the quest for special environmental features, {{with an emphasis on}} their conservation, i. e. sustainable development, and connections in a wider context. The Europark is seen as a new strategic point of the Zasavje Region (the region of the central Sava Valley), which is linked to other important points in a region relevant for tourism. Due to the "smallness" of the region and/or the proximity of such points, development can be fast and effective. The interaction of different activities in space yields endless opportunities for users, who choose their own goals and priorities in the use of space. Four theme areas of the Europark area planning are envisaged. The <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> is based on the composition of the mosaic field patterns, where green fields intertwine with areas of different, existing and new, urban functions.

40|$|Projects {{to model}} {{business}} process are initiated {{for a variety}} of reasons. Some organisations initiate process modelling to solve particular problems. Other organisations make process modelling as part of their continuous improvement programme. The ISO 9000 : 2000 standard for quality management effectively mandates a process management approach for any organisations that seek the certification. Any modelling is an abstraction of the real world. Business process modelling is the abstraction of the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> in an organisation. Abstractions are influenced by the viewpoint of the modeller. The success of the modelling project is judged by how well the model satisfies the objectives of the modelling. From a business perspective, performance management provides the mechanism to set targets(key performance indicators, KPIs) for the different departments and individuals. Integrated approach to apply performance measures on business processes has been successfully applied in some organisations. An effective performance measurement system starts from the mission and vision of the organisation and designs the KPIs for each unit or process from this overall corporate goal. As a means to steer the organisation, the goal and the KPIs have to be changed to respond to the business environment. The theory of business strategy provides many approaches to help senior management to analys...|$|E
