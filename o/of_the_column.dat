5|$|During their {{approach}} to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed through a large and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> nor did he choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> cools off, {{but because of the}} narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E

5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation {{and then turned}} to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine <b>the</b> seismic {{behavior}} <b>of</b> Japanese traditional temple gates to intense earthquakes, we have conducted shaking table tests using a 1 / 3 scale model of Eiheiji-Sanmon in Fukui pref. <b>The</b> bottoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns</b> <b>of</b> this gate are not connected to the foundation. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important features of Japanese traditional wooden buildings. In additional to this, we inserted {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene between the foundation and <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation is to control low friction coefficient between the foundation and <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns.</b> As a result, it becomes possible for the upper frame to move from the foundation and reduce <b>the</b> damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper frame in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a strong earthquake. The results from the examination are as follows (1) We evaluated Vibrational Characteristics and Damping Properties by several test methods. (2) By inserting ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, the input energy was dissipated through a sliding motion between foundation and <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>columns.</b> <b>The</b> damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper frame was reduced...|$|R

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|At Reims, Julian {{showed his}} {{characteristic}} boldness by deciding, in conference with his senior commanders, {{to deal with}} the Alamanni problem at source by marching straight to Alsace and restoring Roman control of the region. On the way, however, his army was ambushed and nearly destroyed at Decem Pagi (Dieuze) by a large German band who fell on two rearguard legions which had lost contact with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> in dense mist. They were rescued by auxilia palatina regiments that heard the uproar. Proceeding to Brotomagus (Brumath) in Alsace, Julian's army routed another German band in the field.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered it strange that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight in an unfamiliar area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. His column was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, hoping it would be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column</b> by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
