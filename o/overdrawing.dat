25|$|The Tuvalu Trust Fund was {{established}} with a management structure {{that was designed}} to avoid the mismanagement and corruption that has plagued many other Pacific trust funds. One important element of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is that it is structured to avoid <b>overdrawing</b> to fund unauthorised projects. This is achieved through the separation of fund capital from fund proceeds available for distribution. The success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is attributed by Brian Bell to the following factors: Accountability through a Board of four directors with Tuvalu in the chair and the other original parties providing members; the use of Professional funds management to provide investment advice; the monitoring of the performance of the fund by actuarial consultants (the Fund Monitor); the auditing of the fund by international auditors; and an advisory committee to monitor Tuvalu's economic performance and provide advice to the Government and the Board.|$|E
25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style beaded and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as <b>overdrawing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : Illustration of <b>overdraw</b> and vertex cache efficiency. In {{the front}} views, darker regions {{represent}} high-overdraw. In the side views, darker regions represent cache misses. (a) Rendering triangles in a front-to-back order maximizes {{the use of}} early Z-culling, but results in poor vertex cache performance. (b) Conversely, mesh locality optimizations produce excellent cache hit rates but can generate high levels of <b>overdraw.</b> (c) Our method combines both ideas into a view-independent ordering that results in excellent cache performance while minimizing <b>overdraw.</b> We describe an automatic preprocessing algorithm that reorders triangles in a mesh so as to enable the graphics hardware to efficiently cull vertex and pixel processing at rendering time. Our method starts by dividing the mesh into planar clusters which are subsequently sorted into a view-independent order which greatly reduces <b>overdraw.</b> The result {{is an increase in}} the opportunities for early Z-culling, reducing pixel processing time. The clusters are then optimized for mes...|$|R
40|$|Vertex cache {{efficiency}} and <b>overdraw.</b> Views of a 40 k triangle Dragon model are shown, where red regions represent cache misses, and dark regions represent high <b>overdraw</b> rate. As a preprocessing stage, real-time rendering applications optimize the order triangles are issued {{to reduce the}} average posttransform vertex cache miss ratio (ACMR) (a-c). Recent algorithms also minimize the <b>overdraw</b> ratios (OVR) (d-e) with little cache degradation. We present novel algorithms that result in excellent vertex cache efficiency (c) as well as low <b>overdraw</b> (e). Our methods are significantly faster than previous approaches (compare timings), and are suitable for run-time execution. We present novel algorithms that optimize {{the order in which}} triangles are rendered, to improve post-transform vertex cache efficiency as well as for view-independent <b>overdraw</b> reduction. The resulting triangle orders perform on par with previous methods, but are orders magnitude faster to compute. The improvements in processing speed allow us to perform the optimization right after a model is loaded, when more information on the host hardware is available. This allows our vertex cache optimization to often outperform other methods. In fact, our algorithms can even be executed interactively, allowing for re-optimization in case of changes to geometry or topology, which happen often in CAD/CAM applications. We believe that most real-time rendering applications will immediately benefit from these new results. ...|$|R

2500|$|Also of {{interest}} is that on the last page of the MS are found numerous small pencil drawings of horses, lambs, lions and two human profiles. Additionally, the word [...] "Numeration" [...] has been written in {{the centre of the}} page, the word [...] "Lamb" [...] in tiny script between the two human profiles (partly obscured by a large [...] "N"), and two signatures of Blake himself {{at the top of the}} page. Also present are various random letters (especially the letter [...] "N") which may be examples of Blake's attempts to master mirror writing, a skill which was necessary for his work as an engraver. However, it is thought that at least some of the sketches and lettering on this page could have been by Blake's brother, Robert; [...] "the awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry of the head of the large lion in the lower pair of animals in the upper left quadrant of the page, and the heavy <b>overdrawing</b> on some of the other animals are among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many were {{critical}} about Duffy's {{voice on the}} record. John Bush of Allmusic said that [...] "Duffy's voice [...] has not improved with age, or simply isn't portrayed well here." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that it is [...] "clearly not her most potent weapon", criticising her choice to [...] "build an album out of it." [...] Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the bigger problem with Endlessly is that Duffy compensates for her lack of a star persona by <b>overdrawing</b> her syrupy rasp, already noted for its acquired tastiness, into a cartoonish oddity." [...] Spin noted that ultimately, it's the vocals that carry Endlessly. There's no whitewashing of the singer's eccentricities, which feel more pronounced here—she can be gruffly nasal (the oft-repeated chorus of [...] "Well, Well, Well" [...] never stops sounding like [...] "whale, whale, whale") while remaining wholly beguiling." [...] However, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly and Will Dean of The Guardian were more complementary, with Dean calling it [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] and Rosen applauding it for being [...] "smoky and touched with grit." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times said that her voice is [...] "delicious to some and cloying to others." [...] Duffy was compared to several female pop singers such as Kylie Minogue, Debbie Harry of Blondie and Madonna.|$|E

Then he paid for his passage from Liverpool to New York under the name of Walter Jones, and felt as he did so that the intrigue was becoming very deep. This was on Tuesday. He dined again at the club, alone, and in the evening went to the Music Hall. There he remained, from ten till nearly twelve, very angry at the non-appearance of Ruby Ruggles. As he smoked and drank in solitude, he almost made up his mind that he had intended to tell her of his departure for New York. Of course he would have done no such thing. But now, should she ever complain on that head he would have his answer ready. He had devoted his last night in England to the purpose of telling her, and she had broken her appointment. Everything would now be her fault. Whatever might happen to her she could not blame him.|$|E
