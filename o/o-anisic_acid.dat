40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{vibrational}} spectroscopy of <b>O-Anisic</b> <b>acid</b> (OAA) and Anisic acid (AA). The fundamental vibrational frequencies and intensity of vibrational bands were evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) with standard B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G** method and basis set combinations. The vibrational spectra were interpreted, {{with the aid of}} normal coordinate analysis based on a scaled quantum mechanical force field. The infrared and Raman spectra were also predicted from the calculated intensities. The effects of carbonyl and methyl substitutions on the structure and vibrational frequencies have been investigated. Comparison of simulated spectra with the experimental spectra provides important information about the ability of the computational method to describe the vibrational modes. The 13 C and 1 H NMR chemical shifts of the DFA and CA molecules were calculated using the gauge-invariant-atomic orbital (GIAO) method in DMSO solution using IEF-PCM model and compared with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Anacardic acid {{derivatives}} {{exhibit a}} broad range of biological activities. In this report, an efficient method for the synthesis of anacardic acid derivatives was explored, and a small set of salicylic acid variants synthesised retaining a constant hydrophobic element (a naphthyl tail). The naphthyl side chain was introduced via Wittig reaction and the aldehyde installed using directed ortho-metalation reaction of the substituted <b>o-anisic</b> <b>acids.</b> The failure of ortho-metalation using unprotected carboxylic acid group compelled us to use directed ortho-metalation in which a tertiary amide was used as a strong ortho-directing group. In the initial route, tertiary amide cleavage during final step was challenging, but cleaving the tertiary amide before Wittig reaction was beneficial. The Wittig reaction with protected carboxylic group (methyl ester) resulted in side-products whereas using sodium salt resulted in higher yields. The novel compounds were screened for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. Although substitution on the salicylic head group enhanced antibacterial activities they also enhanced cytotoxicity...|$|R
