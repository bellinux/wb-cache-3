This coating is used to lubricate <b>Oil-Free</b> Foil <b>Air</b> Bearings as they experience friction and wear during start up and shut down. The coating deposition process begins with undercutting the shaft. This area is then sandblasted to provide a rough surface for the coating to adhere to.

The coating is then ground down even with the surface of the shaft and gets a nice polished finish. The foil air bearings use the solid lubricant, as mentioned above, during start up and shut down. During normal operating conditions, generally above 2000 RPM, the bearings utilize air as their lubricant. Foil air bearings are comprised of a thin top foil and a corrugated bump foil. They have an interference fit with the shaft before operation. As the air gets "trapped" between the top foil and the shaft, it presses the top foil against the bump foil, in turn compressing the bumps. As the bumps compress, it allows for the air to separate the top foil from the shaft, therefore, utilizing the trapped air as its lubricant...|$|R

40|$|Relative {{humidity}} of air {{produced by}} simple compressors {{used to drive}} ventilators was measured at different working pressures. At normal working pressures, a relative humidity of 100 % was found and condensation occurred, mainly at the high pressure air/oxygen mixer valve. This resulted in blockages and loss of accuracy which could have serious consequences for patients. It was concluded that simple compressors are unsuitable and that medical air must be used. The Siemens Servo- 900 B ventilator is driven by gas derived from a high pressure air/oxygen mixer unit and requires a minimum operating pressure of 200 kPa. When medical air is not available, the ventilators are supplied with compressors which are of the reciprocating piston, <b>oil-free</b> type, without <b>air</b> drying facilities but fitted with cooling coils.

40|$|A {{new test}} rig has been {{developed}} for simulating high-speed turbomachinery shafting using <b>Oil-Free</b> foil <b>air</b> bearing technology. Foil air journal bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings with a flexible inner sleeve surface using air as the lubricant. These bearings {{have been used in}} turbomachinery, primarily air cycle machines, for the past four decades to eliminate the need for oil lubrication. More recently, interest has been growing in applying foil bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines. They offer potential improvements in efficiency and power density, decreased maintenance costs, and other secondary benefits. The goal of applying foil air bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines prompted the fabrication of this test rig. The facility enables bearing designers to test potential bearing designs with shafts that simulate the rotating components of a target engine without the high cost of building actual flight hardware. The data collected from this rig {{can be used to make}} changes to the shaft and bearings in subsequent design iterations. The rest of this article describes the new test rig and demonstrates some of its capabilities with an initial simulated shaft system. The test rig has two support structures, each housing a foil air journal bearing. The structures are designed to accept any size foil journal bearing smaller than 63 mm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. The bearing support structures are mounted to a 91 - by 152 -cm (3 - by 5 -ft) table and can be separated by as much as 122 cm (4 ft) and as little as 20 cm (8 in.) to accommodate a wide range of shaft sizes. In the initial configuration, a 9. 5 -cm (3. 75 -in.) impulse air turbine drives the test shaft. The impulse turbine, as well as virtually any number of "dummy" compressor and turbine disks, can be mounted on the shaft inboard or outboard of the bearings. This flexibility allows researchers to simulate various engine shaft configurations. The bearing support structures include a unique bearing mounting fixture that rotates to accommodate a laserbased alignment system. This can measure the misalignment of the bearing centers in each of 2 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom. In the initial configuration, with roughly a 30. 5 -cm- (12 -in. -) long shaft, two simulated aerocomponent disks, and two 50. 8 -cm (2 -in.) foil journal bearings, the rig can operate at 65, 000 rpm at room temperature. The test facility can measure shaft displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions at each bearing location. Horizontal and vertical structural vibrations are monitored using accelerometers mounted on the bearing support structures. This information is used to determine system rotordynamic response, including critical speeds, mode shapes, orbit size and shape, and potentially the onset of instabilities. Bearing torque can be monitored as well to predict the power loss in the foil bearings. All of this information is fed back and forth between NASA and the foil bearing designers in an iterative fashion to converge on a final bearing and shaft design for a given engine application. In addition to its application development capabilities, the test rig offers several unique capabilities for basic bearing research. Using the laser alignment system mentioned earlier, the facility will be used to map foil air journal bearing performance. A known misalignment of increasing severity will be induced to determine the sensitivity of foil bearings to misalignment. Other future plans include oil-free integral starter generator testing and development, and dynamic load testing of foil journal bearings...|$|R

In order to better understand the processes involved in the investigated compressor, a comprehensive mathematical model has been developed. The model uses derived analytic equations for the geometry with application {{to a wide range of}} compressor designs stemming from various involute curves. The geometry has been numerically validated for accuracy and includes volume, surface area and centroid locations for the compression pockets, as well as wall length and thickness for variably wall scroll compressors. Differential equations governing the temperature and specific volume of the pockets have been derived as well as relations for resulting forces and overturning moments. An adaptive RK 4 solver has been implemented to solve the system of equations. The compressor model has been validated against experimental data for the investigated compressor and a parametric study has been performed. Different wrap combinations as well as discharge port locations have been studied for the investigated compressor. In addition, how variable wall thickness can impact various aspects of compressor leakage has been investigated. With results from the parametric study a new compressor concept has been designed and built from both plastic and metallic materials. Performance test have been conducted on the compressor concept and comparison between plastic and metallic compressor performance have been made. Final model validation with use of plastic has been performed. ...|$|E
40|$|A bulk-flow {{analysis}} and computer program for prediction of the static load performance and dynamic force coefficients of angled injection, orifice-compensated hydrostatic/hydrodynamic thrust bearings have been completed. The {{product of the}} research is an efficient computational tool {{for the design of}} high-speed thrust bearings for cryogenic fluid turbopumps. The study addresses the needs of a growing technology that requires of reliable fluid film bearings to provide the maximum operating life with optimum controllable rotordynamic characteristics at the lowest cost. The motion of a cryogenic fluid on the thin film lands of a thrust bearing is governed by a set of bulk-flow mass and momentum conservation and energy transport equations. Mass flow conservation and a simple model for momentum transport within the hydrostatic bearing recesses are also accounted for. The bulk-flow model includes flow turbulence with fluid inertia advection, Coriolis and centrifugal acceleration effects on the bearing recesses and film lands. The cryogenic fluid properties are obtained from realistic thermophysical equations of state. Turbulent bulk-flow shear parameters are based on Hirs' model with Moody's friction factor equations allowing a simple simulation for machined bearing surface roughness. A perturbation analysis leads to zeroth-order nonlinear equations governing the fluid flow for the thrust bearing operating at a static equilibrium position, and first-order linear equations describing the perturbed fluid flow for small amplitude shaft motions in the axial direction. Numerical solution to the zeroth-order flow field equations renders the bearing flow rate, thrust load, drag torque and power dissipation. Solution to the first-order equations determines the axial stiffness, damping and inertia force coefficients. The computational method uses well established algorithms and generic subprograms available from prior developments. The Fortran 9 O computer program hydrothrust runs on a Windows 95 /NT personal computer. The program, help files and examples are licensed by Texas A&M University Technology License Office. The study of the static and dynamic performance of two hydrostatic/hydrodynamic bearings demonstrates the importance of centrifugal and advection fluid inertia effects for operation at high rotational speeds. The first example considers a conceptual hydrostatic thrust bearing for an advanced liquid hydrogen turbopump operating at 170, 000 rpm. The large axial stiffness and damping coefficients of the bearing should provide accurate control and axial positioning of the turbopump and also allow for unshrouded impellers, therefore increasing the overall pump efficiency. The second bearing uses a refrigerant R 134 a, and its application in <b>oil-free</b> <b>air</b> conditioning compressors is of great technological importance and commercial value. The computed predictions reveal that the LH 2 bearing load capacity and flow rate increase with the recess pressure (i. e. increasing orifice diameters). The bearing axial stiffness has a maximum for a recess pressure rati of approx. 0. 55. while the axial damping coefficient decreases as the recess pressure ratio increases. The computer results from three flow models are compared. These models are a) inertialess, b) fluid inertia at recess edges only, and c) full fluid inertia at both recess edges and film lands. The full inertia model shows the lowest flow rates, axial load capacity and stiffness coefficient {{but on the other hand}} renders the largest damping coefficients and inertia coefficients. The most important findings are related to the reduction of the outflow through the inner radius and the appearance of subambient pressures. The performance of the refrigerant hybrid thrust bearing is evaluated at two operating speeds and pressure drops. The computed results are presented in dimensionless form to evidence consistent trends in the bearing performance characteristics. As the applied axial load increases, the bearing film thickness and flow rate decrease while the recess pressure increases. The axial stiffness coefficient shows a maximum for a certain intermediate load while the damping coefficient steadily increases. The computed results evidence the paramount of centrifugal fluid inertia at low recess pressures (i. e. low loads), and where there is actually an inflow through the bearing inner diameter, accompanied by subambient pressures just downstream of the bearing recess edge. These results are solely due to centrifugal fluid inertia and advection transport effects. Recommendations include the extension of the computer program to handle flexure pivot tilting pad hybrid bearings and the ability to calculate moment coefficients for shaft angular misalignments...|$|E
