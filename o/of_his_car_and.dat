5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook additional testing at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, testing new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch and Montoya {{moved into}} fourth and ninth {{positions}} respectively on lap 141. By the 150th lap, Johnson {{had built up}} a 2.7 second lead over Hamlin. On lap 162, Johnson's lead of 3.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when debris was spotted on the track, causing a caution. During the caution, some of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Johnson remained the leader on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Hamlin. Two laps later, a multi-car collision occurred on the front straightway as Earnhardt lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> collected Logano, Scott Speed, Hornish, Bobby Labonte, Kenseth, Stewart, Vickers and Keselowski. The damaged cars headed to the pit road during the caution as crews cleaned up debris.|$|E

He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home.

At the very first World Championship event, the 1950 British Grand Prix, the Gerard-R14B pairing only narrowly missed out on the points, finishing in sixth place, despite having started as low as 13th on the grid. He also finished in sixth in R4A at the Monaco event later in the season, this time from 16th at the start.|$|R

5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E
5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> struck the Royale RP11.

Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow his car {{to be removed from}} the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E
5|$|On race day, a 30-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{before the event}} began; Kanaan again posted the fastest time (35.288), {{followed}} by Zanardi and Paul Tracy.

They remained the top two in lap 20, with Dario Franchitti in third. Six laps later, Andretti passed Franchitti to reclaim second when the latter was unable to pass a slower car. Drivers near the lead begin making their first round of pit stops on lap 35, and continued doing so through lap 40. By lap 60, Bräck had built a lead of more than seven seconds. Carpentier had moved into second place, and Andretti, Tagliani, and Franchitti rounded out the top five. Bräck relinquished his lead on lap 64, when he went off course while attempting to lap Junqueira. The first caution flag of the day came out, but not before Carpentier took the lead as Bräck regained control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> re-entered the track in second place. Pit stops took place during the caution, with Carpentier, Bräck, and Andretti still in the top three positions.|$|E

Irvine, Alexander Wurz and Villeneuve completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Ferraris outpaced the other teams in the first session on a dusty track surrounded by the sand dune desert of Sakhir. Massa's time of 1:32.233 was quicker than Räikkönen's, who was slowed down by an early excursion across the sand, requiring a pit stop. Nico Rosberg of Williams, Hamilton, McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima and Kubica rounded out the top seven. In the second session, Hamilton lost control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> slid sideways into a wall. Hamilton emerged unharmed from the collision, but his McLaren suffered significant damage. Except for the crash, the second session ended like the first: once again, Massa led Räikkönen to Ferrari 1–2, ahead of Kovalainen, Hamilton and Kubica. The third session was again held on a dusty track, where Rosberg was quickest {{with a time of}} 1:32.521. Massa took second, ahead of Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Toyota driver Jarno Trulli, David Coulthard of Red Bull, Nakajima and Kubica. Räikkönen was ninth quickest, and Hamilton 18th.|$|E

He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear.

5|$|Vandoorne {{remained}} with his intended strategy {{and led the}} field back up to speed at the lap-nine restart, ahead of Haryanto and Leal. He fended off an attempted overtake by Haryanto heading into the first corner, while Leal fell to fifth after he was passed by Matsushita and Visoiu. While in traffic, Lynn attempted to pass Rossi heading into the first turn, but made contact with the rear-end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> sustained front wing damage. Rossi pushed hard and moved ahead of Amberg by the twelfth lap. He caught up to Stanaway and quickly overtook him, and passed Berthon {{with the use of}} DRS two laps later. Rossi made further use of the system to get ahead of de Jong and Markelov. It allowed him to build a large gap to Lynn who was struggling. Rossi overtook Leal to move into fifth on lap 15, and the drivers who were running {{in the middle of the}} field made their mandatory tyre pit stops. Evans overtook Lynn driving into turn one on the 18th lap. Lynn reported that his car had tyre degradation problems and dropped down the running order, while cars who conserved their tyres took advantage.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
