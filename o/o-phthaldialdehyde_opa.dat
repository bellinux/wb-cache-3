40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a simple, accurate and multi-sample method for {{the determination of}} proline in wines thanks to a 96 -well microplate technique. Praline is the most abundant amino acid in wine and is an important parameter related to wine characteristics or maturation processes of grape. In the current study, an improved application of the general method based on sodium hypochlorite oxidation and <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> -thiol spectrofluorometric detection is described. The main interfering compounds for specific proline detection in wines are strongly reduced by selective reaction with OPA in a preliminary step under well-defined pH conditions. Application of the protocol after a 500 -fold dilution of wine samples provides a working range between 0. 02 and 2. 90 g L- 1, with a limit of detection of 7. 50 mg L- 1. Comparison and validation on real wine samples by ion-exchange chromatography prove that this procedure yields accurate results. Simplicity of the protocol used, with no need for centrifugation or filtration, organic solvents or high temperature enables its full implementation in plastic microplates and efficient application for routine analysis of proline in wines.

40|$|Abstract: The meat portion {{directly}} {{attached to}} bovine hides (fleshing meat) is {{a by-product of}} leather industry that is a potential new source of proteins. In literature different enzymatic and chemical methods have been proposed to hydrolyze and solubilize fleshing meat. Enzyme hydrolysis is preferable for the mildness and the lower environmental impact. Enzymatic hydrolysates have never been deeply characterized, nor the specific enzyme efficiency, deeply investigated. In this study, the activity of six proteolytic enzymes was tested {{in order to determine}} their efficiency in solubilizing fleshing meat and to characterize at the molecular level the composition of the nitrogen fraction of the obtained hydrolysates. Total nitrogen content and the degree of hydrolysis were determined by Kjeldhal and <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> methods. Amino acids and peptides were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed that papain and Alcalase appear to be the most efficient enzymes, and the corresponding hydrolyzates were rich in peptides and amino acids characteristic of collagen, notably absent in the hydrolyzates obtained with other enzymes. Thus, the ability to efficiently hydrolyze collagen seems {{to be related to the}} efficiency in fleshing meat hydrolysis. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext. ]</p...|$|E

40|$|The {{immobilisation}} of bio-receptors on transducer surfaces {{is a key}} step in {{the development}} of biosensors. The immobilisation needs to be fast, cheap and most importantly should not affect the biorecognition activity of the immobilised receptor. The development of a protocol for biomolecule immobilisation onto a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface using inexpensive polythiol compounds is presented here. The method used here is based on the reaction between primary amines and thioacetal groups, formed upon reaction of <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> and thiol compounds. The self-assembled thiol monolayers were characterised using contact angle and XPS. The possibility to immobilise proteins on monolayers was assessed by employing BSA as a model protein. For the polythiol layers exhibiting the best performance, a general protocol was optimised suitable for the immobilisation of enzymes and antibodies such as anti-prostate specific antigen (anti-PSA) and anti Salmonella typhimurium. The kinetic data was obtained for PSA binding to anti-PSA and for S. typhimurium cells with a detection limit of 5 x 10 (6) cells mL(- 1) with minimal non-specific binding of other biomolecules. These findings make this technique a very promising alternative for amine coupling compared to peptide bond formation.

Methods: Amino acids of pharmacopuncture extracted from S. subspinipes mutilans were derived by using <b>O-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> & 9 -fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl chloride (FMOC) reagent and were analyzed using HPLC. The amino acids were detected by using a diode array detector (DAD) and a fluorescence detector (FLD) to compare a mixed amino acid standard (STD) to the pharmacopuncture from centipedes. The stability tests on the pharmacopuncture from centipedes were done using HPLC for three conditions: a room temperature test chamber, an acceleration test chamber, and a cold test chamber.

A procedure using an activating reagent of the carboxylic function (water-soluble carbodiimide EDC) and a fluorescent amino labeling reagent (N-(1 -naphthyl) ethylenediamine, EDAN) allows {{the formation of an}} isoindole derivative that needs to be separated from initial fluorescent amine for efficient VFAs determination. Isolation of these fluorescent VFA-derivatives was carried out by use of the fluorescent quenching of EDAN with <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA).</b> Quenching was most efficient at pH around 7 and by heating at 40 degrees C within the microplate reader. This optimized procedure has been applied to various carboxylic acids and other organic compounds, demonstrating that VFA exhibit the highest fluorescence responses with homogeneous results for the main ones (acetic, propionic and butyric acid, all mass concentration expressed as acetic acid equivalents). This protocol was calibrated against acetic acid and determination of VFA was thus possible in the range 3. 9 - 2000 mg L- 1 (acetic acid equivalents). Subsequent application to real samples (sewage sludges or anaerobically digested samples) and comparison to gas chromatography analyses gave accurate results, proving the great potential of our high-throughput microplate-based technique for the analysis of VFA.

40|$|Hydroxyacetone (HA) {{is mainly}} {{produced}} in the atmosphere from oxidation of hydrocarbons of the type, CH{sub 3 }(R) C{double{underscore}bond}CH{sub 2 }. Tuazon and Atkinson (1990) reported HA yield of 41 % from the OH-initiated oxidation of methacrolein {{in the presence of}} NOx. Since methacrolein is a major product of isoprene oxidation (Carter and Atkinson, 1996), isoprene, a key biogenic hydrocarbon, is therefore expected to be an important source for HA. Consequently, knowledge of ambient concentration of HA would provide information needed to examine the applicability of isoprene reaction mechanisms developed in laboratory and to assess the contribution of isoprene to photooxidant production. The commonly used GC-FID technique involving cryo-focusing is unsuitable for HA owing to HA's thermal instability. When subjected to a temperature of 100 C for only a few seconds, HA was found to disappear completely. Since HA is highly soluble in water, the authors developed a wet chemical technique similar in principle to the one they reported earlier, namely, derivatization following liquid scrubbing.

The limit of quantification for this method is 0. 2 mg/kg, which is very sensitive for histamine determination. With the "sandwich" injection program, 3. 7 % of relative standard deviation (RSD) was achieved by five replicative determinations of a sample blank spiked with 0. 25 mg/kg histamine standard. Histamine in food samples such as fumitory skipjack and mackerel was analyzed with relative recoveries over 95 % at spiking level of 150 mg/kg, as well as canned tuna fish and cheese with relative recoveries up to 98 % at spiking levels of 0. 50 and 5. 0 mg/kg, respectively. The proposed method was validated with a sample from the Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme (FAPAS) as a standard certified material; and the results (140 +/- 6 mg/kg) agreed well with the assigned value (139 mg/kg).

40|$|Dissolved free {{amino acids}} (DFAA) in {{seawater}} are a form of nitrogen (N) available for marine microbes. In oligotrophic environments where N-containing nutrients are the limiting factor for microbial growth, N nutrition from DFAA could be crucial, but as yet it is poorly resolved. Measurements of individual DFAA are challenging as concentrations are typically in the low nmol L− 1 range. Here we report modifications to methodology using <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> derivatization and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) that provide a 30 -fold improvement in sensitivity enabling the detection of 15 amino acids in seawater with a limit of detection as low as 10 pmol L− 1 with accuracy and precision of better than 10 %. This analytical methodology is now suitable for the challenging quantitation of DFAA in oligotrophic seawaters. The method was successfully applied to a suite of seawater samples collected on a cruise crossing the South Atlantic Ocean, where concentrations of DFAAs were generally low (sub nmol L− 1), revealing basin-scale features in the oceanographic distributions of DFAA. This unique dataset implies that DFAAs are {{an important component of}} the N cycle in both near-coastal and open oceans. Further calculations suggest that the proportions of organic N originating from DFAA sources were significant, contributing between 0. 2 and 200 % that of NH 4 + and up to 77 % that of total inorganic nitrogen in the upper 400 m in some regions of the transect...|$|E
40|$|Heat effects induced {{during the}} storage of enteral formula under {{laboratory}} and industrial conditions were evaluated using the following indicators: furosine; loss of available amino groups, measured by decrease in <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> reactivity; fluorescence associated with the Maillard reaction (345 nm excitation, 415 nm emission); and colour (absorbance at 420 nm). The storage of formulas A and B (with different protein content) at 4, 20 and 30 °C during 12, 24 and 36 weeks produced an increase in furosine values. Under industrial storage conditions at 55 °C for between 1 and 12 weeks the behaviour of furosine differed between {{the two types of}} formulas. In Formula A (lesser protein content), there was a decrease in furosine level after the third week, whereas in formula B (greater protein content) a decrease was observed after the eighth week. The loss of OPA reactivity reached 18 % and 22 %, respectively, for formula B and formula A stored at 30 °C for 36 weeks. In adverse storage conditions (55 °C), the loss of OPA reactivity reached 50 %. Fluorescence intensity (FI) and absorbance at 420 nm increased at all time/temperatures assayed. It reached values of 22. 5 and 27. 5 for FI and 0. 161 and 0. 173 for A 420, respectively, for formula A and B, stored for 36 weeks at 30 °C. Furosine, loss of OPA reactivity, fluorescence intensity and colour are useful indicators of nonenzymatic browning during storage of enteral formulas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractChal is a {{traditional}} fermented product produced from spontaneously fermented camel milk which contains several bacterial species with potential usage in producing traditional dairy products and functional foods. The aims {{of this study were}} to isolate and identify predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from Chal and investigate antioxidant activity of camel and bovine milk fermented by these isolates. Chal samples were collected from Turkman Sahra, Golestan Province, Iran. The protein hydrolysis was determined by <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> method, and antioxidant activities of whey fractions were evaluated by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals scavenging methods. Nine catalase-negative bacteria including Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. kefiri, L. gasseri, L. paracasei, Leuconostoc (Leu.) lactis, Weissella (W.) cibaria, and Enterococcus (E.) faecium were isolated and identified by conventional and molecular methods. Both camel and bovine milk were fermented by the strains for 24  h. Fermented camel milk showed significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) higher antioxidant activity than bovine milk. Camel milk fermented by Leu. lactis showed significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) higher DPPH (57. 90 [*]±[*] 4. 59  μM) and ABTS (1484. 35 [*]±[*] 128. 20  μM; P[*]<[*] 0. 05) radical scavenging activity compared to samples fermented by other strains. According to sensory evaluation of fermented camel and bovine milks, camel milk fermented by Leu. lactis SM 10 had the highest overall acceptance values. Our findings suggest that camel and bovine milk fermented by LAB isolated from Chal could potentially be used for producing novel functional foods...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures {{from the}} collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the fermentation of caseins, a-lactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially b-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially b-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l 598, Streptococcus thermophilus t 3 D 1, Dt 1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b 38, b 122 and b 24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat’s milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to adopt a reverse flow {{injection}} analysis (rFIA) technique to the fluorometric analysis of the reaction <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> with ammonium, allowing accurate measurements of ammonium concentrations lower than the detection limit of the widely used indophenol blue (IPB) colorimetric method while accounting for the background fluorescence of seawater. Ammonium is considered an essential nutrient for primary productivity, especially in the nutrient depleted surface ocean where as the most reduced form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, it is readily assimilated via metabolic pathways. Challenges in the quantification of ammonium require more sensitive analytical techniques for {{a greater understanding of}} the biogeochemical cycling of ammonium in the oligotrophic ocean. On-line and automated flow analysis techniques are capable of mitigating some of the challenges. Fluorescent-based methods out-perform colorimetric methods in terms of detection limits and sensitivity. Presented here is the development of an rFIA technique paired with an OPA-sulfite chemistry. For this method, a sulfite-formaldehyde reagent is mixed with the sample stream and then injected with the OPA reagent before being heated. Fluorescence is measured before and {{at the peak of the}} OPA injection, differentiating the background fluorescence from the analyte signal. Experiments to optimize reaction parameters and characterize the effects of salinity and potentially interfering species were conducted. The newly developed method offers a reasonable throughput (18 samples per hour), low limit of detection (1. 1 nM) ammonium analysis technique with automatic background fluorescence correction suitable for oligotrophic seawater as a preferable alternative to the low sensitivity and high limit of detection IPB colorimetric method...|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} {{solid-phase}} extraction (SPE) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) {{for the analysis}} of tobramycin in human serum is presented. An off-line SPE employing a carboxypropyl bonded phase (CBA) cartridge was used for the extraction of tobramycin from human serum. Adsorbed tobramycin was eluted from the CBA cartridge using a mixture of NH(3) (25 %, w/v) -methanol (30 : 70, v/v). After evaporation, the analyte was reconstituted and derivatized with <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA)</b> / 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The resulting tobramycin-OPA/MPA derivative was purified, and then identified by mass spectrometry. The tobramycin-OPA/MPA derivative was then analysed by CZE with a background electrolyte (BGE) comprising of 30 mM sodium tetraborate pH 10. 0 -acetonitrile (ACN) (80 : 20, v/v) with ultraviolet detection at 230 nm. A linear response was observed in the range of 0. 3 - 30 microg/ml with r(2) = 0. 992. The sensitivity of the method was determined by its limit of quantitation (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 3 microg/ml and 0. 1 microg/ml, respectively. SPE recovery ranged from 68 to 79 % at the trough levels to 98 % at the peak levels found in serum. Furosemide has been added as internal standard (IS) to improve precision. For the therapeutic range of tobramycin in serum (2 - 10 microg/ml) the relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) was less than 11 % for the entire SPE/CE process. The method demonstrated excellent selectivity as shown by the lack of interference from a total of 20 drugs investigated. The method was then used in therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving the drug. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are {{the main}} neurotransmitters in {{the central nervous system}} for {{excitatory}} and inhibitory processes, respectively. Monitoring these neurotransmitters is an essential tool in establishing pathological functions, among others in terms of occupational exposure to toxic substances. Material and Methods: We present modification of the HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) to the UPLC (ultra-performance liquid chromatography) method for the simultaneous determination of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid in a single injection. The isocratic separation of these neurotransmitter derivatives was performed on Waters Acquity BEH (ethylene bridged hybrid) C 18 column with particle size of 1. 7 μm at 35 °C using a mobile phase consisting of 0. 1 M acetate buffer (pH 6. 0) and methanol (60 : 40, v/v) at a flow rate of 0. 3 ml/min. The analytes were detected with the fluorescence detector (FLD) using derivatization with <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> (<b>OPA),</b> resulting in excitation at 340 nm and emission at 455 nm. Results: Several validation parameters including linearity (0. 999), accuracy (101. 1 %), intra-day precision (1. 52 – 1. 84 %), inter-day precision (2. 47 – 3. 12 %), limit of detection (5 – 30 ng/ml) and quantification (100 ng/ml) were examined. The developed method was also used for the determination of these neurotransmitters in homogenates of selected rat brain structures. Conclusions: The presented UPLC-FLD is characterized by shorter separation time (3. 5 min), which is an adaptation of the similar HPLC methods and is an alternative for more expensive references techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods.
