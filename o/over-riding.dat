40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea well, the workover riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A safety joint {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the Telescopic Safety Joint (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the emergency disconnect function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The safety joint is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the safety joint may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an <b>over-ride</b> function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The <b>over-ride</b> function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the <b>over-ride</b> function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the <b>over-ride</b> function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function to a semi-pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function. The joint using the full capacity of the <b>over-ride</b> function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized <b>over-ride</b> function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The <b>over-ride</b> function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the <b>over-ride</b> function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd riser joint, the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full <b>over-ride</b> capacity is used. The <b>over-ride</b> functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the safety joint and thus the safety joint would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the <b>over-ride</b> function is active...|$|R

York later became the diocesan city partly because it had already been designated as such in the earlier Roman-sponsored mission of Paulinus to Deira, so {{it is not clear whether}} Bede is simply echoing the practice of his own day, or whether Oswiu and Chad were considering a territorial basis and a see for his episcopate. It is quite clear that Oswiu intended Chad to be bishop over the entire Northumbrian people, <b>over-riding</b> the claims of both Wilfrid and Eata.|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} {{there is no}} clear {{majority}} in either element or quality to give a clear signature. In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart (alternatively, the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included). Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality. So for example, if the Sun is in Taurus, its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign. If Venus is in, say, Pisces, then an additional 'casting vote' is given to the element water and quality mutable. This is usually enough to provide a signature. A 'casting vote' is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart. The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers who use it as frequently having an <b>over-riding</b> influence in the natal chart, irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism <b>over-riding</b> merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the only right answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E

500|$|The {{subject matter}} of the carvings of the central {{brackets}} as misericords is very varied, but with many common themes recurring in different churches. Typically, the themes are less unified and less directly related to the Bible and Christian theology than are the themes of small sculptures seen elsewhere within churches, such as those on bosses. This is much the case at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is directly based on a Bible story. The subjects, chosen either by the woodcarver, or perhaps by the individual paying for the stall, have no <b>over-riding</b> theme. The sole unifying element is the roundels {{on each side of the}} pictorial subject, which are all elaborately carved foliage, in most cases formal and stylised in the later Decorated manner, but with several examples of naturalistic foliage, including roses and bindweed. Many of the subjects carry traditional interpretations. The image of the [...] "Pelican in her Piety" [...] (believed to feed her young on her own blood) is a recognised symbol for Christ's love for the Church. A cat playing with a mouse may represent the Devil snaring a human soul. Other subjects illustrate popular fables or sayings such as [...] "When the fox preaches, look to your geese".
