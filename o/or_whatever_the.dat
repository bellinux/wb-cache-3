40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this review essay on {{international}} policy-related English language literature on adult education from the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s, the following models of recent adult education policy options, aiming at social change and redistribution of power under varying conjunctures, have been constructed from the literature available: the revolutionary/transformational model, the humanist model, the rationalist economic model, the post-industrial society model, the new social movement model, and the welfare state model. These models are not exclusive-there may be others-nor are they to be forced into a chronological order. However, they may occur in an interconnected as well as in a dialectic sequence. Choice or application of any or a combination of these models have not brought about redistribution of knowledge <b>or</b> power. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> philosophy, individualist <b>or</b> collective; <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> approach, selective <b>or</b> campaign; <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> economy, free market <b>or</b> centrally controlled; <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> political system, capitalist <b>or</b> socialist; <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> geographical region, developing <b>or</b> industrialized; indeed, <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> conditions, the forces resisting an enduring redistributive effect seem to have capacities to reestablish or even reinforce hierarchies challenged by attempts at transformation.

25|$|The {{island has}} more than 360 churches and chapels.

The oldest existing ecclesiastical structure is the basilica of Agios Athanasios, built in the 11th century and located in the Kastro area. All except one of the churches on the island observe the Greek Orthodox faith. The remaining church hosts a small enclave of Jehovah's Witnesses. Christianity was formalized in Skopelos by the appointment of the Bishop Riginos in the 4th century. Under the Reign of the Emperor Julian the Apostate, Riginos was martyred in 362 AD. The saint's feast day is February 25 —- a holiday on the island.|$|E
25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat <b>or</b> <b>whatever.</b> <b>The</b> only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E

Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name [...] "Springfield" [...] is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best. He [...] "figured out that Springfield {{was one of the most}} common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do." [...] An astronomer and fan of the show, Phil Plait, humorously noticed that The Simpsons could be set in Australia, because the moon in Springfield faces the wrong way to be an American location.|$|E

It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way. Whenever you look at a certain star sign you find a limited number of elements with different intervals.
