5|$|Taraki {{could count}} on the support of four {{prominent}} army officers in his struggle against Amin: Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy, Sherjan Mazdoryar and Assadullah Sarwari. These men had joined the PDPA not because of ideological reasons, but instead due to their lofty political ambitions. They also had developed {{a close relationship with}} Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador in Afghanistan, who was eager to use them against Amin. After the Herat city uprising on 17 March 1979, the PDPA Politburo and the Revolutionary Council established the Homeland Higher Defence Council, to which Taraki was elected its chairman while Amin became its deputy. At around the same time, Taraki left his post as Council of Ministers chairman and Amin was elected his successor. Amin's new position offered him little real influence, however; as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Amin had the power to elect every member of the cabinet, but all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be approved by the head of state, Taraki. In reality, through this maneuver Taraki had effectively reduced Amin's power base by forcing him to relinquish his hold on the Afghan army in order to take on the supposedly heavy responsibilities of his new but ultimately powerless post.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E
25|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the resettlements in 1939–1941, this time around the evacuation in most of the areas was delayed until the last moment, when {{it was too late to}} conduct it in an orderly fashion, and practically all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave most of their belongings behind.|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of the war 30,000 Chileans were {{expelled}} from Peru (within 8 days) and Bolivia (within 10 days) and their property confiscated; most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> shelter in the camps, boats and pontoons of the Peruvians ports until they were transported by ship to Antofagasta. It is calculated that 7,000 of the refugees from Peru enlisted in the Chilean battalions and their resentfulness would later influence the war. Peruvian and Bolivian residents in Chile were not expelled.|$|E
25|$|As the Chinese coins {{were not}} in {{sufficient}} number as trade and economy expanded, local Japanese imitations of Chinese coins were made from the 14th century, especially imitations of Ming coins, with inscribed names identical to those of contemporary Chinese coins. These coins were considered as very low value compared to Chinese coins, and several <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be exchanged just for one Chinese coin. This situation would continue {{until the beginning of}} the Edo period, when a new system was put in place.|$|E

25|$|The walkout tied {{up about}} ninety {{ships in the}} Port of Los Angeles. Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus {{depleting}} the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships to get under way. Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes of a number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the whole}} post-war Cromwellian {{settlement}} of Ireland has been characterised by historians such as Mark Levene and Alan Axelrod as ethnic cleansing, {{in that it}} sought to remove Irish Catholics from {{the eastern part of}} the country, others such as the historical writer Tim Pat Coogan have described the actions of Cromwell and his subordinates as genocide. The aftermath of the Cromwellian campaign and settlement saw extensive dispossession of landowners who were Catholic, and a huge drop in population. In the event, the much larger number of surviving poorer Catholics were not moved westwards; most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fend for themselves by working for the new landowners.|$|E
25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E

25|$|Turkish Air Force — Not entirely unlike Finland's Ilmavoimat air {{arm of the}} World War II years, the Turkish Air Force was {{the only}} air force, other than the Finns, who {{operated}} both Allied and Axis aircraft throughout World War II. Beginning in mid-1942, received 72 examples of the Fw 190 A-3a (export model of A-3, a stood for ausländisch—foreign) from Germany to modernize their air force. These aircraft were basically Fw 190 A-3s, with BMW 801 D-2 engines and FuG VIIa radios and an armament fit of four MG 17s, with the option of installing two MG-FF/M cannon in the outer wing positions. The export order was completed between October 1942 and March 1943. The Fw 190 remained in service {{until the end of}} 1947 after that all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be retired because of lack of spare parts.|$|E
25|$|Atta and al-Shehhi both {{encountered}} {{some difficulty}} reentering the United States, on 10 January and 19 January, respectively. As neither had presented a student visa, both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> persuade INS inspectors {{that they should}} be admitted so that they could continue their flight training. Neither operative had any problem clearing customs. After returning to Florida from their trips, Atta and al-Shehhi visited Georgia, staying briefly in Norcross and Decatur, and renting a single-engine plane to fly with an instructor in Lawrenceville. By 19 February, Atta and al-Shehhi were in Virginia. They had rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to Georgia, staying in Stone Mountain. In mid-March, Ziad Jarrah was in Georgia as well, staying in Decatur. At the end of the month, Jarrah left the United States again and visited Sengün in Germany for two weeks. In early April, Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February.|$|E
25|$|On April 2, 2008, ATA {{declared}} bankruptcy and ceased all operations. This sudden end came about after FedEx abruptly canceled ATA's longstanding military charter contract. Combined {{with a significant}} increase in the price of jet fuel, ATA did not have enough capital to stay in business. It was the third of four U.S. airlines to announce a complete shut down in the week of March 30, 2008 after Aloha Airlines did so on March 30, Minnesota-based charter Champion Air did so March 31, and Skybus Airlines terminated service on April 5. The shutdown of ATA took effect at 4:00 AM EDT, Thursday April 3, 2008, although some flights were airborne at the time and continued to their destinations, with the final arrival being ATA flight 4586 from Honolulu to Phoenix, which landed at 8:46 AM, MST, or seven hours and 46 minutes after the announced shutdown. At the time of the shutdown ATA employed around 2,300 people all of whom were permanently laid off. According to press reports, up to 10,000 passengers were affected and many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> scramble for help on several airlines. Most of them, however, had to pay for new tickets.|$|E

500|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4 in 1925, their financial status was a different story. The players' salaries were so low {{that they could not}} fully dedicate themselves to the game as most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work other jobs. The team's abbreviated practices, held at 4:30 PM each day so as not to conflict with work schedules, also allowed for little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. Mara had to spend $25,000 of his own money during the season just to keep the franchise alive. [...] This struggle continued until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting more than 73,000 fans—a pro football record. The game attracted such attention that 20,000 fans were turned away at the gates. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise.|$|E
