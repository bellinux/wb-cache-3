5|$|Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} their abilities. Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing, Leach left the band for {{personal}} and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones would stay in the band for nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing. This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E
5|$|After the touring {{process for}} the album was over, Tom Gomes left the band and was {{replaced}} by Justin Foley. This line-up of Killswitch Engage would last until early 2012, when Jones left the band. Following Jones' departure, Jesse Leach rejoined the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing.|$|E

5|$|Album art and promotional {{pictures}} from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either {{towards the end of}} <b>or</b> <b>just</b> after the Figure 8 tour.|$|E
5|$|Alive <b>or</b> <b>Just</b> Breathing {{was mixed}} in February 2002 at Backstage Productions in Ripley, Derbyshire, UK by Andy Sneap. Dutkiewicz brought the album to the UK and oversaw the mixing process. The band chose Sneap after hearing {{good things about}} his work. The band and label were both {{very pleased with the}} mix, and Dutkiewicz in {{particular}} noted his satisfaction with the drum tones.|$|E
5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and <b>or</b> <b>just</b> unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E

5|$|By careful examination, the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen.

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong <b>or</b> <b>just</b> one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor <b>or</b> <b>just</b> the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E
