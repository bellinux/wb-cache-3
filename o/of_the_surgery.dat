5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes {{this is the only}} suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2007–08 season, Öhlund {{received}} a four-game suspension, {{the first of}} his career, for an incident near the end of a November 16, 2007, game against the Minnesota Wild. In the third period, Wild forward Mikko Koivu hit Öhlund, and Öhlund retaliated by slashing Koivu in the leg with his stick, breaking Koivu's fibula. After returning from the suspension, Öhlund became the Canucks' all-time leader in goals among defencemen, scoring the game-tying goal against the Edmonton Oilers on December 15, 2007, to pass former teammate Jyrki Lumme with 84 goals. After bone chips were detected in his knee in early March 2008, Öhlund underwent knee surgery on March 13 and missed the remainder of the season. The leading scorer amongst Canucks defencemen at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> Öhlund finished second amongst the defencemen with 24 points in 53 games.|$|E

50|$|Common {{emergency}} cases include child delivery, traumatic injuries, pelvic bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries</b> performed include thyroidectomies, tonsillectomies, vagotomies, pyloroplasties, chronic osteomyelitis amputations, hysterectomies, tubal ligations, C-sections {{as well as}} eye surgeries.|$|R
30|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixtures, namely, US II® (Osstem implant, Seoul, Korea), Solar® (Shinhung, Seoul, Korea), and SLActive® (Straumann, Basel, Swiss) {{underwent}} {{surface treatment}} processes, such as sandblasting, large grit, and acid etching.

5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April 2017, Bain {{elaborated}} on {{the results}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> noting a disagreement between his surgeons and his oncologist regarding the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> {{and the possibility of}} the emergence of two small lesions within the liver. Bain stated that he intended to take another round of chemotherapy in order to break the deadlock.|$|E
25|$|However, Mujib {{withdrew from}} school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery, and {{returned}} to school only after four years, owing to the severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> and slow recovery.|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} may {{form the basis}} for further assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>surgery</b> in such patients, taking into consideration <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> pre- and postoperative nutritional status. In fact, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries</b> in IBD patients are performed as emergencies and offer little potential to optimise nutritional status prior to surgery. Nevertheless, patients with myosteatosis, despite spending longer in hospital, {{were also more likely to}} require readmission.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hugely popular}} wrinkle remover, Botox (Dysport in the United Kingdom and Europe) many {{consumers}} have eschewed <b>the</b> invasive <b>surgery</b> altogether, opting for Botox injections every {{four to six}} months to get the same results. Botox is also used after some forehead lift procedures to increase <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries.</b>|$|R
30|$|Retrosceptive {{audit of}} {{surgical}} management of ectopic pregnancy {{over seven years}} in a University teaching Hospital.

25|$|Hysterectomy, in {{the literal}} {{sense of the}} word, means merely removal of the uterus. However other organs such as ovaries, fallopian tubes and the cervix are very {{frequently}} removed as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abdominoplasty {{operations}} vary {{in scope}} and are frequently subdivided into categories. Depending on the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> a complete abdominoplasty can take from 1 to 5 hours. A partial abdominoplasty (mini-tuck abdominoplasty) can be completed between 1 and 2 hours.|$|E

40|$|A {{cohort study}} {{was carried out}} at the Marilia Medical School Hospital. In the first phase <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> {{antibiotic}} use was evaluated. Antibiotics were prescribed for 55. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients; antibiotic combinations were used in 43 %. Therapeutic use of antibiotics was considered inadequate in 27 %. Respiratory and skin infections were the most frequently diagnosed. In up to 31 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> respiratory infections was considered inadequate. <b>The</b> surgical use <b>of</b> antibiotic prophylaxis was evaluated in the second phase. Prophylaxis was indicated in 73. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries.</b> <b>The</b> antibiotics most used for prophylaxis were first generation cephalosporins. In 78. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries,</b> <b>the</b> antibiotic was correctly chosen. In 15. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgeries,</b> <b>the</b> initial antibiotic administration was correctly timed. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> antibiotics in <b>the</b> post-operative period was appropriate in 29. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases. The independent risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI), as determined by logistic regression analysis adjusted to class of wound risk, were <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> antibiotic to be used prophylactically and <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> antibiotic treatment in the post-operative period. Those who received appropriate prophylactic antibiotics had a lower rate of SSI than those who received innapropriated antibiotics [RR= 0. 49 / 95 %; CI= 0. 25 - 0. 90].

25|$|A {{caesarean}} section {{is associated with}} risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections. If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> may be increased due {{to a number of}} factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia. Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and postdural-puncture spinal headaches.|$|E
25|$|Another {{surgical}} {{option for}} ulcerative colitis that is affecting {{most of the}} large bowel is called the ileo-anal pouch procedure. This is a two- to three-step procedure in which the large bowel is removed, except for the rectal stump and anus, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The next part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> {{can be done in}} one or two steps and is usually done at six- to twelve-month intervals from each prior surgery.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy is {{better or worse}} for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer. There is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers. Approximately 2.8% of people having a first surgery for advanced ovarian cancer die within two weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> (2.8% perioperative mortality rate). More aggressive surgeries are associated with better outcomes in advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|While renal {{replacement}} therapies {{can maintain}} people indefinitely and prolong life, {{the quality of}} life is negatively affected. Kidney transplantation increases the survival of people with stage 5 CKD when compared to other options; however, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> Transplantation aside, high-intensity home hemodialysis appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life, when compared to the conventional three-times-a-week hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
