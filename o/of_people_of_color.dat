25|$|While {{there is}} a {{northeast}} to southwest topographic transition from elevated areas inland to the lower coastal band, there is no formal geographic division between North and South County. Perpendicular to that gradient, the Santa Ana River roughly divides the county into northwestern and southeastern sectors. Each sector comprises 40 to 60 percent of the county respectively by area. There are significant political, demographic, economic, and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County, with North Orange County having greater populations <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> younger populations, greater percentages of renters, lower median incomes, higher rates of unemployment, and greater proportions of voters registered as Democrats versus as Republicans. However, certain areas in both North and South Orange County vary from these general trends.|$|E

The conference venue was at the Gedung Merdeka, the former Concordia Society building. The conference announced 10 points of declaration for the promotion of world peace promotion and for opposition against colonialism, and is known as the Declaration of Bandung. This was followed by a wave of nationalism movements around the globe which remapped world politics.

Richard Wright in his book, The Color Curtain, claims that there was epic meaning of the conference for people of color around the world.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Raynal's influence, Toussaint Louverture {{was a key}} Enlightened actor in the Haitian Revolution. Enlightened thought divided the world into [...] "enlightened leaders" [...] and [...] "ignorant masses"; Louverture attempted to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few. Louverture was familiar with Enlightenment ideas {{within the context of}} European imperialism. He attempted {{to strike a balance between}} Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> on Saint Domingue. As an extension of himself and his Enlightened education, Louverture wrote a Constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, Louverture exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language and accent of this text.|$|E

[...] Martin Luther King Jr. criticized this position at the 68th Annual Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative Judaism, [...] "On the Middle East crisis, we have had various responses. The responses of the so-called young militants does not represent {{the position of the}} vast majority of Negroes.

[...] In one 1888 article, it reminded its readers that [...] "yesterday we were slaves, today we are free, we want to participate in life, claim our rights, we want consideration and respect." [...] The Brotherhood reported on living conditions: the main concerns and worries of the black population; even publishing the letters <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> who wrote in about their misfortunes and experiences.

[...] The ITV News article reported that “Some black and ethnic minority students at a leading university have said they are unhappy about being taught by old white professors” The report itself investigated the reasons why a greater proportion of white students at SOAS attain a 2:1 or first class degree, compared to BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) students. Some participants within the report stated that there is an “over representation of white people among staff and students on some courses.” Furthermore, the BME participants highlighted the impact of the “whiteness of the curriculum than that of any other aspect of learning and teaching.” The report also stated that, “discussions dominated by ‘white male students’, made minority female students feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened” and that “Having white students voice dominate was especially frustrating when the discussion was about political or theoretical interventions <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> or about racist violence.” One BME student also had issues with “white teachers teaching white students about black/brown people.” Some BME students felt silenced also “by the pressure to communicate using academic language that – for reasons of structural racism – was closer to the everyday speech of middle-class, white students than their own.” The report recommended that “All academics must be prepared to acknowledge that, no matter their research specialism, they are capable of racism, and should be prepared to discuss how.” Other recommendations included “Introduce mandatory unconscious bias workshops for all assessors and staff on recruitment or promotion panels.” ...|$|E

After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves.
