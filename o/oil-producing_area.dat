50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Gulf of Mexico states, old oil platforms have not been converted to artificial reefs in offshore California, the only other offshore <b>oil-producing</b> <b>area</b> in the contiguous 48 states. A number of reasons have been cited for this, primarily {{the strength of the}} environmental movement in California, its antagonistic relationship with the oil industry, and its reluctance to support any measure that would financially benefit the offshore oil industry. Other differences include the smaller number of offshore platforms (27 off California, versus approximately 4,500 in the Gulf of Mexico), and the smaller portion of the California economy made up by oil and fishing.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} presenting visual acuities at an eye center in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Study Design: Retrospective chart review Methods: A retrospective review of patient records attending a private referral eye center providing services for company patients {{and the general public}} in the region. Information was obtained from computerized medical records of 6533 patients who attended the center for various eye concerns in a 5 -year period (January 1998 to December 2002). Results: A total of 6533 patients were seen in this 5 -year period of which 2472 (37. 8 &#x 0025;) were company patients and 4061 (62. 2 &#x 0025;). were private patients. There were 3879 males (59. 4 &#x 0025;) and 2654 females (40. 6 &#x 0025;). A visual acuity of 6 / 6 or better was seen in 50. 8 &#x 0025; of the patients. In 76. 6 &#x 0025; of patients, a visual acuity of 6 / 18 or better was recorded. There were 21. 4 &#x 0025; of patients in the low vision group. Bilateral blindness occurred in 2. 1 &#x 0025; of patients. Monocular blindness occurred in 3. 7 &#x 0025; of patients. Low vision occurred in 16. 9 &#x 0025; of company patients and 24. 1 &#x 0025; of private patients. Bilateral blindness occurred in 0. 9 &#x 0025; of company patients and 2. 7 &#x 0025; of private patients, while monocular blindness occurred in 1. 2 &#x 0025; of company patients and 5. 2 &#x 0025; of private patients. The main ocular problems were refractive error, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, headaches, ocular trauma, retina and related pathologies, cataract, uveitis, pterygium and corneal problems. Conclusion: The incidence of low vision and blindness is high in the <b>oil-producing</b> <b>area</b> of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
