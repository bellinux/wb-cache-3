60|$|If {{speculation}} tends thus to {{a terrific}} unity, {{in which all}} things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course of gravitation of mind; {{the second is the}} power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> intellect; one is necessity; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> freedom; one, rest; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> motion; one, power; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> distribution; one, strength; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> pleasure; one, consciousness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> definition; one, genius; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> talent, one, earnestness; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> knowledge; one, possession; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> trade; one, caste; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> culture; one king; <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, {{that the end of the}} one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is <b>the</b> highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity.|$|R

5000|$|Emmanuel Levinas {{disagreed}} with Heidegger's position regarding ecstasy and existential temporality {{from the perspective}} of the experience of insomnia. Levinas talked of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'.

Furthermore, he asserted that ecstasy, or exteriority toward <b>the</b> <b>Other,</b> forever remains beyond any attempt at full capture; this otherness is interminable or infinite. This [...] "infiniteness" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> would allow Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy as secondary to this ethic.
