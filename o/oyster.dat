5|$|The first {{specimens}} of C.mutica outside of its native range was recovered from Humboldt Bay, California by Donald M. Martin in 1973.

Additional specimens (also treated as C.acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. It wasn't until 1981, when the specimens were correctly identified as C.mutica by Dan C. Marelli. Along with additional specimens discovered in 1983 in Coos Bay, Oregon, these populations {{are believed to have}} been introduced to the area {{as a result of the}} importation of <b>oyster</b> spat of the Pacific <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas) from Japan for <b>oyster</b> farming.

40|$|This study, {{conducted}} in the 'open' reef systems of Solomon Islands, assessed growth and survival of blacklip pearl <b>oysters</b> (Pinctada margaritifera, L.) on chaplets in suspended culture. <b>Oysters</b> were robust and mortalities after handling and drilling were low (< 0. 6 %). Survival of an initial batch of P. margaritifera was 87 % after 1 year. Groups of <b>oysters</b> with mean dorsoventral measurements (DVM) of 63 and 71 mm showed mean (± SE) annual growth rates of 64 ± 2 and 60 ± 1 mm, respectively. Growth rates compared favorably with those reported for P. margaritifera in Polynesia and indicate that <b>oysters</b> caught as spat (approx. 11 mm, DVM) would reach acceptable size for 'seeding' (110 mm DVM) in around 16 months. <b>Oysters</b> on chaplets were subject to significant fouling by algae, however, survival of <b>oysters</b> cleaned every 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks was 96 - 97 % over a 7 -month period. Growth of <b>oysters</b> cleaned every 3 weeks was significantly greater than those cleaned every 2 or 6 weeks. <b>Oysters</b> became detached from chaplets (through drill-hole breakage) in significant numbers; this problem was greater for smaller <b>oysters.</b> When <b>oysters</b> were attached singly on chaplets, approximately 54 % made byssal attachments to the rope; however, 90 % of <b>oysters</b> held in pairs on chaplets made byssal attachments to each other.

5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue <b>Öyster</b> Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue <b>Öyster</b> Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue <b>Öyster</b> Cult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. gasar <b>oysters</b> are {{cultivated}} {{in the northeast}} region. Perkinsus parasites infect bivalves, and their effects on <b>oysters</b> from tropical regions are poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of Perkinsus infection on the productive traits of native <b>oysters.</b> <b>Oysters</b> were sampled bimonthly during 7 months, from July 2010 to February 2011, to evaluate growth rate, mortality and shell color patterns (white and dark-gray) (n = 500), and to determine the prevalence and intensity of Perkinsus (n = 152). Perkinsus and Crassostrea species were determined using molecular tools. Results showed that most dark-gray (90 %, n = 20) and white (67 %, n = 18) <b>oysters</b> were C. gasar and C. rhizophorae, respectively. <b>Oysters</b> showed a high growth rate and moderate cumulative mortality (44 %). C. gasar <b>oysters</b> grew better and showed lower mortality and lower incidence of Perkinsus compared to C. rhizophorae. The mean prevalence of Perkinsus was moderate (48 %), but the infection intensity was light (2. 2). Perkinsosis affected very small <b>oysters</b> (19. 4 mm). In conclusion, native <b>oysters,</b> especially C. gasar, have a great potential for culture, mortality is not associated with perkinsosis, and the shell color of <b>oysters</b> {{can be used to}} improve selection for spats with better performance...|$|R

5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife.

The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. <b>Oyster</b> beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 <b>Oysters</b> can {{be easily}} {{contaminated}} with spoilage and pathogenic bacteria through contaminated waster. The United States produces more than 27 million pounds of <b>oysters</b> each year {{and most of them}} are sold and consumed raw without further processing. Growth of naturally contaminating bacteria in <b>oysters</b> during storage results in loss of quality and product value. Contamination of pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus in <b>oysters</b> is also a safety concern of the industry and consumers. The traditional depuration process for reducing bacterial contamination in <b>oysters</b> using clean seawater has been reported to be ineffective in reducing Vibrio contamination in <b>oysters.</b> This study investigated effects of electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water treatment on reducing both V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus contamination in <b>oysters.</b> Freshly harvested Pacific <b>oysters</b> were inoculated with 5 -strain cocktail of V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus at levels of 10 ⁴ and 10 ⁶ MPN/g. Inoculated <b>oysters</b> were held in EO water (chlorine: 30 ppm, pH: 2. 82, ORP: 1131 mV) containing 1 % NaCl at room temperature. Reductions of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in <b>oysters</b> during the treatment were determined at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. EO water containing 30 ppm of chlorine was found to exhibit strong bactericidal effects against pure cultures of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus (> 6. 6 -log reductions in 15 s). Holding <b>oysters</b> inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus in EO water (30 pin chlorine) containing 1 % NaCl for 4 - 6 h resulted in significant reductions of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus by 1. 13 and 1. 05 log MPN/g, respectively. However, extended exposure (> 12 h) of <b>oysters</b> in EO water containing high levels of chlorine (> 30 ppm) was found to be detrimental to <b>oysters.</b> EO water could be used as a post-harvest treatment to reduce Vibrio contamination in <b>oysters.</b> However, treatment should be limited to 4 - 6 h to avoid death of <b>oysters.</b> Further studies are needed to determine effects of EO water treatments on sensory characteristics of treated <b>oysters...</b>|$|R
