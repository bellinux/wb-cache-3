5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established <b>operating</b> <b>procedure,</b> the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E

Woodlark and Kiriwina were required as future airfield sites to support operations in both New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomon Islands.

25|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that the incident {{did not appear to be}} linked to organized international terrorist groups. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs reaffirmed what Homeland Security said, and that President Barack Obama was briefed on the incident. The President expressed his concern and commended the courageous actions of the first responders. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) launched two F-16 fighter aircraft from Ellington Airport in Houston, Texas, to conduct an air patrol in response to the crash. That action was reported as standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> in this situation.|$|E
25|$|On May 2012, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) {{released}} its final {{report on the}} investigation. It determined that a visual approach {{should not have been}} attempted due to low visibility. There was no checklist reading or crew briefing. The flight crew lacked situation awareness while trying to locate the runway and while performing the go-around. The aircraft entered a rapid descent during the go-around due to a 38-degree left roll and crew commanded flap retraction from 15 to 0 degrees. Both crew members had low experience and flying time on type. The inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the training program may lead to actions that deviate from standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> and that regress to a previous aircraft type.|$|E
25|$|The {{police station}} site was not secured until {{several days after}} the event. Only Corporal Si Miller's SA-80 rifle was {{recovered}} from the scene.

One of the Iraqi eye-witnesses to the event, Sheikh Shejar (head of the Al Shuganbah tribe) later stated {{that at least one of}} the RMPs had fired and in doing so killed a member of the crowd. However, Mark Nichol in his book, Last Round, states that it would have been against the RMPs' Standard <b>Operating</b> <b>Procedure</b> (SOP) to fire upon a crowd of protestors.|$|E

Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) had {{previously}} stated that only one detainee had a rag in his throat. The NCIS described the detainees bonds as loose and easily tied by the prisoners, and {{said that the}}y did not have to climb to the sinks for hanging. Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> (SOP) when criminal actions are possible). The NCIS report notes that numerous guards, detainees and medical personnel attested to seeing the deceased being transferred from the cellblock to the infirmary. Video records of the cellblock (which did not show the interiors of the cells) did not reveal anything amiss.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedure.</b> It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
25|$|NSB {{presumed that}} a similar <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> be carried out for a branch service. However, it {{proposed}} a different route which branched off west of Lysaker Station. By linking these with various lines to the east, this would allow direct services to the airport from the Østfold Line, the Gjøvik Line and the Trunk Line. For a loop service, NSB proposed that the airport be served with existing commuter trains running on the Drammen Line between Asker Station and Lillestrøm Station (today's line L1). The main advantage {{was that it would}} allow all regional and express trains, including those serving to the Bergen Line, the Sørlandet Line and the Vestfold Line, to call at the airport. Travel times were estimated at 12 minutes to Oslo Central Station, 18 minutes to Asker, and 25 and 33 minutes, respectively by commuter and express train, to Drammen Station. NSB estimated a twenty-five percent market share, giving an estimated 3,500 to 8,000 daily passengers, depending on how much airline traffic was allocated to Fornebu. A major advantage was that it would largely come as an additional product for existing services and would thus be economically favorable for NSB.|$|E
