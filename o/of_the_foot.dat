5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> before inserting {{at the base of}} the toes, and supports the arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{punching}} shear failure often governs <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footing-to-column connection. The {{punching shear}} failure is an undesirable failure mode, since {{it results in}} a brittle failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> In this study, a new method to increase the strength and ductility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> was proposed by inserting the punching shear preventers (PSPs) into <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> <b>The</b> validation and effectiveness of PSP were verified through a series <b>of</b> experimental studies. <b>The</b> nonlinear finite element analysis was then performed to demonstrate <b>the</b> failure mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs in depth and to investigate the key parameters that affect <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs. Finally, the design recommendations for <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs were suggested...|$|R

30|$|Based on Figure  21, {{it shows}} that <b>the</b> curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum normal forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> present a {{gradually}} downward trend for leg 2 and leg 5, and gradually rising trends for the other legs, with the initial angle varying from 0 ° to 60 °. When the initial angle is in between 0 ° and 50 °, the maximum normal forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> leg 2 and leg 5 are greater than the maximum normal forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> other legs. <b>The</b> maximum normal forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> are approximately equal to each other, when the initial angle is 60 °. Based on Figures  15 and 21, {{it can be found}} that <b>the</b> variable tendencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum normal forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> are respectively corresponding to the same for legs 2, 4, and 6, when the step pitch is 0.2  m and the initial angle varies from 0 ° to 60 °.|$|R

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> The pain is usually most severe with the first steps {{of the day or}} following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E

40|$|Rope {{skipping}} {{seems to}} be an easy task to be performed. However, careful analysis of this motor skill shows how complex <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> this task is. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> {{this study was to examine}} kinematic variables of jump patterns as a function of skipping frequency. Eight male university students performed a sequence of 30 rope jumps using two jump patterns (alternating support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> and simultaneous support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet)</b> at three skipping frequencies (1. 5, 1. 7, 1. 9 Hz). Frequencies were determined with a digital metronome and the rope was turned by the student himself. Rope jumping performance was recorded with two digital cameras for 3 Danalysis. Passive markers were attached to the rope and to the ankle, knee and hip joints forcollection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following dependent variables: continuous relative phase, time interval betweenthe loss <b>of</b> contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> with <b>the</b> ground and cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rope under <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volunteer,jump height, and rope height.

5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Veratalpa lugdunensiana is {{a fossil}} mammal from the Miocene of France. Known {{from a single}} astragalus (a footbone), the species was {{assigned}} to its own genus, Veratalpa, by Florentino Ameghino in 1905. He placed it in Talpidae, {{the family of the}} moles, but in 1974, John Howard Hutchison argued that the astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent. The astragalus is about 4.5mm long, broad for a talpid, and has the head oriented farther from the axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> than in talpids.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.|$|E
