40|$|Recognition of prodromal {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia {{offers the potential}} of early intervention to avert relapse and re-hospitalization (Carpenter & Heinrichs, 1983). The present study investigated how a strategy to detect prodromal signs might be effectively applied in the clinical setting. A standard monitoring system was developed involving completion of a new early signs scale (ESS) measuring changes in key symptoms phenomenologically (self-report) and behaviourally (<b>observer</b> <b>report).</b> The ESS was subject to rigorous psychometric evaluation and tested in a prospective pilot investigation. The ESS reliably identified early signs and predicted relapse with an overall accuracy of 79 %. Several different patterns of relapse were identified. Observer reports compensated for loss of insight in some patients. In two cases where early signs indices were detected, prompt increases in medication appeared to arrest relapse and avert readmission. The ESS offers itself as a reliable, valid and administratively feasible measure and demonstrates considerable potential as a cost-effective procedure for secondary prevention...|$|E

40|$|Comparing {{different}} novel feature {{sets and}} classifiers for speech processing based fatigue detectionis {{is the primary}} aim of this study. Thus, we conducted a within-subject partial sleep deprivation design (20. 00 - 04. 00 h, N = 77 participants) and recorded 372 speech samples of sustained vowel phonation. The self-report on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and an <b>observer</b> <b>report</b> on the KSS, the KSS Observer Scale were applied to determine sleepiness reference values. Feature extraction methods of non-linear dynamics (NLD) provide additional information regarding the dynamics and structure of sleepiness speech. In all, 395 NLD features and the 170 phonetic features which have been computed partially represent so far unknown auditive-perceptual concepts. Several NLD and phonetic features show significant correlations to KSS ratings, e. g., from the NLD features for male speakers the skewness of vector length within reconstructed phase space (r =. 56), and for female speaker the mean of Cao‟s minimum embedding dimensions (r =-. 39).

40|$|Copyright © 2003 by Lawrence Erlbaum AssociatesThis study {{examines}} the neurobehavioral functioning {{of persons with}} Parkinson's disease (PD) using the Neuropsychology Behavior and Affect Profile (NBAP), a self-report version of the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NRS-Revised), and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). In the absence of existing data, {{the psychometric properties of}} these measures were assessed prior to examining neurobehavioral functioning. Self- and <b>observer</b> <b>report</b> versions of the NBAP, NRS-Revised, and DEX were administered to a group of 30 persons with PD and 30 matched controls. Reliability analyses revealed that, although the total scores from these measures provided internally reliable assessments of neurobehavioral functioning, the sub-scale scores of the NBAP demonstrated lower reliability. In addition, the 3 measures of neurobehavioral functioning showed moderate to high correlations with one another and with measures of disease severity. When the PD and control groups were compared on measures of current neurobehavioral functioning, the PD group was found to exhibit problems on the NRS-Revised. Since the onset of their disease, the PD group showed increasing levels of depression, inappropriate behavior, and a reduced ability to follow the subtleties of communication as measured by the NBAP. There was good agreement between self- and observer-reports of neurobehavioral functioning, suggesting that problems with insight did not affect patients' reports of symptomatology. Overall, the findings indicate the emergence of a number of neurobehavioral problems {{in the early stages of}} PD that are likely to adversely affect the social interactions of persons with PD. When combined with the motor and cognitive effects of PD, these problems may lead to social isolation. J. L. Mathia...|$|E

40|$|Fatal {{earthquakes}} such as {{that which}} occurred in Christchurch on February 22 nd 2011, can result in survivors having difficulties with cognitively processing the event, {{which may be the}} precursor to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Trauma related dissociation has been proposed to be a mechanism related to these cognitive processing difficulties. Most research focusing on information processing and dissociation post-trauma has conducted controlled analogue studies or has not focused solely on information processing and dissociation. There is also scant research on these constructs across therapy. In response to this gap in research, two studies were developed. An association was proposed between dissociation and information processing as demonstrated by an increase in conceptual processing and a reduction in dissociation. It was predicted that an improvement in these constructs would be related to a reduction in PTSD symptoms over therapy. Study 1 applied a case-study design to 5 individuals who were attending therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in response to the trauma they had experienced from the Christchurch earthquakes. Study 2 assessed information processing and dissociation (via self and <b>observer</b> <b>report)</b> in 20 individuals who had direct exposure to the effects of the earthquake. Earthquake information processing and dissociation were assessed as they were happening nearly two year’s post-quake using correlation analyses and hierarchical regressions. The hypotheses were partially confirmed, in that an increase in conceptual processing was not shown to be associated with a reduction in dissociation. However, an increase in conceptual processing was shown to be related to trauma symptom improvement particularly for re-experiencing symptoms. In addition, study 2 demonstrated a possible relationship between trait dissociation and arousal symptoms. These findings partially support the proposed role information processing and dissociation play in the recovery from PTSD. The findings suggest that trauma related difficulties should be assessed as early as possible to resolve issues related to a delay in symptom reporting...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of client gender and counselor gender on the counselor's perception of the psychological attributes of the client. The hypotheses were stated in the null form. Fifty-six subjects volunteered to participate in the study. Subjects were first stratified into groups of equal size according to gender. Utilizing a table of random numbers, one-half of the female subjects was assigned to the female client treatment group, and the other half of the female subjects was assigned to the male client treatment group. The same procedure was utilized in assigning the male subjects to the two treatment groups. These procedures resulted in four groups, each containing fourteen persons. The subjects were all students in master's level classes in counseling, enrolled in Ball Stated University's European Program. The clients in the study were portrayed by two individuals, one male and one female, who presented the same text dealing with personal and professional issues. This role-play, recorded in color on video-film, was presented to the subjects as a client discussing personal issues. Each subject viewed either the male or the female client on video-film. The counselor's perception of the client's psychological attributes was measured by comparing the number of favorable versus the number of unfavorable adjectives of the Adjective Check List (ACL), which, for purposes of this study, was utilized as an <b>observer</b> <b>report.</b> All subjects were tested during the Summer Quarter of 1982, utilizing a Posttest-Only Control Group Design. Hypothesis I was tested by means of a Two-way Analysis of Variance. The results of the first hypothesis were not significant at the. 05 level, and the null hypothesis was not rejected. Hypothesis II was also tested through a Two-way Analysis of Variance, and the results were significant at the. 05 level. Therefore, the null hypothesis for the second hypothesis was rejected.

40|$|Boys are {{generally}} less successful at school than girls, especially in secondary education. More specifically, {{they tend to}} show lower achievement, higher dropout rates, and lower student engagement. Teacher support {{has been found to}} positively influence students’ engagement and achievement. However, boys and girls might perceive the support of their teachers differently. Moreover, teacher support could relate to boys’ and girls’ outcomes differently. This dissertation aims to clarify secondary school students’ perceptions of teacher support and examines the relationship between teacher support and engagement. In addition, our goal is to investigate male and female teachers’ perceptions of teacher support. Educational research and practice discussed possible {{differences between men and women}} as teachers for boys and girls. This discussion has not often considered actual supportive behavior of teachers and the concept of gender as a broader sociocultural construct. The data used in this dissertation were collected in Grades 7 and 8 in (a selection of) 59 secondary schools in Flanders in the light of the Procrustes project, searching for gender-related factors that predict low achievement, retention, and dropout of secondary school students. A first chapter reviewed literature on differences between boys’ and girls’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement in secondary education. Girls generally showed higher engagement than boys, especially for behavioral engagement, more specifically at the school level. For particular subjects and activities in class, the advantage of girls was less consistent. These findings call for more research on boys’ and girls’ engagement regarding individual subjects and activities. In the second chapter, we investigated, for Dutch language classes, sex differences in the relationship between students’ perceptions of three dimensions of teacher support (i. e., autonomy support, structure, and involvement) and student engagement. A total of 385 Grade 7 students (58 % boys) of six secondary schools in Flanders and their Dutch language teachers participated. A model was constructed with each of the teacher support dimensions as an independent variable and behavioral engagement as a latent dependent variable with three indicators (i. e., teacher, student, and <b>observer</b> <b>report).</b> The results suggested that boys showed lower engagement than girls and that they considered their teachers to be less supportive for all dimensions. Moreover, autonomy support appeared to be more important for boys’ engagement, whereas structure and involvement were equally relevant for both boys’ and girls’ engagement. The third chapter investigated differences in boys’ and girls’ perceptions of their actual teachers and of hypothetical situations (vignettes) depicting teachers who differ in autonomy support and structure. Participants were 377 Grade 8 students from the academic track in eight secondary schools in Flanders. The results showed that boys rated their actual teachers lower in autonomy support and structure. The scores for the vignettes indicated that boys were less negative than girls about a hypothetical teacher that provided low structure, whereas they were less positive than girls about a teacher that provided high autonomy support. We suggested that boys’ and girls’ perceptions of the vignettes might differ according to what teacher behavior they consider important. Moreover, the hypothesis that teachers in fact act differently towards boys versus girls could not be dismissed. The fourth chapter examined male and female teachers’ perceptions of their provided teacher support and the role of two sociocultural aspects of gender. These were (1) restricted emotionality or the inability to express emotions and (2) pressure for gender conformity or the extent to which a man or a woman feels pressure to be a typical man or woman (i. e., conformity to gender stereotypes). A sample of 1, 244 teachers (28. 5 % male) in 59 secondary schools in Flanders filled out questionnaires. The results revealed that male and female teachers each scored higher for different dimensions of teacher support (e. g., male teachers scored higher for autonomy support and female teachers for structure). Additional analyses demonstrated that most of the sex differences in teacher support were mediated by restricted emotionality and pressure for gender conformity. Moreover, both sociocultural gender variables were negatively related to teacher support. Altogether the four studies demonstrate that boys and girls indeed perceive their teachers differently, even in an experimentally controlled situation, and that this perception is related to their engagement, which appears to be lower for boys. These results stress the need for careful reflection and optimization of teacher support, especially concerning autonomy support, when we aim to close the gender gap in students’ engagement and perceptions of teacher support. status: publishe...|$|E
