25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of <b>ordinary</b> <b>postage</b> stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn Parcel Post stamps were allowed for use to pay the postage for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of Parcel Post stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|E
50|$|The IRC was {{introduced}} in 1906 at a Universal Postal Union congress in Rome. At the time an IRC could be exchanged for a single-rate, <b>ordinary</b> <b>postage</b> stamp for surface delivery to a foreign country, as this was before the introduction of airmail services. An IRC is exchangeable in a UPU member country for the minimum postage of a priority or unregistered airmail letter to a foreign country.|$|E
50|$|Bhutan Post uses postage {{labels for}} both regular and {{registered}} letters, and Express Mail Service (EMS). All postage labels will indicate date and time, the sending post office, place of addressee, weight of envelope, {{and costs of}} postage. EMS and registered letters also indicate name of receiver, EMS or registration tracking number and the registration fee. Registered letters and domestic EMS letters using a postal label, will also have a separate registration or EMS label with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding bar-code, while for international EMS covers {{this is part of}} the main label. Registered letters using <b>ordinary</b> <b>postage</b> stamps, will have an analog registration number, often written by hand on the envelope.|$|E
50|$|From 1880 <b>ordinary</b> penny <b>postage</b> stamps {{were used}} to save up one {{shilling}} (12 pence) which was then sufficient to open a Post Office Savings Bank account, although the minimum amount required changed to £1 in 1912. This scheme continued until after the Second World War but has now ended. In addition the Bank used specially designed savings stamps with higher values which also {{could be used to}} save enough to open an account.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{post offices}} in China {{were among the}} post offices {{maintained}} by foreign powers in China from the mid-19th century until 1922. The first French Post Office in China opened in 1862. Initially, the French government used <b>ordinary</b> French <b>postage</b> stamps for these offices. These forerunner stamps can be shown to have been sold or used in China only by a postmark. Stamps used at Shanghai prior to 1876, for example, can only be identified by diamond-shaped cancel made of a type referred to (in French) as a “losange à gros chiffres” with the numbers [...] "5104" [...] {{in the center of}} the cancel.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the above}} post offices, the French {{government}} issued stamps of the [...] "Peace and Commerce" [...] series overprinted {{with the word}} [...] "CHINE" [...] beginning in 1894. Stamp issues of the 20th century initially included overprints applied {{to some of the}} stamps issued for use in French Indochina, and continued with stamps printed specifically for use in China. Some earlier 20th century stamps were issued only with face values expressed in French francs, but all later issues were overprinted with the equivalent of the stamp’s Chinese currency face value expressed in both French and Chinese. [...] In addition to <b>ordinary</b> <b>postage</b> stamps, France also issued postal stationery and postage due stamps for use at the Paris-run Chinese post offices.|$|E
