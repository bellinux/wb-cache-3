5|$|The Free State <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> Island) was a whimsical name given to the coastal city <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> in the U.S. state of Texas during the early-to-mid-20thcentury. Today, the term is sometimes used to describe the culture and history of that era.|$|E
5|$|By 1860, Houston {{had emerged}} as a {{commercial}} and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Galveston.</b> After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port <b>of</b> <b>Galveston.</b> By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The History <b>of</b> <b>Galveston,</b> Texas, {{begins with}} the archaeological record of Native Americans who used the island. The first European {{settlements}} on the island were constructed around 1816. The Port <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its successful revolution from Spain. The city served as the main port for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution. Galveston was founded in 1836 by Matthew Sabo and served as {{the capital of the}} Republic of Texas. The Battle <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> was fought in Galveston Bay during the American Civil War when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> was a booming {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} devastated the city <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> and heavily damaged {{communities around the}} bay. According to some estimates the death toll on the coast outside <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> may have been over one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E

5|$|The city <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> became {{important}} in the slave trade, establishing itself as the largest slave market west of New Orleans. Census records from 1860 show a population of 1178 slaves (and two free blacks) compared to 6000 free persons living in the city. The proportion of slaves, however, was somewhat less {{than the rest of}} Texas. Tensions over slavery in the U.S. as a whole eventually led to the American Civil War, which Texas joined {{on the side of the}} Confederacy. The Battle <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> was fought in Galveston Bay and island on January 1, 1863, when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city, which remained in Confederate hands for the duration of the war. In May 1865, the Lark successfully evaded the Union blockade off <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> Harbor and headed for Havana, becoming the final Confederate ship to slip through the blockade from any Southern port. In the late 1890s, the Fort Crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries were constructed in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{in which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} though no major battles were fought on the mainland shoreline. New fortifications, like Fort Chambers near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston. The GH Railroad {{was used in the}} recapture <b>of</b> <b>Galveston</b> by Confederate forces in 1863.

5|$|Named after Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez (born in Macharaviaya, Malaga, Spain), Galveston's first European {{settlements}} on {{the island}} were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight Spain.

Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E
