50|$|In 1904, in {{combination}} with his brothers Louis and William, George Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Co. in Walden, and began developing {{a new series of}} switchblades, which he patented in 1906-07. Schrade's new Safety Pushbutton Knives incorporated several design improvements over his earlier work, and featured a handle-mounted <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> with a sliding safety switch. A multi-blade <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> allowed the knife to operate with up to four automatic blades. In successive patents from 1906 through 1916 Schrade would steadily improve this design, which would later become known as the Presto series. With the Presto line, Schrade would largely dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next forty years. Schrade would go on to manufacture thousands of contract switchblade knives under several trademarks and brands, including E. Weck, Wade & Butcher, and Case XX, while other companies used Schrade's patent as the basis for their own switchblade patterns. Among these were pocket and folding hunter pattern switchblades bearing the name Keen Kutter, a trademark owned by E.C. Simmons Hardware Co. (later purchased by the Shapleigh Hardware Co.).|$|E
50|$|In 1906-07, Schrade {{patented}} the Safety Pushbutton Knives, {{an improved}} series of switchblade knives with side-mounted <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> and a sliding safety switch. Later developed in slightly modified form as the Presto series, the Schrade switchblade {{would come to}} dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next fifty-five years. In the 1920s, Schrade bought the defunct Walden Cutlery Company {{in order to obtain}} their stocks of handle material for his knives.|$|E
50|$|Schrade Cutlery Company had {{its roots}} in the New York Press Button Knife Company, formed in 1892 by George Schrade, an {{inventor}} from Sheffield, England. Unable to raise sufficient capital to begin knife production, Schrade sold a partial interest in the company to the Walden Knife Company. The company's unusual name arose from its first knife design, a switchblade or automatic-opening pocket knife with an <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> mounted in the knife bolster. First patented by Schrade in 1892, the knife was eventually produced with a unique style of clip point blade. In 1903, Schrade sold all of his interest in the New York Press Button Knife Co. to Walden Knife Company. The following year, Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Company in Walden.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} were responsive, could {{run up to}} speed quite quickly, had light-touch <b>operating</b> <b>buttons,</b> forward-facing heads (The BTR 1s had rear-facing heads which made editing difficult), and were quick and easy to do the finest editing on.|$|R

He {{was able to}} put a card into a cash machine, retrieve the card when the process was complete, and return the card to a wallet.|$|R
50|$|Class 306 trains {{were built}} to a pre-World War II LNER design by Metro Cammell and Birmingham RCW, and were {{equipped}} with English Electric traction equipment. Each carriage featured {{two sets of}} twin air-operated sliding passenger doors, which could be opened by either the guard or the passengers using the passenger <b>operated</b> <b>buttons</b> fitted next to them, on both the outside and inside of the trains.|$|R
5000|$|Operator fatigue is an often-overlooked but crucial {{component}} when seeking maximal {{accuracy and}} repeatability. Repetitive motions cause stress in human joints and muscles. Even a well-trained and experienced operator {{will see a}} decrease in accuracy and repeatability as length {{of time on the}} job increases. It {{is for this reason that}} pipette calibration service providers that are dedicated to excellence limit the number of pipettes that can be calibrated by an individual technician to a maximum daily number. Each pipette, and each customer, deserves a high level of care in the treatment of the instrument. Additionally, some dedicated professionals train themselves to pipette ambidextrously, allowing them to reduce arm and finger strain by alternating hands. Another solution is choosing an electronic pipettor that significantly reduces hand fatigue. Once the <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> is touched the pipettor operates always the same way producing user independent accuracy and precision.|$|E

The second rotating element has a circular flange ring (24) the diameter of which is approximately {{the diameter of the}} first rotation element. USE - <b>Operating</b> <b>button</b> for an optical element, especially a microscope. ADVANTAGE - The shape and texturing of the inventive buttons ensures that careless incorrect operation is prevented, in particularly the fine focus small knob cannot be rotated inadvertently when turning the large coarse focus button...|$|E
40|$|Solid state ionic {{materials}} can be utilized in components of both solid oxide fuel cells and lithium ion batteries. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are devices used to convert chemical energy into useful electrical energy. The higher temperatures required to effectively conduct oxygen vacancies is a material limitation that prevents {{the implementation of}} this technology in today's society. Our group has developed the novel incorporation of a bilayer electrolyte utilizing the high conductivity properties of the cubic fluorite bismuth oxide material in the low temperature regime at 650 °C and below. This phase is stabilized by single and double doping of Er, Dy-W, Dy-Ce, and Dy-Gd chemistries in this study. Conductivity measurements through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy champion (Bi 0. 88 Dy 0. 08 Gd 0. 04) 2 O 3 as the most suitable electrolyte for future testing in SOFCs. Using the bilayer system in button type cells, the layer thickness ratio is optimized for highest open circuit voltage. Using neutron diffraction was used {{to better understand the}} activation energy change in conductivity in DWSB due to phase transformation that masked oxygen ordering at lower temperatures. Stabilized bismuth oxides are incorporated into a suitable composite cathode via an in-situ nano-scale mixing with La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 -&# 948;, improving the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. 	Utilizing lessons from ceramic materials synthesis in SOFCs, cathode materials for Li-ion batteries were synthesized. In previous work, LixMn 2 O 4 -yClz spinel demonstrated enhanced charge potential and discharge potential while maintaining reversibility. However the original method for synthesis was extremely cumbersome. Using the simple glycine-nitrate reaction, we could fabricate an <b>operating</b> <b>button</b> cell starting from raw powders in less than 8 hours. X-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence confirm spinel structure and maintenance of chlorine through ignition respectively. In demonstrating favorable charge/discharge performance and cyclability, we considered the benefits of B-site doping of the spinel. For the first time LixMn 2 -wFewO 4 -yClz was also easily synthesized and tested for more than 250 charge-discharge cycles with 98 % capacity retention. Similarly, Ni is introduced to the LixMn 2 O 4 -yClz spinel in order {{to take advantage of the}} intrinsic redox couple of Ni 2 +/Ni 4 + at 4. 7 V and demonstrate reversibility from 5. 0 V to 2. 0 V...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-established}} {{finding that}} people find maps {{easier to use}} when they are aligned so that "up" on the map corresponds to the user's forward direction. With map-based applications on handheld mobile devices, this forward/up correspondence can be maintained in several ways: the device can be physically rotated within the user's hands or the user can manually <b>operate</b> <b>buttons</b> to digitally rotate the map; alternatively, the map can be rotated automatically using data from an electronic compass. This paper examines all three options. In a field experiment, each method is compared against a baseline north-up condition. The study provides strong evidence that physical rotation {{is the most effective}} with applications that present the user with a wider map. The paper concludes with some suggestions for design improvements...|$|R
