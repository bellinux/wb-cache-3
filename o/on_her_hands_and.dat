5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E

NB: Due to family circumstances, this duo act {{is currently being}} performed as a solo act.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} Inuit {{myths of}} the Sun and the Moon, the sun deity Sukh-eh-nukh —known as Malina in Greenland carries an oil lamp which gets {{overturned}} spilling oil and soot <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> she blackens the face of her brother, the moon deity Ahn-ing-ah-neh (Anningan). Among the Netsilik if the people breached certain taboos, Nuliajuk, the Sea Woman, held the marine animals in the basin of her lamp. When this happened the angakkuq had to visit her to beg for game.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that she would get help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, perched in a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

60|$|Doña Mercedes rose without replying, {{and left}} the room. The lovely enthusiast dropped <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{remained}} silent, taking no notice of me, a cloud of sorrow <b>on</b> <b>her</b> countenance.|$|R
500|$|Mikami was {{indifferent}} to the main character's gender. During the early creation process, he left the decision to his staff, who ultimately chose a female character. Because P.N.03 {{takes place in a}} space colony, Mikami wanted Vanessa's country of origin to be ambiguous. To that end, she was given a combination of French, German, and English names. Vanessa's movements were animated freehand, without motion capture technology. The designers posed Vanessa crouched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees to resemble a jaguar, as an homage to the Jaguar title. The staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish. Kobayashi wanted Vanessa to be a [...] "cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past." [...] In retrospect, he was proud of the character's style and movements.|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly two}} decades, Ibuki was radically {{redesigned}} for Street Fighter V, where her main costume changes to {{a modified version}} of her schoolgirl outfit with above-knee-high socks mixed with a black mask and purple elements of traditional Japanese armour <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> legs. Before deciding on it, the designers tried many different costume ideas by adjusting the ratio of her two personalities; the rejected concept art sketches (including one with full tanuki suit) were posted on Capcom's blog. Ibuki's premium summer costume is a similarly armored swimsuit, with partial leggings and a cape-like face scarf resembling this of Capcom's own Strider Hiryu, which comes in a variety of colors. Her premium battle costume is an altogether different and more fashionable blue ninja outfit with a floral theme with a sword on her back, where {{for the first time she}} has loose hair. Her Street Fighter III look returns in the [...] "nostalgic costumes" [...] DLC.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} first {{released}} in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: [...] "The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept talking about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent." [...] Regarding the album photoshot, Gary Heery recalled: ...|$|E

60|$|John laughed, {{and watched}} her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little {{preparation}} of lace <b>and</b> flowers <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} lady, resting <b>her</b> cheek <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> gazing <b>on</b> the fire, [...] "it's all very interesting; and so odd that you two men, with {{nearly the same}} experiences, should be neighbors." ...|$|R
500|$|Bousman {{came up with}} an idea whereby a character's {{hands would}} get stuck in some sort of vessel and this {{resulted}} in the [...] "Hand Trap". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.|$|E
500|$|Known {{throughout}} Europe, Blanchard drew {{large crowds}} for her ascents. In Frankfurt she was apparently {{the cause of}} the poor reception of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Silvana on its opening night, 16 September 1810: the people of the city flocked to see her demonstration while only a few attended the opera's debut. She gave many displays in Italy. In 1811 she travelled from Rome to Naples, splitting the journey in half with a stop after 60miles (97km), and later ascended again from Rome to a height of 12,000feet (3,660m) where she claimed that she fell into a profound sleep for a while before landing at Tagliacozzo. In the same year she again lost consciousness after having to ascend to avoid being trapped in a hailstorm near Vincennes. She spent 14½ hours in the air as a result. Sophie crossed the Alps by balloon, and on a trip to Turin on 26 April 1812 the temperature dropped so low that she suffered a nose bleed and icicles formed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face. She almost died on 21 September 1817 when, on a flight from Nantes (her 53rd), she mistook a marshy field for a safe landing spot. The canopy of her balloon became caught in a tree which caused the chair to tip over; Blanchard, entangled in the rigging, was forced into the water of the marsh and would have drowned had not help arrived soon after her landing. Sympathising with Marie Thérèse de Lamourous who was attempting to run a shelter for [...] "fallen women" [...] (La Miséricorde) in Bordeaux, she offered to donate the proceeds from one of her ascents to the venture. De Lamourous refused the offer on the grounds that she could not be the cause of another risking their life.|$|E
2500|$|A November 6, 1971, cartoon in The New Yorker by Whitney Darrow, Jr. shows a {{cleaning}} lady <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: [...] "I'd {{like to see}} George Plimpton do this sometime." [...] In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient {{looks up at the}} masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, [...] "Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?" [...] A feature in Mad Magazine titled [...] "Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton" [...] spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square {{in the middle of the}} night, and spending a day with Jerry Lewis.|$|E
60|$|I got out at last {{by playing}} a game <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> I pertended to drop 'arf a dollar in the washus, and while she was busy <b>on</b> <b>'er</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees I went off as {{comfortable}} as you please.|$|R
60|$|She now {{occupied}} {{herself at}} the bookcase for nearly an hour; taking down volume after volume, and renewing her acquaintance with each. This done, she seated herself on a low stool, rested <b>her</b> cheek <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> thought, and still was mute.|$|R
6000|$|Rose leaned <b>her</b> flushed cheek <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{thought a}} minute, {{then looked up}} and {{answered}} honestly, [...] "Yes, I do, but can't explain it, except that I know something must be wrong, because I blushed and started when you came in." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged {{her head against}} a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so much, now {{we are going to}} show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses to {{instruct}} the Israelites about the test where a husband, {{in a fit}} of jealousy, accused his wife of being unfaithful — the ritual of the sotah. The man was to bring his wife to the priest, along with barley flour as a meal offering of jealousy. The priest was to dissolve some earth from the floor of the Tabernacle into some sacral water in an earthen vessel. The priest was to bare the woman's head, place the meal offering <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> adjure the woman: if innocent, to be immune to harm from the water of bitterness, but if guilty, to be cursed to have her thigh sag and belly distend. And the woman was to say, [...] "Amen, amen!" [...] The priest was to write these curses down, rub the writing off into the water of bitterness, and make the woman drink the water. The priest was to elevate the meal offering, present it on the altar, and burn a token part of it on the altar. If she had broken faith with her husband, the water would cause her belly to distend and her thigh to sag, and the woman was to become a curse among her people, but if the woman was innocent, she would remain unharmed and be able to bear children.|$|E

6000|$|She rested <b>her</b> chin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{tried to}} think out her position. But {{what was there to}} think out, seeing that nature and law and custom have conspired {{together}} to put women altogether under the power of jealous and acquisitive men? ...|$|R

6000|$|Violet {{sat with}} <b>her</b> {{forehead}} resting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was a}} short space of thoughtful silence.

6000|$|She rested <b>her</b> little chin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{reflected}} a minute. [...] "Does it occur to you," [...] she asked at last, [...] "that people have tongues? If {{you go on}} following me like this, they will really begin to talk about us." ...|$|R
