Secondly, this paper sharpens the general bounds for the case of (symmetric) pupil functions that either decrease or increase {{as a function of}} the distance to the origin. Special attention is paid to the role in these bounds of the constant pupil function. Thirdly, this paper presents bounds for a particular form of superresolution in which a non-linear screen material is used, where the non-linearity is due to thermal effects.

40|$|Conventional imaging {{devices are}} often {{compared}} using their <b>optical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> (OTFs) {{in space and}} their impulse responses in time. Modulated polarimeters cannot be directly compared this way, since they are frequency multiplexed. Here we define a spectral density response function that describes how the spectral density matrix of the Stokes parameters for an object transfers through a modulated polarimeter. This response function facilitates the objective comparison of polarimeters {{in a way that}} is analogous to the OTF for conventional imaging systems. The spectral density response is used to calculate a Wiener filter for a rotating analyzer polarimeter as an example of filter optimization for modulated polarimetry...|$|R

As the result we present the noise spectral density of a Michelson interferometer with Kerr nonlinear arm cavities and resonant sideband extraction and find that quantum noise can be squeezed by arbitrary amounts even outside the cavity linewidth. Such a system might apply for future gravitational wave detectors or simply for a continuous wave source of squeezed states...|$|R
50|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> {{is defined}} as the Fourier {{transform}} of the impulse-response of the optical system, also called the point spread function. The <b>optical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is thus readily obtained by first acquiring the image of a point source, and applying the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform to the sampled image. Such a point-source can, for example, be a bright light behind a screen with a pin hole, a fluorescent or metallic microsphere, or simply a dot painted on a screen. Calculation of the <b>optical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> via the point spread function is versatile as it can fully characterize optics with spatial varying and chromatic aberrations by repeating the procedure for various positions and wavelength spectra of the point source.|$|E

A diagram of a typical 4F correlator is shown in the figure below (click to enlarge). This device may be readily understood by combining the plane wave spectrum representation of the electric field (section 2) with the Fourier transforming property of quadratic lenses (section 5.1) to yield the optical image processing operations described in section 4.|$|R

50|$|A perfect lens {{system will}} provide a high {{contrast}} projection without shifting the periodic pattern, hence the <b>optical</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> {{is identical to the}} modulation transfer function.

40|$|Two-photon {{microscopy}} {{is often}} performed at slow frame rates {{due to the}} need to serially scan all points in a field of view with a single laser beam. To overcome this problem, we have developed two optical methods that split and multiplex a laser beam across the sample. In the first method a diffractive optical element (DOE) generates a fixed number of beamlets that are scanned in parallel resulting in a corresponding increase in speed or in signal-to-noise ratio in time-lapse measurements. The second method uses a computer-controlled spatial light modulator (SLM) to generate any arbitrary spatio-temporal light pattern. With an SLM one can image or photostimulate any predefined region of the image such as neurons or dendritic spines.
