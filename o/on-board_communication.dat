50|$|Commercial EDWA {{development}} efforts intensified in 2000's when Inplane Photonics joined the race. In general, their approach {{was similar to}} that of Bell Labs, i.e. the silica-on-silicon technology. Inplane Photonics, however, was able to further improve and expand capabilities of this technology by integrating two to three different waveguide types on the same chip. This feature allowed them to monolithically integrate gain blocks (active waveguides providing amplification) with different passive elements, such as couplers, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG), optical taps, turning mirrors and so on. Some of advanced Inplane Photonics' photonic circuits containing EDWAs were used by Lockheed Martin in their development of new high-speed <b>on-board</b> <b>communication</b> systems for the US Air Force. Inplane Photonics and its technology was later acquired by CyOptics.|$|E

The firing unit incorporated two Standard Vehicle-Mounted Launcher (SVML) missile pods, a [...]50 caliber machine gun, Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), Laser Range Finder (LRF), and IFF capability. The fully rotating, gyro-stabilized turret was mounted on the M1097 heavy High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).

It is the standard that is adopted in new civilian & military aircraft (circuit routing and device mounting) and all the software in the Agni-II has been designed around this bus. DRDO sources claim that this reduces the number of connections and also makes the missile more rugged. However, some missile analysts feel that a standard databus {{may not be the}} best path to follow. It is said that a customised databus is better because in a standard databus, one tends to use off-the-shelf electronic devices whose performance may not be optimal. However most new missiles are moving towards digital buses using commercial off-the-shelf technology and which enables affordable sub-system replacement.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{surveillance}} plane, Sébastien Lefebvre conceives {{of the plane}} {{as an alternative to}} drone UAVs, the latter being costly to operate, especially near airports. The Ellipse aims to [...] "deliver 80% of the range of drone missions for 20% of the cost". The potential of the plane for surveillance and military missions led the investment fund Magellan Industries to become a shareholder in LH Aviation. The Ellipse was thus further developed in collaboration with Thales as a modular platform for civilian and military missions with different equipment systems, including day and night vision, rocket launching, and <b>on-board</b> <b>communication</b> systems.The LH-10 Ellipse is a low-wing, tandem two-seat light kit aircraft, powered by a 100 hp Rotax petrol engine in a pusher-propeller configuration. Its low weight and unusual configuration is designed to deliver a very high cruising speed with exceptional fuel economy. This high speed and a relatively high 50-knot stall speed will exclude it from the UK Microlight or United States LSA categories, so a full single-engine private pilot certificate will be the minimum certification requirement to fly it in these countries, which are not the immediate target of the manufacturer, anyway. At the 2008 Farnborough Airshow LH-Aviation said that for the future they would be looking into LSA/ELA compliant production, possibly for the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{research}} {{topic that}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular is that of <b>on-board</b> mobile <b>communication,</b> where users on a vehicle are connected to a local network that attaches to the Internet via a mobile router and a wireless link. However, wireless data transmission is less efficient, prone to error and unreliable in a mobile environment. There {{is a need to}} make use of multiple access links simultaneously (so-called multihoming), to improve the aggregate bandwidth and the overall service availability on a mobile network. In this paper, we introduce a novel on-board Multihoming Agent for supporting the future on-board multihomed mobile routers. The Multihoming Agent can intelligently stripe user traffics into multiple active WAN interfaces based on the policy in use and the real-time network status and automatically shift user traffics from unavailable links to available ones. We show that by properly deploying the policies defined in the Policy Database and continuously collecting network status, a user can run intelligent load distribution algorithms on top of the mobile router to improve network performance and reliability via our Multihoming Agent.

40|$|Abstract—A {{research}} {{area that has}} become increasingly important {{in recent years is}} that of <b>on-board</b> mobile <b>communication,</b> where users on a vehicle are connected to a local network that attaches to the Internet via a mobile router and a wireless link. In this architecture, link disruptions (e. g., due to signal degradation) may have an immediate impact on a potentially large number of connections. We argue that the advance knowledge of public transport routes, and their repetitive nature, allows a certain degree of prediction of impending link disruptions, which can be used to offset their catastrophic impact. Focusing on the transmission control protocol (TCP) and its extension known as Freeze-TCP, we present a detailed analysis of the performance improvement of TCP connections in the presence of disruption prediction. In particular, we propose a Markov model of Freeze-TCP that captures both the TCP behavior and the prediction+“freezing ” feature and, using simulations, show that it accurately predicts the performance of the protocol. Our results demonstrate the significant throughput improvement that can be gained by disruption prediction, even with random packet losses or imperfect timing of the predicted disruptions.

Because {{of the necessity}} of profound technical knowledge and smart as well as cost efficient diagnostic tools for garages, Bayreuth University and Fraunhofer IPA pick up the challenge and develop innovative service-processes for future requirements by the project "Kfz-Service Engineering 2020 ". In order to improve established service-processes and develop new service processes a wide variety of service cases had been inspected in garages.

Future service cases of vehicles amongst others are in the context of electronic diagnostics, control units, electro mobility and automotive lightweight construction.

This teamwork takes place in a highly complex environment and requires clear communication, leadership and decision-making. When viewed as a whole, the `seafarers and the technical systems that enable control of the vessel are knows as a ‘Joint Cognitive System’ (JCS). To operate successfully, the members of the JCS (both human and technical) must develop a Shared Mental Model (SMM), whereby roles are understood and team members are supported with timely and appropriate communication. Of particular importance is the SMM that is developed between the bridge team and the engineering team. This results from the lack of physical proximity between the bridge and machinery spaces and a cultural legacy that limits <b>on-board</b> <b>communication,</b> particularly between these teams. By taking an information-centric approach, this study will establish a preliminary context of use for a prototype system to support the development of a SMM between bridge and engineering teams...|$|E
