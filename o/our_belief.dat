25|$|Francis sees in journeying {{together}} to shrines a thirst for God and a working of the Spirit. They {{enable us to}} witness to <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> and to feel {{a part of the}} Church. Bringing one's children or inviting others is an evangelizing gesture (EG 122-6).|$|E
25|$|This would {{reconcile}} the contradiction between <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in {{the certainty of}} abstract deductions and the empiricist principle that knowledge comes from observation of individual instances. We know that Euler's equation is true because every time a human mind derives the equation, it gets the same result, unless it has made a mistake, which can be acknowledged and corrected. We observe this phenomenon, and we extrapolate to the general proposition that it is always true.|$|E
40|$|Are we {{responsible}} for <b>our</b> <b>beliefs?</b> This is not - just - {{the question whether}} we can be culpably ignorant; if we can be morally {{responsible for}} <b>our</b> <b>beliefs,</b> then we might also be praiseworthy for some of them. Examining {{the extent to which}} we can be responsible for <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> promises to deepen our notion of moral responsibility, and to illuminate not just morality but also epistemology...|$|R
5000|$|Quine's {{naturalized}} epistemology {{in brief}} {{is the view}} that instead of traditional attempts to connect how <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> relate to evidence, epistemology should focus upon how experience leads to beliefs: the causal connections between our sensory evidence and <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> about the world[...]|$|R
40|$|What is the {{relation}} between <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> or thoughts {{in general and the}} perceptual experience of the world that gives rise to those beliefs. Donald Davidson is taken to have a well-known answer to this question that runs as follows: while <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> are at least in part, caused by our experience, such experience does not thereby count as providing a rational ground for those beliefs; <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> are evidently ground in other belief but not in the experience that gives rise to them...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what {{many of us have}} been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E
500|$|President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, Max Justicz, {{said of the}} {{previous}} year's race: [...] "We were burned on that day. Badly burned. It was worse than other defeats because {{we thought we could}} win ... Oxford just rowed through us; with every stroke they took they destroyed <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in ourselves." [...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down and get on with the job. [...] We know that if we don't cross the line first on the day, nobody could care less who we are." ...|$|E
40|$|What {{we believe}} {{and what we}} do not believe has a great impact on what we do and fail to do. Hence, if we want to act responsibly, we should believe responsibly. However, do we have the kind of control over <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> that such {{responsibility}} for <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> seems to require? If not, can we maybe influence what we believe by performing actions that make a difference to what we believe? Do we have certain obligations to control or influence <b>our</b> <b>beliefs</b> on particular occasions? And do we sometimes believe responsibly despite violating such obligations, namely because we are excused for violating our obligations with regard to <b>our</b> <b>beliefs?</b> By answering each of these questions, this book provides an account of what it is to believe responsibly...|$|R

500|$|On 23 July, the {{day after}} leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in it!" [...] In the {{succeeding}} days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although {{by the end of}} July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.|$|E
500|$|The Herald Sun {{reported}} that [...] "those who found [...] {{weighed down by}} emotional gravity and over-the-top spiritualism [...] the follow-up with its suspense, action and subtle good humor." [...] The dialogue and banter was considered a positive and defining aspect of the film; Janet Maslin of The New York Times said that [...] "Star Trek VI is definitely colorful, but even more of its color comes from conversation, which can take some amusingly florid turns." [...] Critic Hal Hinson commented that Meyer [...] " [...] capable of sending up his material without cheapening it or disrupting <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in the reality of his yarn," [...] and called the one-liners an organic part of the film's [...] "jocular, tongue-in-cheek spirit". Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said that with Meyer directing, [...] "this last mission gets almost everything right—from the nod to late creator Gene Roddenberry to in-jokes about Kirk's rep as an alien babe magnet." ...|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{expressed}} {{the view that}} [...] "South Africa's future foreign relations [...] be based on <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> that human rights should be the core of international relations". Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the [...] "narrow, chauvinistic interests" [...] of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, {{for which he was}} criticised by both Israel and India. Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} April they {{observed}} the tracks of an Arctic fox, the first trace they had seen of a living creature other than their dogs since leaving Fram. Soon they began to see bear tracks, {{and by the end}} of May seals, gulls and whales were in evidence. On 31 May, by Nansen's calculations, they were only [...] from Cape Fligely, the northernmost known point of Franz Josef Land. However, travel conditions worsened as the warmer weather caused the ice to break up. On 22 June the pair decided to rest on a stable ice floe while they repaired their equipment and gathered their strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained on the floe for a month. The day after leaving this camp Nansen recorded: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> in it!" [...] Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know—they had only a rough sketch map to guide them. On 6 August they reached the edge of the ice, where they shot the last of their dogs—they had been killing the weakest regularly since 24 April, to feed the others. They then lashed their two kayaks together, raised a sail and made for the land.|$|E
500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter {{than the rest of}} the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be no mistake about <b>our</b> <b>belief</b> that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".|$|E
