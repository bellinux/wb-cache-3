5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{attempts}} to prove {{life in an}} office is dangerous after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) berates him about the dangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse.</b> The attempts lead him {{to the roof of}} the building, where he tries to show that depression caused by an office can lead to desperate circumstances. Meanwhile, gambling between the other employees of the office leads Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to discover that she is still an outsider.|$|E
5|$|KSE's lease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> was {{terminated}} in 1999. KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit, while moving the three unregistered units to an unused car park in Bangkok's Prawet District, which {{was owned by}} its parent company. The car park was fenced, but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas. KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit, but {{did not mention the}} other three, which remained orphan sources.|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis named „The Study of Warehousing Processes in a Manufacturing Company“is aimed on <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehousing</b> {{processes}} and <b>the</b> current method <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storage {{in the manufacturing}} company.

50|$|A $9 million {{claim was}} brought against <b>the</b> Lawrence <b>Warehouse</b> Company {{following}} its May 16, 1963, acquisition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehousing</b> facilities <b>of</b> {{a subsidiary of}} American Express Company, American Express Field <b>Warehousing</b> Corporation. Although <b>the</b> American Express subsidiary was absorbed by <b>the</b> Lawrence <b>Warehouse</b> Company, salad oil storage facilities in Bayonne, New Jersey, were exempted from the agreement. Ironically the claim brought against a unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawrence <b>Warehouse</b> Company was founded on a $150 million allegation of non-existent oil, purportedly stored in tanks in Bayonne.|$|R
30|$|The {{modeling}} {{process begins}} with <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> fifteen scenarios {{based on the}} common basic network data. Then, <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> are located, and customers are allocated for each scenario through <b>the</b> optimization <b>of</b> transport costs. <b>The</b> optimization <b>of</b> transport costs is a two-step process. First, <b>the</b> geographical location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> on a continuous solution space and <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> customers are solved by <b>the</b> minimization <b>of</b> outbound transport cost with a heuristics based on Stolletz and Stolletz [35]. Therefore, the total demand is divided geographically into as many regions as warehouses are modeled. Each warehouse is located at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity of its demand region, considering the throughput to each customer weighted with the variable outbound transport costs, which are calculated on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a given delivery frequency and the oil price–dependent transport tariffs. Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> {{are linked to the}} source network through direct transports, and both a delivery frequency and a transport tariff are defined for each of them. Therefore, a subsequent mathematical optimization minimizes the total transport costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network, including inbound and outbound transport costs, by <b>the</b> possible relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouses.</b> Thus, higher inbound transport costs lead to <b>the</b> relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> near to <b>the</b> source, while higher outbound costs to their relocation near the customers.|$|R
5|$|The {{architect}} of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> (1831) then extended {{it to the}} north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse.</b> The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the entire warehouse staff quits after winning the lottery, leaving Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) to scramble for replacements while Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) temporarily get a taste <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> life.|$|E

50|$|By <b>the</b> mid-2000s, <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> {{had been}} under a threat of {{demolition}} {{for almost a decade}} {{to make way for a}} new Helsinki Music Centre concert hall.

5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse.</b> The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make their way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

5|$|Funded by a Derelict Land Grant, the {{engineering}} consultants Binnies {{carried out a}} feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative structure for the project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures of the canal, campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding for the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> and the former offices of the canal company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal. The former seed warehouse now forms part of The Hub, housing the National Centre for Craft and Design, which {{is supported by the}} Arts Council {{and is one of the}} leading centres for the promotion and exhibition of international craft and design in the UK.|$|E
5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse,</b> visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

50|$|For much <b>of</b> Sebring's history, <b>the</b> track {{followed}} a 5.2 mi layout.

This {{was closer to}} the hairpin and allowed a flat-out run through a very fast corner to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track and the runway. Another dangerous section was <b>the</b> <b>Warehouse</b> straight, where <b>the</b> organizers installed a chicane to move the track away from <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> and buildings after a crash where a Porsche went into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouses</b> and into a crowd.|$|R
