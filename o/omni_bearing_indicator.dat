Similarly, the aircraft will track directly away from the NDB if the needle is maintained on the 180 degree mark. With a crosswind, the needle must be maintained to the left or right of the 0 or 180 position by an amount corresponding to the drift due to the crosswind.

The characterization was done by means of severity indicators derived from the rotor behavior within the backup <b>bearings.</b> The <b>indicator</b> is a quantitative value {{that can be used to}} compare different delevitation events. The indicator presented in this paper is the non-dimensionalised velocity of the geometric center of the rotor (Vval). This indicator only requires the rotational speed and position data of the rotor to determine the Vval quantity. This ensures that this value can be determined for most current operational systems and on historical data logged from previous rotor delevitation events. In order to validate Vval, a comparison was done between simulated and experimental rotor drops and their associated Vval values. The model used to produce the simulation results is BBSim.

40|$|Currently, {{the wind}} energy {{industry}} is swiftly changing its maintenance strategy from schedule based maintenance to predictive based maintenance. Condition monitoring systems (CMS) {{play an important}} role in the predictive maintenance cycle. As condition monitoring systems are being adopted by more and more OEM and O&M service providers from the wind energy industry, it is crucial to effectively interpret the data generated by the CMS and initiate proactive processes to efficiently reduce the risk of potential component or system failure which often leads to down tower repair or gearbox replacement.

Anomaly detection in the frequency domain is implemented by monitoring the fault <b>indicator</b> <b>bearing</b> frequencies and harmonics, calculated using the bearing dimensions and number of rotor revolutions.

Compliance was monitored by means of the sensor for an average of 8 months. Of the patients, 14 were informed that their appliance was fitted with a monitoring sensor, and 16 were not. The psychological maturity of all patients was assessed on the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale, and the effect on compliance of this score as well as the patient- and treatment-related variables considered were determined via statistical analysis Results: The mean compliance recorded by the chips was 8. 6 ± 2. 9 hours, far lower than the 13 hours prescribed, and younger patients showed significantly greater compliance than adolescents (P <. 01). However, no significant differences in compliance were found between intra- and extraoral appliances, and neither gender, psychological scores, treatment duration, nor awareness of being monitored had any significant effect. Conclusions: Compliance is generally very poor in young patients, regardless of their gender and psychological maturity.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 12 During the {{conceptual}} {{development of a}} subsea motor-compressor prototype running on active magnetic bearings, the emergency landing on the catcher bearings {{was identified as a}} potential technology gap. This is because the rotor in object is vertical and supercritical. A subscale simulator was then developed with the twofold aim to collect useful experimental data for data matching with a numerical simulation (also developed for this special application) and to perform endurance testing of the catcher bearings to understand their mechanical limits. The selected scale factor was one-third in order to utilize standard size active magnetic bearings and meet the project schedule. The subscale rotor design was aimed to respect the dynamic similitude with the real machine having the same separation between the rotor critical speeds and the operating speed range. Maximum test rig rotor speed is 30, 000 rpm. Moreover the test rig casing design simulated also the real casing dynamic behavior. The test campaign was then divided in two steps. During the first step a test matrix was defined to address all the potential important parameters in the landing dynamics: unbalance magnitude, unbalance distribution (to excite different modes), rotation speed at drop start, duration of the delevitation, type of axes to be deleviated and active magnetic bearings (AMBs) cooling medium. Overall 19 tests were performed. The main outcomes from the test were: The rotor always showed a forward cylindrical subsynchronous whirl; The whirl behavior was not affected by unbalance level and distribution, landing duration, or drop speed; The whirl frequency is not related to any rotor/casing natural frequencies. The numerical simulation was developed in a numerical computing environment software specifically for the test rig system and was tuned {{on the basis of the}} experimental results. A key factor in model tuning was the introduction of a cross coupled term to allow the rotor to follow a forward whirling motion since the beginning of the drop. The physical nature of this cross- coupled force is still to be exactly identified. The final simulation results well matched with the experimental data both in whirling direction and frequency. Afterward the simulation was extended to the full-scale machine to predict landing behavior during the future full load testing and operation. Simulation shows the machine is stable for nominal conditions and the stability margin is greater than two. Moreover catcher bearing loads are within allowable limits. Finally a sensitivity study was performed showing that decreasing catcher bearings clearances and reducing seal entry swirl will lead to improved stability margin and dynamic loads. A second step of testing was the endurance test of the catcher bearings to determine the maximum number of landing. For this purpose the same drop speed (30 krpm) and landing duration (10 sec) was used for all the test runs. Several catcher <b>bearings</b> damage <b>indicators</b> were experienced; finally it was evident that the most reliable indications came from the accelerometers mounted on the bearing housing. The endurance test lead to the conclusion that the current design of catcher bearings for this rotor configuration allows at least seven safe drops from full speed in conditions, which can be considered similar or even more severe than the real machine scenario...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{reliability}} and efficiency of rotating machinery are central problems in many application domains, such as energy production and transportation. This requires efficient condition monitoring methods, including analytics needed to predict and detect faults and manage the high volume and velocity of data. Rolling element bearings are essential components of rotating machines, which are particularly important to monitor due to the high requirements on the operational conditions. Bearings are also located near the rotating parts of the machines and thereby the signal sources that characterize faults and abnormal operational conditions. Thus, bearings with embedded sensing, analysis and communication capabilities are developed.   However, the analysis of signals from bearings and the surrounding components is a challenging problem due to the high variability {{and complexity of the}} systems. For example, machines evolve over time due to wear and maintenance, and the operational conditions typically also vary over time. Furthermore, the variety of fault signatures and failure mechanisms makes it difficult to derive generally useful and accurate models, which enable early detection of faults at reasonable cost. Therefore, investigations of machine learning methods that avoid some of these difficulties by automated on-line adaptation of the signal model are motivated. In particular, can unsupervised feature learning methods be used to automatically derive useful information about the state and operational conditions of a rotating machine? What additional methods are needed to recognize normal operational conditions and detect abnormal conditions, for example in terms of learned features or changes of model parameters?   Condition monitoring systems are typically based on condition indicators that are pre-defined by experts, such as the amplitudes in certain frequency bands of a vibration signal, or the temperature of a <b>bearing.</b> Condition <b>indicators</b> are used to define alarms in terms of thresholds; when the indicator is above (or below) the threshold, an alarm indicating a fault condition is generated, without further information about the root cause of the fault. Similarly, machine learning methods and labeled datasets are used to train classifiers {{that can be used for}} the detection of faults. The accuracy and reliability of such condition monitoring methods depends on the type of condition indicators used and the data considered when determining the model parameters. Hence, this approach can be challenging to apply in the field where machines and sensor systems are different and change over time, and parameters have different meaning depending on the conditions. Adaptation of the model parameters to each condition monitoring application and operational condition is also difficult due to the need for labeled training data representing all relevant conditions, and the high cost of manual configuration. Therefore, neither of these solutions is viable in general.   In this thesis I investigate unsupervised methods for feature learning and anomaly detection, which can operate online without pre-training with labeled datasets. Concepts and methods for validation of normal operational conditions and detection of abnormal operational conditions based on automatically learned features are proposed and studied. In particular, dictionary learning is applied to vibration and acoustic emission signals obtained from laboratory experiments and condition monitoring systems. The methodology is based on the assumption that signals can be described as a linear superposition of noise and learned atomic waveforms of arbitrary shape, amplitude and position. Greedy sparse coding algorithms and probabilistic gradient methods are used to learn dictionaries of atomic waveforms enabling sparse representation of the vibration and acoustic emission signals. As a result, the model can adapt automatically to different machine configurations, and environmental and operational conditions with a minimum of initial configuration. In addition, sparse coding results in reduced data rates that can simplify the processing and communication of information in resource-constrained systems.   Measures that can be used to detect anomalies in a rotating machine are introduced and studied, like the dictionary distance between an online propagated dictionary and a set of dictionaries learned when the machine is known to operate in healthy conditions. In addition, the possibility to generalize a dictionary learned from the vibration signal in one machine to another similar machine is studied in the case of wind turbines.   The main contributions of this thesis are the extension of unsupervised dictionary learning to condition monitoring for anomaly detection purposes, and the related case studies demonstrating that the learned features can be used to obtain information about the condition. The cases studies include vibration signals from controlled ball bearing experiments and wind turbines; and acoustic emission signals from controlled tensile strength tests and bearing contamination experiments. It is found that the dictionary distance between an online propagated dictionary and a baseline dictionary trained in healthy conditions can increase up to three times when a fault appears, without reference to kinematic information like defect frequencies. Furthermore, it is found that in the presence of a bearing defect, impulse-like waveforms with center frequencies that are about two times higher than in the healthy condition are learned. In the case of acoustic emission analysis, it is shown that the representations of signals of different strain stages of stainless steel appear as distinct clusters. Furthermore, the repetition rates of learned acoustic emission waveforms are found to be markedly different for a bearing with and without particles in the lubricant, especially at high rotational speed above 1000 rpm, where particle contaminants are difficult to detect using conventional methods. Different hyperparameters are investigated and it is found that the model is useful for anomaly detection with as little as 2. 5 % preserved coefficients...|$|R
