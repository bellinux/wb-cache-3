25|$|The {{amplification}} {{window of}} an <b>optical</b> <b>amplifier</b> is {{the range of}} optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain.

It can be potentially {{less expensive than}} the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high nonlinearity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and four wave mixing) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.|$|E

25|$|An {{optical fiber}} doped with certain rare-earth {{elements}} such as erbium {{can be used as}} the gain medium of a laser or <b>optical</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal amplification by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is optically pumped with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is stimulated emission.|$|E

An <b>optical</b> <b>amplifier</b> may {{be thought of as}} a laser without an optical cavity, or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in optical communication and laser physics. [...] An important practical goal is to develop an amplifier adequate for use as an optical repeater in the long distance fiberoptic cables which carry much of the world's telecommunication links. Existing fiberoptic repeaters must convert the light beam to an electronic signal to amplify it, then convert it back to light.|$|E

2500|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} multiplexer. [...] The terminal multiplexer {{contains a}} wavelength-converting transponder for each data signal, an optical multiplexer and where necessary an <b>optical</b> <b>amplifier</b> (EDFA). Each wavelength-converting transponder receives an optical data {{signal from the}} client-layer, such as Synchronous optical networking [...] or another type of data signal, converts this signal into the electrical domain and re-transmits the signal at a specific wavelength using a 1,550nm band laser. These data signals are then combined together into a multi-wavelength optical signal using an optical multiplexer, for transmission over a single fiber (e.g., SMF-28 fiber). The terminal multiplexer {{may or may not}} also include a local transmit EDFA for power amplification of the multi-wavelength optical signal. In the mid-1990s DWDM systems contained 4 or 8 wavelength-converting transponders; by 2000 or so, commercial systems capable of carrying 128 signals were available.|$|E
