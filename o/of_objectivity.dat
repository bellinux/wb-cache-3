5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b>|$|E

Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} with the question <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted {{that the importance of}} subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the problem <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity,</b> which is constituted by the ontological, epistemological and motivational challenges. It gradually develops an account <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity</b> {{that has the}} dual function {{of dealing with the}} enemies <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity</b> as well as giving a positive account <b>of</b> what moral <b>objectivity</b> is. It establishes these aims by arguing for the following theses. The first set of arguments show that relativist theories of ethics provide us with no forceful grounds for being sceptical about moral objectivity. The second set of arguments deepens the response to those who are sceptical about moral objectivity. It does so by showing in greater detail how rationality plays a substantive role in our practical deliberation, our notion of agency as well as our reactive attitudes. These arguments provide further reasons why we should have faith in the possibility of developing an adequate account <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity.</b> The last set of arguments provides the positive account <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity.</b> This positive account ends with the discussion of a paradigmatic moral fact that gives full expression (to the features <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity</b> that have been articulated and defended...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} claimed by theorists of truth that truth is objective. Upon reflection, however, this {{familiar}} principle {{can be understood}} in multiple ways. With this in mind, we have conducted empirical studies designed to elicit people’s responses to questions about the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> truth. These studies suggest the following: (1) overall, individuals tend to endorse claims {{that are consistent with}} the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> truth; (2) individuals’ conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> truth can be importantly different from one another; (3) philosophers and non-philosophers both endorse the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> truth, but the apparent commitment of philosophers is stronger...|$|R
40|$|Subjectivists {{claim that}} the absence of a {{theological}} or metaphysical grounding to moral judgements renders them all as simply statements about our subjective wants and preferences. Leslie Allan argues that the subjectivists' case rests on a misunderstanding of the nature <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity.</b> He presents the view that subjectivists mistakenly counterpoise the ideal <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity</b> with the expression of individual preferences. Being objective in moral deliberation, Allan argues, should be regarded instead as the antithesis of parochial and biased reasoning. This account <b>of</b> moral <b>objectivity,</b> he concludes, makes sense of a long-standing universalist tradition in moral philosophy...|$|R

40|$|The Great East Japan Earthquake was {{a tragic}} event {{requiring}} critical media involvement. Since the media {{played an important}} role in conveying factual information, journalists expressed feeling that it was difficult to guarantee the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> their coverage. As media coverage constructs a socio-culturally shared reality among its audience, an examination <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> and emotionality <b>of</b> the contents of the news coverage is needed. In Study 1, we conducted an exploratory content analysis of TV and newspaper coverage from the six month period following the March 11, 2011 disaster, finding that the news media generally reported neutral and objective factual information about the event, with emotionality shown only in the commentary. In order to examine how media coverage was constructed and evaluated by journalists, in Study 2 we conducted an online survey of 115 journalists working for mass media organizations. We found that that the journalists' orientations tended to be more objective than emotional, which is consistent with the findings of Study 1. However, their evaluations <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> the published articles were low, especially for the coverage of the nuclear power plant accident, which was an accident of an unprecedented nature. The negative emotions that journalists experienced during their investigations negatively affected subsequent evaluations <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> their reporting...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{whether there}} are objectively true answers to ontological questions. Traditionally, ontological questions are taken to be significant to philosophers: to give those questions firm answers is typically {{the first step in}} establishing a metaphysical system or even a philosophical system. However, recently, more and more philosophers have questioned whether ontological statements really present objective truths about the world. Given that it is widely received that ontology might be the center of metaphysics, to answer this question is therefore very important. In chapter 1, I present some major worries about the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> ontological statements and some important theories in the contemporary literature addressing those worries. In chapter 2, I analyze those theories in detail and suggest that none of them gives a completely satisfactory account <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> ontology. My positive proposal, raised in chapter 3, is that <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> discourses comes in degrees and that we can assess it according to a reasonably comprehensive set of criteria. In chapter 4, I apply those criteria in the assessment of the discourse of ontology. I reached two major conclusions: (a), Euthyphro Contrast, Cognitive Command and Data Sensitivity are the plausible criteria <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> discourses; (b), since ontological discourse does not strongly exhibit any of those marks, the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> ontological discourse is very weak...|$|R

These instruments bring a degree <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and consistency to the clinical assessment. More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist, for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, to detect intellectual impairment or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child's difficulties.|$|E
25|$|The act {{established}} a Review Tribunal—composed of a judge, a magistrate, and a Native Commissioner—to review annually {{the case of}} each detainee and recommend release or continued detention. Tribunal proceedings were held in camera; deliberations depended heavily on {{the evidence of the}} police Special Branch; and the minister was not obliged to follow the tribunal's recommendations. The tribunal rarely advised the release of detainees, and its lack <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> was reflected in its general report on the emergency and detention exercise of 1959, which completely whitewashed the regime's actions. These provisions were widely seen as window dressing to provide legitimacy to the suspension of habeas corpus without any real Judicial Review.|$|E
25|$|After AD 596, {{documentary}} {{sources that}} Bede {{took pains to}} obtain throughout England and from Rome are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed along with critical consideration of its authenticity. This is impressive; nevertheless, the Historia, like other historical writing from this period has a lower degree <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> than modern historical writings. It {{seems to be a}} mixture of fact, legend and literature. For example, Bede quotes at length some speeches by people who were not his contemporaries and whose speeches do not appear in any other surviving source; it is doubtful whether oral traditional history supported these ostensible quotations.|$|E

40|$|Most {{management}} researchers pause at {{the threshold}} of objective right and wrong. Their hesitation is understandable.

In this article we invite management researchers to rethink this presumption.
