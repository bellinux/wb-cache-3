25|$|The {{idea behind}} such emergency-braking {{indicator}} systems is to catch following drivers' attention with special urgency. However, there remains considerable {{debate over whether}} the system offers a measurable increase in safety performance. To date, studies of vehicles in service have not shown significant improvement. The systems used by BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes differ not only in <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> (growing vs. intensifying vs. flashing, respectively), but also in such parameters as deceleration threshold of activation. Data are being collected and analyzed {{in an effort to}} determine how such a system might be implemented to maximise a safety benefit, if such a benefit can be realised with visual emergency braking displays. An experimental study at the University of Toronto has tested stop lights which gradually and continuously grow in illuminated area with increasing braking.|$|E

2500|$|During the Cold War, WE.177A bombs, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use as depth charges (though able to be delivered in any <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> by the Sea Harrier FRS1), were routinely carried on some Royal Navy warships, and the associated Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) replenishment ships. [...] They were kept in containers that were designed to float if they {{ended up in the}} sea. [...] In 1982, with the outbreak of the Falklands War, some of these vessels were urgently assigned to the Naval Task Force, and began to steam south with their nuclear weapons still on board. [...] The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said that, en route, the bombs were offloaded from escort vessels , , , and and were stored in the better-protected deep magazines aboard , and the fleet replenishment ships Fort Austin, Regent, Resource, and Fort Grange who were accompanying the Task Force. [...] Coventry and Sheffield were both later destroyed by enemy action near the Falkland Islands.|$|E

40|$|Runtime {{variability}} {{is becoming}} an attractive technique to support those runtime scenarios for systems that demand some kind of autonomous reconfiguration or adaptive behavior. Nowadays, the challenge of many critical systems that need to handle different <b>operational</b> <b>modes,</b> often in an unattended mode, require specific solutions for which runtime variability mechanisms become relevant. This research describes the challenges of runtime variability to support multiple binding modes for handling the diversity of different <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> and runtime reconfiguration needs.

50|$|Although limited, {{the service}} {{experience}} of the Type 61 proved that the semi-automatic <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> design was reliable and the manual <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> was not needed. In 1965, the Type 65 model was released without a manual <b>operational</b> <b>mode,</b> and series production was scheduled to begin in the following year. Like its predecessor, though, the planned series production of Type 65 also suffered from political turmoil, {{this time in the}} form of the Cultural Revolution. As with Type 61, Type 65 only entered Chinese service in very limited numbers. It did see action in real battles, but not against foreign enemies: during the fractional fighting among Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, Guards in Sichuan seized the Type 65 guns from the production factory and used the guns in battles against each other.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} Dynamic Positioning {{shows that in}} most {{incidents}} the DP operator is involved. Reducing the amount of operator related DP incidents could therefore significantly increase the safety and reliability of DP operations. An operator’s workload during DP operations {{seems to be the}} most important cause of operator errors. By splitting DP operations into three different <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> this workload problem could be resolved such that the operator’s performance will improve. To allow for this split in <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> a self-diagnostics system and an operator support function should be added to a DP system.

Rocking-Mass Gyroscope (RMG) is a dual-axial {{symmetry}} vibrating mass gyroscope, whose <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> {{are completely}} uniform, {{and values of}} frequency are equal.
