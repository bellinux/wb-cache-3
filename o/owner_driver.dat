2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the <b>owner</b> <b>driver,</b> (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

50|$|The 20/25 {{engine and}} chassis was {{designed}} for the <b>owner</b> <b>driver</b> market - ideally fitted with a smaller sedan or coupe body as the one used in the 1935 Autocar Test.

50|$|Seeking to {{minimise}} their costs, {{many large}} companies increased {{their use of}} <b>owner</b> <b>drivers</b> to avoid paying award rates of pay to employee drivers. These subcontractors, increasingly discovered they lacked the bargaining power of employee drivers. Forced to negotiate individually with the large prime contractors, they found themselves progressively squeezed throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s as operating costs rose far more than rates. For {{the first time since}} the 1880s, <b>owner</b> <b>drivers</b> joined the union in large numbers. They had quickly found the TWU was the only serious industrial force that could stand up to the transport conglomerates.|$|R
50|$|When NASCAR {{started in}} the late 1940s nearly all drivers owned their cars and would drive their car to the track. While {{sponsorship}} was useful, it was not essential to win at this time, leaving less burden for the driver. But by the 1970s and '80s more and more drivers drove for another team. From 1980 to now, {{with the exception of}} Alan Kulwicki and Tony Stewart (1992 and 2011) no NASCAR champion was an <b>owner</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E

Again the competition was tough, especially in the windy confines of San Francisco's city front. The team and USA 76 won both events.|$|E
50|$|After {{wrecking}} {{his primary}} {{car in the}} first practice Saturday, Tony Stewart {{was sent to the}} back of the field as a result of bringing out his back-up car. However, he overcame that and used the old fuel mileage strategy trick (as many races in Long Pond usually do) to become the first owner/driver to win since Ricky Rudd won in September of 1998 at Martinsville Speedway. Geoff Bodine was the last <b>owner</b> <b>driver</b> to win at Pocono Raceway. Kevin Harvick made his 300th start in this race, finishing in 24th position.|$|E

[...] The goal for the new model was to increase power & performance. [...] This was achieved by increasing the bore size from 3 to 3.25 inches. The stroke was unchanged at 4.5 inches. This resulted in a 17% increase in capacity from 3128 to 3675cc - bring the RAC rating up to 25.4 hp.|$|E

The race was won at Pocono Raceway in the Spring of 2009 and was won on fuel strategy. During the 2011 season, Grubb led Stewart from a mediocre pre-chase effort to five chase victories and Stewart's third NASCAR Championship by way of a 5-1 victory tiebreaker over Carl Edwards that NASCAR uses in the event of a tie in the points standings at the end of the season. If the champion cannot be determined using the victory tiebreaker, then owners points are used for this purpose. This was Grubb's first championship.

50|$|A {{native of}} Asheville, North Carolina, Silver's career {{started in the}} Whelen All-American Series, in which he {{finished}} fourth in the 1982 Mid-Atlantic Region season. Eventually, Silver joined the Busch Series in its inaugural season as an <b>owner</b> <b>driver,</b> and finished 7th in the Southeastern 150 at Bristol Motor Speedway. Silver ended the season 15th in points with 1,514, along with 7 top tens and 2 top fives. In 1984, Silver was the car owner for Jack Ingram, who won the Busch 200 at Langley Speedway. In 1985, Silver claimed his first career NASCAR victory in the Bobby Isaac Memorial 200 at Hickory Motor Speedway; Silver won again at Hickory in 1986, {{this time in the}} Mountain Dew 400 after taking the lead from Jack Ingram with 11 laps left. In 1985 and 1986, Silver finished 8th (3268 points) and 7th (3927 points), respectively. In 1989, Silver's slow time trial for the All Pro 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway relegated him to the 40-lap consolation race as a last chance to qualify for the event. However, Silver did not make the field. In 1992, Silver's team served Shawna Robinson at Daytona International Speedway, North Carolina Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway, crashing at Daytona and Atlanta. The following season, Silver failed to qualify for The Pantry 300.|$|E

5000|$|Marcis {{experienced}} moderate {{success as}} an <b>owner</b> <b>driver</b> during the 1980s. In 1981, he went upside down during a race at Atlanta after hitting two tractor tires {{at the entrance}} of pit road while trying to avoid a spinning Tim Richmond. The highlight of Marcis' career as an owner-driver was winning at the old Richmond Fairgrounds in 1982 driving a very un-raceable looking 81 Chevy Malibu. Marcis was a lap down, but made up the lap when the race leader Joe Ruttman spun out and Marcis passed him. All three drivers that were ahead of Marcis pitted and he assumed the lead as it began to rain. The race was called complete as darkness set in, and Marcis was declared the winner. Marcis described the win, [...] "I wasn't praying for rain, but I told the guys when I {{got out of the car}} (during the break before the race was canceled) that if the good Lord wanted to help an independent, this was his chance." [...] "It was one of my greatest moments in racing," [...] Marcis said. [...] "I had even built my own engine for that race." [...] From that point Marcis' team gradually became less competitive as more well-funded teams found their way into the series. Marcis was occasionally known to moonlight for other car owners such as Larry Hedrick (later of Hedrick Motorsports). Often Marcis would still field his own car, usually with Jim Sauter behind the wheel.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to assess what competitive advantage a Removals company could expect to gain by outsourcing its driver function to owner drivers. An extensive literature review identified key outsourcing issues. The literature was related to a case study of Stuttaford Van Lines (SVL), a company that is experiencing problems with its current independent contractor driver arrangements and that needs to review its outsourcing decision. In order to learn from best practice in the field of outsourcing to owner drivers, a benchmarking exercise was undertaken at South African Breweries (SAB). The benchmarking exercise identified six key issues that contributed {{to the success of the}} SAB <b>owner</b> <b>driver</b> scheme. These points, together with others identified from the literature, were integrated into a recommended outsourcing implementation process for SVL. The research found that it is possible for SVL to outsource the driver function to owner drivers and that such a scheme can be expected to improve customer service levels. The success of the scheme will depend on the selection of the drivers and how effectively it is managed. It was found that it would not be profitable for SVL to outsource to owner drivers using the compensation model proposed. Cost reduction is however only one of the factors to consider in an outsourcing decision...|$|E
