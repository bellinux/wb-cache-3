2500|$|Backmasking {{has also}} been used to record {{statements}} perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track [...] "Hot Poop", from We're Only in It for the Money (1968). The released version contains {{at the end of}} its side [...] "A" [...] the backmasked message [...] "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b> / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" [...] This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song [...] "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as [...] "Hot Poop" [...] (though even in the backward message the word [...] "fucking" [...] is censored). On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in [...] "Harry, You're a Beast" [...] with Madge saying, [...] "Don't come in me, in me" [...] repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.|$|E
2500|$|Miranda's creator, Colleen Ballinger, based the {{character}} partly on young women {{that she knew}} in the performance department of her college, Azusa Pacific University. She told The Times of London, [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they ... were so rude and snotty, it drove me nuts. Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube ... clueless {{to the fact that they}} were terrible." [...] Ballinger said: [...] "I thought it was so stupid, because I didn't think anybody got famous off of YouTube." [...] Also, when bored in choir class, Ballinger practiced singing slightly sharp or flat to amuse her friends. At first, the [...] "Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke" [...] among Ballinger's friends. Ballinger's YouTube channel received little traffic for more than a year, but in March 2009, she uploaded a video called [...] "Free Voice Lesson" [...] that quickly became a sensation. The video consists of advice to use, and demonstrations of, techniques that real voice teachers would warn students to avoid, delivered in Miranda's arrogant, off-key way. Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, as many viewers mistakenly believed {{the character}} was a real person, a [...] "neo-Florence Foster Jenkins". As her videos became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments to make it more extreme, baiting the commenters by adopting the catchphrases [...] "Haters Back Off" [...] and [...] "Haters Make Me Famous". [...] "People would make fun <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> and I made it worse. ... I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video." ...|$|E
