40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} devoted to {{foundations}} of probability theory. We discuss interpretations of probability, corresponding mathematical formalisms, and applications to quantum physics. One of the aims {{of this paper is}} to show that the probability model based on Kolmogorov’s axiomatics cannot describe all stochastic phenomena, i. e., that quantum physics induces natural restrictions of the use of Kolmogorov’s theory and that we need to develop non-Kolmogorov models for describing some quantum phenomena. The physical motivations are presented in a clear and brief manner. Thus the reader does not need to have preliminary knowledge of quantum physics. Our main idea is that we cannot develop non-Kolmogorov models by the formal change of Kolmogorov’s axiomatics. We begin with interpretations (classical, frequency, and proportional). Then we present a class of non-Kolmogorov models described by so-called p-adic <b>numbers.</b> <b>Here,</b> <b>in</b> particular, we obtain a quite natural realization of negative probabilities. These negative probability distributions might provide a solution of some quantum paradoxes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} and make {{computations}} of two equivariant Nielsen type numbers NG(f(H),k(H)) and NG(f(H),k(H)). The second one is new, {{while the first}} one extends and clarifies one given earlier by the author and Jianhan Guo. Both <b>numbers</b> were defined <b>here</b> <b>in</b> terms of Nielsen theory of M-ads introduced in the prequel to this work. The theory of M-ads {{is also used to}} give both upper and lower bounds on <b>our</b> <b>numbers,</b> and to make specific computations. <b>Our</b> <b>numbers</b> moreover, fit together {{in the same way that}} the two Nielsen type periodic point numbers NPn(f) and NΦn(f) fit together. In particular, we show that NG(f(H),k(H)) is greater than or equal to a sum of numbers of the form NG(f(K),k(K)), and give conditions for equality and Möbius inversion. The periodic point theory results are then seen to follow from what are actually generalizations of them. We work with both fixed point, and coincidence point classes, in the context of a category with essentiality which we introduced in the prequel on M-ads. It is intended that this paper be read in tandem with said prequel...|$|R

5000|$|Verdi scored Falstaff {{for three}} flutes (third {{doubling}} piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum), harp, and strings. In addition, a guitar, natural horn, and bell are heard from offstage. Unlike most of Verdi's earlier operatic scores, Falstaff is through-composed. No list of numbers is {{printed in the}} published full score. The score differs from much of Verdi's earlier work by having no overture: there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice (Dr Caius) enters. The critic Rodney Milnes comments that [...] "enjoyment... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse, its effortless melody, its rhythmic vitality, and sureness of dramatic pace and construction."

40|$|Case II {{diffusion}} {{is often}} seen in glassy polymers, where the mass uptake in sorption is proportional to time t instead of √(t). A memory dependent diffusion is needed to explain such effects, where the relaxation function {{used to describe the}} memory effect has a characteristic time. The ratio of this time to the overall diffusion times is the diffusional Deborah number. Simple models show that case II results when the Deborah number is around one, that is, when the two time scales are comparable. Under investigation are the possible effects {{of the fact that the}} glassy polymers are heterogeneous over molecular scales. The averaging form given by DiMarzio and Sanchez has been used to obtain the averaged response. The calculated dynamics of sorption show that whereas case II is still observed, the long term tails change dramatically from the oscillatory to torpid, to chaotic, which are all observed in the experiments. The Deborah <b>number</b> defined <b>here</b> <b>in</b> a self-consistent manner collapses in those cases, but causes no other ill-effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flow around ship rudders in uniform inflow {{is computed by}} solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The standard k-#epsilon# turbulence model with wall function is applied. The conservation equations are discretized by a (nearly) second-order finite volume method in a block-structured body-fitted grid and solved by the SIMPLE method. A simple procedure is applied to determine the cell-face velocity independent of the under-relaxation factor used in solving the momentum equations. The two-dimensional flow around various profiles is computed {{for a range of}} attack angles. Up to the stall angle the computed lift agrees well with measurements, whereas drag, stall angle and lift beyond the stall angle are a little over-predicted. The rudder profile HSVA MP 73 -xx proved to be superior to the most-used NACA 00 xx profile. The three-dimensional flow around rudders of different aspect ratio, taper ratio, profile shape and thickness was computed at different Reynolds <b>numbers.</b> Also <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> general the results agreed very well with measurements below the stall angle whereas greater differences were observed beyond stall.
