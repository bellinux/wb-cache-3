5|$|Welles {{later said}} that casting {{character}} actor Gino Corrado {{in the small}} part of the waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado had appeared in many Hollywood films, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less <b>often)</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{had little}} formal {{scientific}} training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular {{trips to the}} American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition {{now known as the}} Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career {{toward the end of his}} life before dying on April 12, 1897.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, 57 {{percent of}} Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish {{as their primary}} {{language}} while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under {{one percent of the}} population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} Germany Must Perish! which called for the sterilization of the German people {{and the distribution of}} the German lands.

5|$|Keen Johnson {{was born}} in a two-room cabin at Brandon's Chapel in Lyon County, Kentucky, on January 12, 1896. He was the only son of Reverend Robert and Mattie (Holloway) Johnson. His parents named him in honor of John S. Keen, a family friend from Adair County. The Johnsons also had two daughtersâ€”Catherine (Keturah) and Christine. Robert Johnson was a Methodist minister, and the family moved <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his occupation.|$|E

Even after leaving Hinton to pursue her education and career, Burwell has maintained strong ties with her hometown.|$|E
5|$|Related {{work on a}} {{supersonic}} aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, was cancelled in 1965. As a result, the P.1127 (RAF), {{a variant}} more closely based on the Kestrel, was ordered into production that year, and named Harrier - the name originally intended for the P.1154 - in 1967. The Harrier served with the UK and several nations, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> carrier-based aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Though {{described}} <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> world, {{this was}} only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{has been}} {{represented}} in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> peripheral {{character in the}} central storyline. One such modern representation is in the novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves, and the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker. George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes, it mixes with the soil to create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{was used}} {{scarcely}} and <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> substitute, scoring only 4 goals in 18 appearances {{during the regular}} Serie A season. He made five appearances in the Coppa Italia, with his only goal coming against local rivals Milan in the second leg of the quarter-finals, as he helped Inter reach the final, only to be defeated by Lazio. Despite his limited playing time, Baggio still managed several important goals to help Inter to a fourth-place finish, alongside Parma, such as his match winning goal against Hellas Verona, which he scored after coming off the bench, after being excluded from the team since 18 December 1999. Baggio had also previously helped to set up Inter's equaliser during the match. This {{was the first time}} Baggio had scored for Inter since his goal on 27 May of the previous season, and in the post-match the interview, he denied accusations made by Lippi in regard to his personal form.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{was born}} to Vince and Lynn Carrick in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, and first became {{involved}} in football at age five. A boyhood fan of Newcastle United, he played five-a-side football with Wallsend Boys Club on Saturday nights, courtesy of his father's volunteer work at the club. Football became more serious {{for him at the}} age of 12 when he was selected for Burnside High School and later on North Tyneside Schools. While playing for Wallsend Boys' Club under-16s, he was capped for the England Boys' club side. At age 13, Carrick was profiled by the BBC children's programme Live & Kicking episode 49, which aired on 4 February 1995. During his school years, and the years up until his move to West Ham United, Carrick actually played as a centre-forward; it was only at West Ham that he started to play more <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> midfielder. He studied at Wallsend's Western Middle School and Burnside Community High School, completing his GCSE exams in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Downman {{spent most}} of the American War of Independence as a midshipman, with a spell in French captivity after his ship was wrecked off the coast of Ushant while chasing an enemy frigate. He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and served with distinction during operations in the Mediterranean. Downman served under several Admirals, and fought with Jervis at Battle of Cape St Vincent. Shortly after the battle he was rewarded with his own command, going on to capture several privateers and fighting off an attack by a larger vessel. Promoted to post-captain and given a frigate to command, he operated in the Mediterranean and performed services for the nobles and monarchs of the Italian states. Downman went on to command several ships of the line, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flag-captain, and took part in the capture of the Cape Colony and operations on the RÃ­o de la Plata.|$|E
5|$|Other nude Hindu goddesses {{who might}} have {{inspired}} Chhinnamasta are the malevolent war goddess Kotavi and the South-Indian hunting goddess Korravai. Kotavi, sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother goddess"), is nude, dishevelled, wild, and awful in appearance. She is mentioned in the scriptures Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foe of the god Vishnu. The ferocious, wild Korravai is the goddess of war and victory. Both goddesses are linked to battlefields; Chhinnamasta is not. Kinsley points out that while there are several bloodthirsty, nude, and wild goddesses and demonesses in Hindu mythology, Chhinnamasta is the only goddess who displays the shocking self-decapitation motif.|$|E
50|$|In many places, {{especially}} in colder {{countries such as}} Russia or Korea, men and women continued to wear wool leggings into modern times, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> additional outer layer for warmth.|$|R
