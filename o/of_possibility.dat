His philosophical novel, Hayy ibn Yaqdha, translated into Latin as Philosophus Autodidactus in 1671, developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture, condition <b>of</b> <b>possibility,</b> materialism, and Molyneux's problem.

25|$|From about 1450, {{with the}} arrival in Italy of the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden and {{possibly}} earlier, artists {{were introduced to the}} medium of oil paint. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically.

25|$|However, the {{autonomy}} of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted. An important part of Bourdieu's theory is that the historical development of a scientific field, sufficiently autonomous to be described as such and to produce objective work, is an achievement that requires continual reproduction. Having been achieved, it cannot be assumed to be secure. Bourdieu does not discount the possibility that the scientific field may lose its autonomy and therefore deteriorate, losing its defining characteristic as a producer of objective work. In this way, the conditions <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.|$|E

25|$|The words {{represent}} the sociolinguistic dimension and are {{understood as a}} function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of facial expression, body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood {{as a function of}} behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.|$|E
25|$|In {{modal logic}} (which studies {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> and necessity), he has argued {{in favour of}} the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, “just as being physically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it gives us the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.” In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths {{can be compared to}} their alternatives.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{developed}} a grounded {{theory that describes}} and explains the processes by which a sample of highly educated young adults organizes and gives meaning to work careers in the contemporary milieu. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 24 graduates from Harvard University 2 ̆ 7 s Class of 1996, I identified a sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> as the core conceptual category for understanding how informants construct careers. Through a combination of cultural, relational and individual influences, informants {{developed a}} sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> that was either uncomplicated or complicated. An uncomplicated sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> included awareness <b>of</b> a limited range <b>of</b> <b>possibilities,</b> clarity about the <b>possibilities,</b> a sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> as relatively permanent career solutions and a conception <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> as fixed. Conversely, a complicated sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> involved awareness <b>of</b> an extensive range <b>of</b> <b>possibilities,</b> ambiguity about the <b>possibilities,</b> a sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> as short-term career solutions, and a conception <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> as pliable. The more complicated their sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities,</b> the more actively individuals engaged in constructing a career. Three subprocesses relate to this core category: becoming aware <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> explains {{the conditions under which}} a sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> develops, confronting the possibilities explains the strategies of action individuals employ to contend with their sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities,</b> and living with possibilities and choices explains how people 2 ̆ 7 s careers and lives are shaped by the consequences of their actions and choices in the process of constructing their careers. The theory developed in this study suggests that, in constructing their careers, informants use whatever structural resources are available and impose their own structure where it is otherwise lacking and action is required. The convergence of available structural resources, a person 2 ̆ 7 s sense <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities,</b> and the action strategies employed to confront those possibilities leads people to construct either institutional or individual careers. These distinct career orientations have different consequences for the shape of the resulting work career, for the relationships between work careers and other interdependent careers, as well as for people 2 ̆ 7 s overall well-being. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Services have {{tangible}} and intangible aspects. Services {{are organized}} {{as a system}} of conceptual ideas (space <b>of</b> <b>possibilities)</b> and are enacted through social and physical arrangements (<b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> space). Games are employed in service design to expand the space <b>of</b> <b>possibilities</b> with new insights; however, the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> space are sometimes not recognized, experienced, or realized through these games. Method: Game sessions were organized to support the co-design of three services: medical imaging diagnosis, hospital care, and environmental education/leisure. A case study for each project is provided, with {{the focus on the}} spaces produced by the participants’ interactions. Results: Even as participants were designing services for the future, they realized the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> space in their current services and made use of these soon after the game sessions. Transformative actions initiated in the co-design sessions went beyond play, reaching the work activities that sustain the services. Conclusions: Games in service design can be insightful as much as transformative. Game spatiality, in particular, can lead participants to make use <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> space not conceptualized before, which are outside of the space <b>of</b> <b>possibilities...</b>|$|R
