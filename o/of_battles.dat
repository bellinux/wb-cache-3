5|$|The {{imperial}} army {{invaded the}} Papal States {{under the command}} of Rainald of Urslingen in October 1228.

He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for the}} losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series <b>of</b> <b>battles,</b> the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
25|$|The first {{detachment}} of the regiment {{left for the}} field army in late January 1814, but by mid March the entire regiment was reduced to 200 sabres. The regiment was eventually renamed as the 2nd Regiment of Chasseurs a Cheval of the Guard in 1815. The 1st Éclaireurs fought on many engagements during the 1814 campaign in France : Six Days Campaign, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Brienne, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Champaubert, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Montmirail, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Château-Thierry, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Vauchamps, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Montereau, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Craonne, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Arcis-sur-Aube, <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Dizier and <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Paris.|$|R

In between engagements, the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E

5|$|Anti-vivisectionists {{commissioned}} a bronze {{statue of the}} dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque—"Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?"—leading to frequent vandalism of the memorial {{and the need for}} a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, one of a series <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E
5|$|Assaf Tarabay was not {{reinstated}} as governor, but Lajjun {{remained in}} Tarabay hands, {{under the rule}} of Governor Tarabay ibn Ali who was succeeded upon his death by his son Ahmad in 1601, who also ruled until his death in 1657. Ahmad, known for his courage and hospitality, helped the Ottomans defeat the rebel Janbulad and gave shelter to Yusuf Sayfa — Janbulad's principal rival. Ahmad, in coordination with the governors of Gaza (the Ridwan family) and Jerusalem (the Farrukh family), also fought against Fakhr ad-Din II in a prolonged series <b>of</b> <b>battles,</b> which ended with the victory of the Tarabay-Ridwan-Farrukh alliance after their forces routed Fakhr ad-Din's army at the al-Auja river in central Palestine in 1623.|$|E
5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against opposing forces. However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' that shows the motions and voices of the officers. A gallery of character artworks and game movies is also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E

5|$|Following the Roman Empire's {{invasion}} of southern Britain, the mining of lead and {{silver in the}} Mendip Hills provided a basis for local industry and commerce. Bath became {{the site of a}} major Roman fort and city, the remains of which can still be seen. During the Early Medieval period Somerset was the scene <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> between the Anglo-Saxons and first the Britons and later the Danes.

Set in a high fantasy universe, Heroes of Mana follows a young soldier, Roget, as he journeys to defend several nations from the ruthless aggression of his own country in a series <b>of</b> <b>battles.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{military}} movements by imperial forces, partisan {{violence in}} Edo, and an imperial decree promoted by Satsuma and Chōshū abolishing {{the house of}} Tokugawa led Yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize the emperor's court in Kyoto. The military tide rapidly turned {{in favor of the}} smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction, and after a series <b>of</b> <b>battles</b> culminating in the surrender of Edo, Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Those loyal to the Tokugawa retreated to northern Honshū and later to Hokkaidō, where they founded the Ezo republic. Defeat at the Battle of Hakodate broke this last holdout and left the imperial rule supreme throughout the whole of Japan, completing the military phase of the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
50|$|The 4th Division was {{originally}} formed in 1809 by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, {{as part of}} the Anglo-Portuguese Army, for service in the Peninsular War.
