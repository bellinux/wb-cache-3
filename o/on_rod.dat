By the 15th century, rods of approximately fourteen feet length with a twisted line attached at its tips were probably used in England.|$|E

25|$|The {{other four}} fourth round matches all took the court {{on the eighth}} day, with three of the top eight seeds in play advancing. Top seed Maria Sharapova was pushed to two close sets by fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva but {{eventually}} prevailed 7–5, 6–4. Fourth-seeded Belgian Kim Clijsters beat Daniela Hantuchová, who was playing for the second {{day in a row}} 6–1 7–5 to advance to the quarterfinals, where she was drawn to face Martina Hingis, who needed three sets to battle past the number one ranked Chinese player Li Na after being a set down. She won 4–6, 6–3, 6–0. The final match of the day was the only women's match to be played on Vodafone Arena, with the others all being <b>on</b> <b>Rod</b> Laver Arena. There the twelfth-seeded Russian Anna Chakvetadze pulled off a surprisingly easy 6–4, 6–1 victory over former semi-finalist Patty Schnyder of Switzerland to advance to her first ever Grand Slam quarterfinal, and would next meet Sharapova.|$|E

25|$|Five years later, veteran host Tom Kennedy {{starred in}} a new daily {{syndicated}} version, which also used the traditional half-hour format and was syndicated by The Television Program Source. Like the previous syndicated series, this version had a slightly larger budget than its daytime counterpart. A perfect bid during the One-Bids won that contestant a $500 bonus (compared to $100 awarded on the daytime show during the same period); this bonus would permanently carry over to the daytime show in 1998. This version used the same models as the daytime show as well as announcer Johnny Olson, who as noted above died during the season. Unlike the daytime series, which employed a series of guest announcers until a permanent replacement was decided upon, the syndicated series brought Gene Wood in to fill in for Olson. When the daytime series decided <b>on</b> <b>Rod</b> Roddy as the permanent replacement for Olson, {{he took over the}} syndicated series from Wood as well.|$|E
25|$|Li Na {{followed}} her strong showing at the Medibank tournament with an equally strong showing at the 2007 Australian Open, where she {{advanced to the}} fourth round. Seeded 19th, Li dispatched Elena Bovina and Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets through the first two rounds, leading to a matchup with no. 9 Dinara Safina. The match was postponed due to rain, but Li handily beat Safina {{to advance to the}} fourth round to play Swiss star, no. 6 Martina Hingis. Due to a rain delay and the fact that Hingis played <b>on</b> <b>Rod</b> Laver Arena, a roofed court, on the originally scheduled day, Hingis had an extra day of rest. The match the previous day seemed to have no effect, as Li took the first set from Hingis. However, Na faded as the match went on and lost while committing 69 unforced errors. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for Na, as it marked the third straight time in a Grand Slam that she advanced at least to the fourth round.|$|E

However, after a {{promising}} start to the match by taking the opening set, she lost the next two sets with the win of just one game. In the doubles event, Barty partnered countrywoman Casey Dellacqua. They opened the tournament by cruising past Francesca Schiavone and Polona Hercog in straight sets. This win was Barty's first ever Grand Slam victory. They then stunned the third seeded team of Maria Kirilenko and Lisa Raymond and 14th seeded team of Natalie Grandin and Vladimíra Uhlířová en route to the Quarterfinals. The duo then reached the semi-final by defeating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Lucie Šafářová. Their semi-final was played <b>on</b> <b>Rod</b> Laver Arena, which was Barty's first match on the court. Barty and Dellacqua made the final by defeating Zheng Saisai and Varvara Lepchenko in two sets and became the first Australian duo to reach the women's doubles final of the Australian open since 1977. They played top seeds Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci in the final. They dropped the opening set 6–2 in just 29 minutes. But gained composure in the second to take it 6–3. The Italians won the third set and the match. Errani and Vinci took home the title after being defeated the previous year.|$|E
