25|$|Throughout {{the first}} year of life, infants are unable to {{communicate}} with language. Instead, infants communicate with gestures. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding, 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.|$|E

The aims of this study are: (1) to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>parenting</b> intervention in improving behavior and self-regulation in Mexican children with ABI compared to telephone support; (2) to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>parenting</b> intervention in improving parenting skills, parent self-efficacy and decreasing parental stress in parents of children with ABI compared to telephone support. Our secondary aims are (1) to explore the impact that parent characteristics have on the intervention outcomes; (2) to investigate if changes are maintained 3 months after the intervention. Methods: The research design is a blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Eligible participants include children with <b>a</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> ABI, between 6 and 12 years of age, and their parents. Sixty-six children and their parents will be randomly allocated to either <b>a</b> <b>parenting</b> program group or telephone support group.
