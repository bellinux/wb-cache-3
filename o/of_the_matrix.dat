5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matrix,</b> which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matrix</b> through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matrix</b> exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E

However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E
