25|$|Potter {{sequence}} is the atypical physical {{appearance of a}} baby due to <b>oligohydramnios</b> experienced when in the uterus. <b>Oligohydramnios</b> is the decrease in amniotic fluid volume sufficient to cause deformations in morphogenesis of the fetus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oligohydramnios</b> is {{the cause}} of Potter {{sequence}} but {{there are many things that}} can lead to <b>oligohydramnios.</b> It can be caused by renal diseases such as bilateral renal agenesis (BRA), atresia of the ureter or urethra causing obstruction of the urinary tract, polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases, renal hypoplasia, amniotic rupture, toxemia, or uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Potter's {{sequence}} {{is known in}} the medical field as clubbed feet, pulmonary hypoplasia and cranial anomalies related to the <b>oligohydramnios.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{deformation}} is {{a condition}} arising from mechanical stress to normal tissue. Deformations often occur in {{the second or third}} trimester, and can be due to <b>oligohydramnios.</b>|$|E
25|$|The term Potter {{sequence}} {{was initially}} intended to only refer to cases caused by BRA; however, {{it is now}} commonly used by many clinicians and researchers to refer to any case that presents with <b>oligohydramnios</b> or anhydramnios regardless {{of the source of}} the loss of amniotic fluid.|$|E
25|$|In {{pregnant}} women, ACE inhibitors {{taken during}} all the trimesters {{have been reported}} to cause congenital malformations, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include hypotension, renal dysplasia, anuria/oliguria, <b>oligohydramnios,</b> intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and incomplete ossification of the skull. Overall, about half of newborns exposed to ACE inhibitors are adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|External {{physical}} shocks or constrainment due {{to growth}} in a restricted space, {{may result in}} unintended deformation or separation of cellular structures resulting in an abnormal final shape or damaged structures unable to function as expected. An example is Potter syndrome due to <b>oligohydramnios.</b> This finding is important for future understandings of how genetics may predispose individuals for diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cancer.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is by {{endoscopic}} valve ablation. Fetal {{surgery is}} a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe <b>oligohydramnios,</b> to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death. Specific procedures for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating {{a connection between the}} amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its initial}} characterization, Potter {{sequence}} {{has been defined}} into five distinct subclassifications. There are those in the medical and research fields that use the term Potter sequence to specifically refer to only cases of BRA, while other groups use the term to loosely refer to all instances of <b>oligohydramnios</b> and anhydramnios regardless of the specific cause. The assignment of nomenclature to the various causes (types) was employed {{in order to help}} clarify these discrepancies, but these subclassifications and nomenclature system have not caught on in the medical and research communities.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the mature}} kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine {{production}} begins in early gestation and comprises {{the majority of}} the amniotic fluid {{in the second and third}} trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the amniotic cavity by the kidneys via urination. <b>Oligohydramnios</b> occurs if the volume of amniotic fluid is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation. The fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways - alveoli, by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development. Alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood. If the alveoli, and thereby the lungs, are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be able to breathe air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). This is the primary cause of death to Potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure. The fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mother's uterus as it grows.|$|E

2500|$|Potter {{syndrome}} is not technically a syndrome {{as it does}} not collectively present with the same telltale characteristics and symptoms in each and every case. It is more accurately described as a [...] "sequence" [...] or chain of events [...] that may have different beginnings (absent kidneys, cystic kidneys, obstructed ureters or other causes), but which all end with the same conclusion (absent or reduced volume of amniotic fluid). This is why Potter {{syndrome is}} often called Potter sequence or <b>oligohydramnios</b> sequence by some clinicians and researchers. The term Potter syndrome is most frequently associated with the condition of <b>oligohydramnios</b> sequence regardless of {{the root cause of}} the absence or reduced volume of amniotic fluid. However, as noted in this article, the term Potter syndrome was initially coined in order to refer to fetuses and infants with BRA. It was not until later that the term became more encompassing as it was noted that other causes of failed fetal urine production also resulted in similar physical characteristics and prognoses of the fetuses and infants with BRA (that which Potter originally described in 1946). Since then, the term Potter syndrome has become a misnomer and experts have attempted not to eliminate the terminology, but to modify it in a way so as to be able to determine the different root causes by creating a nomenclature system. However, this classification system has not caught on in the clinical and research fields.|$|E

50|$|The risk of {{miscarriage}} in CVS {{is estimated}} to be about 1-2%. Apart from a risk of miscarriage, there is a risk of infection and amniotic fluid leakage. The resulting amniotic fluid leak can develop into a condition known as <b>oligohydramnios,</b> which is low amniotic fluid level. If the resulting <b>oligohydramnios</b> is not treated and the amniotic fluid continues to leak it can result in the baby developing hypoplastic lungs (underdeveloped lungs).|$|E
50|$|Placental {{insufficiency}} {{can affect}} the fetus, causing Fetal distress. Placental insufficiency may cause <b>oligohydramnios,</b> preeclampsia, miscarriage or stillbirth. Placental insufficiency is most frequent cause of asymmetric IUGR.|$|E

5000|$|An AFI < 5-6 is {{considered}} as <b>oligohydramnios.</b> The exact number can vary by gestational age. The fifth percentile for gestational age is sometimes {{used as a}} cutoff value.|$|E
50|$|Stage I: A {{small amount}} of amniotic fluid (<b>oligohydramnios)</b> is found around the donor twin and {{a large amount of}} amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) is found around the {{recipient}} twin.|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary {{hypoplasia}} {{is associated}} with <b>oligohydramnios</b> through multiple mechanisms. Both conditions can result from blockage of the urinary bladder. Blockage prevents the bladder from emptying, and the bladder becomes very large and full. The large volume of the full bladder interferes with normal development of other organs, including the lungs. Pressure within the bladder becomes abnormally high, causing abnormal function in the kidneys hence abnormally high pressure in the vascular system entering the kidneys. This high pressure also interferes with normal development of other organs. An experiment in rabbits showed that PH also can be caused directly by <b>oligohydramnios.</b>|$|E
50|$|Potter {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} caused by <b>oligohydramnios.</b> Affected fetuses develop pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and characteristic facies. Bilateral agenesis of the fetal kidneys {{is the most common}} cause {{due to the lack of}} fetal urine.|$|E
50|$|Meckel {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, Gruber Syndrome, Dysencephalia Splanchnocystica) is a rare, lethal, ciliopathic, genetic disorder, characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, {{central nervous system}} malformations (occipital encephalocele), polydactyly (post axial), hepatic developmental defects, and pulmonary hypoplasia due to <b>oligohydramnios.</b>|$|E
50|$|On every {{prenatal}} visit, the obstetrician/gynaecologist or midwife should {{measure the}} patient's fundal height with a tape measure. It {{is important that}} the fundal height be measured and properly recorded to track proper fetal growth and the increasing development of amniotic fluid. The obstetrician/gynaecologist or midwife should also routinely ultrasound the patient—this procedure will also give an indication of proper fetal growth and amniotic fluid development. <b>Oligohydramnios</b> can be caused by infection, kidney dysfunction or malformation (since much of the late amniotic fluid volume is urine), procedures such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). <b>Oligohydramnios</b> can sometimes be treated with bed rest, oral and intravenous hydration, antibiotics, steroids, and amnioinfusion. It is also important to keep the baby warm and moist.|$|E
