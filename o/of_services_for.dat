5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>for</b> people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> <b>For</b> some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E

25|$|A {{transport}} plan {{released by}} the New South Wales Government in 1998 reported that the line carried an average of 5000 passengers on weekdays. 2.8 million journeys were made in 2009-10, increasing to 4.2 million in 2012-13. The partial integration of the line into the broader Sydney ticketing system was a major driver of the increase. In the 12 months to June 2015, the line carried 6.1 million passengers, compared to 3.9 million passengers in the prior year. The increase in the 2014-15 figure {{was influenced by the}} opening of the extension to Dulwich Hill in March 2014, while the 2013-14 figure was affected by the suspension <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>for</b> much of October 2013 and closures for maintenance works. In the period from 2015-2016, 9.7 million journeys were made, followed by 9.1 million in 2016-2017. The 2016-2017 statistic was affected by a partial closure of the line in December 2016/January 2017 for construction works on the CBD and South East Light Rail.|$|E
