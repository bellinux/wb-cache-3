5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 {{when a group}} of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|End of Watch {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in South Central Los Angeles, primarily {{in the area of}} the LAPD's Newton Division, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> and gang-affiliated areas of the city. Filming took place over 22 days in August 2011, with a budget of $7.5 million. The film was shot in a combination of found footage style and traditional photography. Most scenes were captured by four cameras simultaneously: these included a handheld camera operated by Gyllenhaal, cameras clipped to Gyllenhaal and Peña's vests, and dashboard footage from their patrol car. Some scenes were shot entirely by Gyllenhaal. An alternate ending of the film was shot where both of the main characters died, but Ayer ultimately chose to retain the original ending.|$|E
5|$|Tijori {{produced}} and played his only {{lead role in}} Gowariker-directed murder mystery Pehla Nasha (1993), alongside Pooja Bhatt and Raveena Tandon. Upon release, the film received poor reviews and failed at the box office. In the same year, he appeared as the antagonist in D Rama Naidu-directed Santaan. Tijori starred alongside Shah Rukh Khan in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa and Anjaam (both 1994). The latter one is considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> films in Bollywood. In 1995, he starred in another Mahesh Bhatt-directed film Naajayaz. Tijori played a supporting role in action drama Mrityudata (1997) which did not receive favourable reviews from critics. He portrayed supporting characters in Aamir Khan-starrer Ghulam (1998) and the Abbas-Mustan-directed comedy thriller Baadshah. In the latter, he featured as the titular undercover CBI agent.|$|E

5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down {{the plane of the}} former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. He was widely regarded as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of}} the safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E

25|$|Various {{confrontations}} {{took place}} in the 1930s in which Nationalist Party partisans were involved and that led to a call for an uprising against the United States and the eventual attack of the United States House of Representatives in 1954. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> incidents was the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which police officers fired upon Nationalists who were participating in a peaceful demonstration against American abuse of authority. About 100 civilians were wounded and 19 were killed, among them, a woman, Maria Hernández del Rosario, and a seven-year-old child, Georgina Maldonado.|$|E

25|$|The Armed Islamic Group, {{active in}} Algeria between 1992 and 1998, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> Islamic {{terrorist}} groups, and {{is thought to}} have takfired the Muslim population of Algeria. Its campaign to overthrow the Algerian government included civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation.

In recent years it has been eclipsed by a splinter group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), now called Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb.|$|E

40|$|Latin America is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> regions, with 40 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50 <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> cities, {{but with}} only 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s population, and a {{staggering}} 33 % of global homicides. At <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> these {{high levels of}} violence are gangs that are more flexible and persistent than previously thought. This paper provides a discussion on gangs in one Latin American city, Medellin, Colombia, where different non-state groups have contributed to changing patterns <b>of</b> homicide rates. <b>The</b> paper presents preliminary findings to show how, despite the city experiencing a 90 % reduction in homicide rates in less than 25 years, violent non-state groups have become embedded as part and product of their environment, acting as coherent, logical and functional players, linked to the structural inequalities and institutional fragility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger society...|$|R
25|$|Within two weeks, Colebatch had {{yet another}} crisis to deal with: the Fremantle wharf crisis of 1919.

Lumpers objected to goods being unloaded by non-union labour from the ship Dimboola. Colebatch {{was the target of}} a barrage of projectiles when he personally confronted the unionists.

25|$|The killings {{took place}} during one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> phases of Guatemala's Civil War, which pitted various groups of left-wing insurgents against the {{government}} and the armed forces. After assuming power in March 1982, defacto President Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt embarked on a military campaign that largely succeeded in breaking the insurgency, but at a terrible cost in human lives and human rights violations. The massacre in Plan de Sánchez was an element in the government's scorched earth strategy, and the village was targeted because of the authorities' suspicions that the inhabitants were harbouring or otherwise supporting guerrilla groups.|$|E
25|$|BC Penitentiary had {{few major}} violent {{incidents}} {{in its early}} history. It did not experience its first riot until 1934, its 56th year of operation. However, it began to experience exponentially more of these major incidents as the facility aged and became less suitable as a modern prison. Most of BC Penitentiary’s major violent incidents occurred in its final 10 years of operation in the 1970s. During the 1970s, BC Penitentiary was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>violent</b> federal institutions in Canada.
