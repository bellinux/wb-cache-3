Later, more comprehensive histological surveys of plate microstructure attributed the vascularization to the need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth, asserting the plates' physiology, if beneficial, was a side benefit secondary to their primary function, identification and display. The use of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1580s, with the {{development}} of English colonization schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilized considerably over time. [...] Merchant and colonization proponent, George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; [...] "there are at this day great numbers which Hue in such penurie & want, as they could be content to hazard their Hues, and to [...] one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates." [...] With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of [...] indentured service. [...] At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to Divers Voyages, likens English planters to [...] "Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad"; he recommends [...] "deducting" [...] the poor <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm.</b> Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send them off to the New World. By 1619 Virginia's system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavor with the Transportation Act 1717.|$|E

2500|$|The appeal {{trial was}} held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all. It didn't – but it did show how utterly {{confused}} the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said he {{had every right to}} mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port.

2500|$|The {{first major}} {{independent}} British designer {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s, Brookes revolutionized the approach to British garden design. Influenced by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholsen, Brookes brought Abstract and Modernist principles to garden design. He pushed the then-revolutionary concept that a garden’s design should hinge first and foremost {{on the needs of}} its occupants, taking it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of the grand garden traditions which were labor-intensive, expensive, and high maintenance. [...] Early in his career, influenced by modern architecture and art, he developed a methodology called “the Grid.” [...] The Grid methodology projects the vertical lines and dimensions of the architecture of a site onto the horizontal plane of the garden. [...] This methodology, coupled with his conviction that cultural context should dictate the planting, materials, and other aspects of a garden’s structure, comprises an approach to garden design that he has conveyed to hundreds of thousands of readers and taught to thousands of students during his career. [...] He is the author of over two dozen books, including Room Outside and John Brookes, Master Class, that have been translated into several languages and has taught and lectured in venues around the globe, including Iran, Argentina, Japan, Russia, and the US.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, the State Bar of Arizona categorically forbade {{lawyers in}} that state from {{advertising}} their services. [...] The State Bar initiated disciplinary proceedings against Bates and O'Steen, beginning with a hearing at which {{the validity of the}} rule would not be decided, but at which the pair could introduce evidence in support of overturning the rule. [...] The disciplinary committee that conducted the hearing recommended that Bates and O'Steen be suspended for not less than six months. [...] The pair asked the Arizona Supreme Court to review the proceedings, and specifically contended that the absolute ban on lawyer advertising violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and the First Amendment. [...] The court rejected both claims. [...] The Sherman Act did not apply, the court ruled, because regulating the practice of law was an act inherent to the State of Arizona as sovereign. [...] Although the U.S. Supreme Court had recently ruled that, under the First Amendment, pharmacists could not be forbidden from advertising the prices of prescription drugs, the court reasoned that lawyer advertising was entitled to special considerations that took such speech <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of First Amendment protection. [...] Nevertheless, the court reduced the sanction against Bates and O'Steen to censure only because it felt that the advertising was [...] "done in good faith to test the constitutionality" [...] of the ban on lawyer advertising. [...] A dissenting justice on the court believed that the ban on lawyer advertising impinged on the public's right to know about the activities of the legal profession, and concluded that the ban violated the First Amendment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{historical}} significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem would necessarily change based on where in history {{the text itself}} is situated. However, the general consensus is that the poem is from Viking times and {{can be read as}} descriptive of those times: [...] "The political setting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem has already drawn it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> fancy upon historical ground; and in its details, <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customs and manner <b>of</b> life among <b>the</b> different classes, it is most valuable." [...] There is of course a need to remember <b>the</b> literary nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem when reading it as a historical source as certain aspects do not translate literally and must be read allegorically and stereotypically. For example, despite the explicit and detailed physical differences between the classes in the poem, slaves, freeman, and aristocrats did not necessarily look different. Thus although qualitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social classes are difficult to determine from the text, there is broader understanding that can be gained.|$|R
