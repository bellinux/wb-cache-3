5000|$|Despite Winter's fame in {{northern}} Indiana's Wabash River valley, {{where he lived}} for nearly forty years, he was not well known outside of Indiana during his lifetime. By 1900 Winter and his work had fallen into obscurity. Two <b>of</b> <b>Winter's</b> works that achieved modest success during his lifetime were Spotted Faun and his version of The Indian Captive. Winter's best-known work was his painting <b>of</b> Francis Slocum. <b>Winter</b> and the painting received increased attention after John F. Meginness's biography of Francis Slocum was published fifteen years after Winter's death. [...] Winter and his most noteworthy and valuable works remained largely unknown until the 1930s and 1940s, when the largest single collection <b>of</b> <b>Winter's</b> art and documentary materials {{that he had never}} sold were rediscovered by his descendants. In 1986 Evelyn Osterman Ball of Lafayette, the widow <b>of</b> <b>Winter's</b> great-grandson, Cable Gordon Ball, donated the extensive collection to the Tippecanoe County Historical Association in Lafayette. In addition to Winter’s paintings and sketches, the Association's George Winter Collection includes a large manuscript collection <b>of</b> <b>Winter’s</b> notes, papers, correspondence, and other materials related to his life. The collection has important historic value due to its detailed descriptions <b>of</b> <b>Winter’s</b> firsthand accounts <b>of</b> the Potawatomi and Miami tribes {{in northern}} Indiana during the mid-nineteenth century.|$|R

5|$|The jackal moults twice a year, {{in spring}} and in autumn. In Transcaucasia and Tajikistan, the spring moult begins at the end <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b> If the winter has been warm, the spring moult starts {{in the middle of}} February; if the winter has been cold, it begins in the middle of March. The spring moult lasts for 60–65 days; if the animal is sick, it loses only half of its winter fur. The spring moult commences with the head and limbs, extends to the flanks, chest, belly and rump, and ends at the tail. Fur on the underparts is absent. The autumn moult occurs from mid-September with the growth <b>of</b> <b>winter</b> fur; the {{shedding}} of the summer fur occurs at the same time. The development of the autumn coat starts with the rump and tail and spreads to the back, flanks, belly, chest, limbs and head, with full winter fur being attained at the end of November.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} formulation <b>of</b> <b>Winter's</b> law {{stated that}} the vowels regularly lengthened in front of PIE voiced stops in all environments.
