5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
500|$|In Miller's Falls, Massachusetts, an exterminator {{inspects}} {{the basement}} of Dr. Jeff Eckerle, having been hired to eradicate a cockroach infestation. The exterminator sprays a roach, knocks {{it down to the}} ground, and attempts to crush it underfoot. However, upon doing so, he begins to succumb to anaphylaxis, clutching his heart and collapsing against a wall, while the roach crawls <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> boot, unscathed. When Eckerle returns, he finds the exterminator's body covered with roaches. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is coincidentally nearby, investigating reported UFO sightings in Miller's Grove. While on the phone with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Mulder is approached by the local sheriff, Frass, who reveals that a series of [...] "roach attacks" [...] have taken place in the town. Frass allows Mulder onto the scene at Eckerle's residence.|$|E
2500|$|Clint Bobo {{described}} {{the man as}} being between 510 and 6 feet tall (1.78–1.80 m), weighing [...] and having dark hair sticking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> cap that was long enough to cover his neck and touch his collar. Bobo said the man was wearing a hat and camouflage clothing from head to toe, and identified the pattern as either Mossy Oak break up or leafy wear. He {{described the}} male voice he heard as a very deep, low voice.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the major's brick-coloured, weather-beaten face assumed an even darker tint, and his small dark eyes looked <b>out</b> angrily <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> shaggy brows at his {{youthful}} companion. He managed to suppress the threatened explosion, however, and burst into a loud roar of laughter.|$|R
60|$|Those {{nearest the}} piano--and nobody {{more quickly than}} Jane Hubbard--now {{observed}} that the white face of {{the man on the}} stool had grown whiter still. His eyes gazed <b>out</b> glassily <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> damp brow. He looked like a man who was seeing some ghastly sight. The audience sympathised with him. They felt like that, too.|$|R

2500|$|... 2012: Kyle Busch won {{the race}} after passing Tony Stewart at the finish line. It was the closest finish in Bud Shootout history. The race itself, being the first Sprint Cup event under a new rules package {{designed}} {{to break up the}} controversial two-car tandem drafting of the previous year, was marked by three multi-car crashes during the race caused by drivers getting into the left-rear quarter panel of another car. The first crash happened in the first 25 lap segment when Paul Menard got into David Ragan in turn 2, starting an eight car crash. The drivers involved were: Kasey Kahne, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Jeff Burton, David Ragan, Juan Pablo Montoya and Michael Waltrip. The second one happened on lap 55, also in turn 2. This one started when Marcos Ambrose turned Joey Logano loose. Several other drivers were collected trying to avoid Logano, including Kenseth, Martin Truex, Jr., Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Kevin Harvick. Harvick's brakes failed, and he ended up coasting down the apron with flames coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> car, though they extinguished themselves before Harvick reached the garage. A third crash happened with two laps to go within regulation, when Jeff Gordon got into the back of eventual winner Kyle Busch on turn 4. While Kyle retained control of his car, Gordon shot up the banking and collected Jimmie Johnson, Jamie McMurray and Kurt Busch, and turned sideways on the driver's side door. Gordon was pushed down the track on his side for several hundred feet before his car barrel-rolled three times and came to a rest on his roof.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{night of}} the Monday Night Wars {{occurred}} on March 26, 2001: Raw Is War primarily focused on the major storylines heading into WrestleMania X-Seven, while Nitro held their final episode with a [...] "Night of Champions". Mr. McMahon opened up Nitro and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW. Throughout Raw Is War, McMahon publicly named several WCW wrestlers who would not be retained. Though most would wrestle for the WWE in the ensuing years, he did legitimately fire Jeff Jarrett on TV due to animosity between the two dating back in 1999, when Jarrett blackmailed McMahon for payment when Jarrett was booked for a match at No Mercy when his contract expired the day before). After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCW's final match, the simulcast began. McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and {{toyed with the idea}} of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate, much like the WWF. He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction. Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans, and Hulk Hogan, Buff Bagwell, Booker T, Scott Steiner, Sting, and Goldberg received positive reactions. Vince then proceeded to fire them all, however, to the cheers of the Raw Is War crowd and the jeers of the Nitro crowd. McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania. Shane McMahon, however, appeared on Nitro and announced in kayfabe that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> father's nose, planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity. The Invasion did not begin immediately afterwards, as the WWF was preparing for WrestleMania X-Seven, the year's largest show, which was mere days away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out! You'll be killed!" [...] yelled Ralph, as he {{struggled}} to get <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> pony. The wind had been knocked out of him, but otherwise he was uninjured.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{that is a}} good plan,' {{answered}} the hedgehog. And he walked as fast as his little legs would go {{to keep up with the}} jackal. When they reached the shepherd the jackal pulled <b>out</b> <b>his</b> purse <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> foreleg, and made his bargain.|$|R
50|$|The {{monument}} commemorates Arnold's {{contribution to}} the Continental Army's victory over the British in the Battle of Saratoga. Arnold {{was wounded in the}} foot during the Battle of Quebec, and suffered further injury in the Battle of Ridgefield when his horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> him. <b>His</b> last battle injury was at Saratoga, and it occurred near where this monument is located at Tour Stop #7 - Breymann Redoubt. The leg wound effectively ended his career as a fighting soldier.|$|R

He is wearing a baggy dark jacket, dark vest, dark bow tie, and white shirt. He has a dark bandana around his head. He has a broad nose and dark hair that sticks <b>out</b> wildly <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> bandana. Alaniz was also the great grandfather of Anna Begue de Packman...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, what'll Mrs. O. do, when O. {{goes out}} with the regiment?" [...] Crawley said coming into the room, {{performing}} a duet on his head with two huge hair-brushes, and looking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> hair with admiration on his pretty little wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Leo, {{sticking}} {{his head}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> blanket, [...] "lucky we ain't on the bank, eh, Avuncular?" [...] (Leo sometimes addressed {{me in this}} disrespectful way.) [...] "Curse it! a mosquito has bitten me on the nose," [...] and the head vanished again.|$|E
60|$|But intrude not violently upon man, {{leave him}} alone in his somnambulism, and he kicks <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> feet the ladder of life up which he has climbed, {{constitutes}} himself {{the centre of the}} universe, dreams sordidly about his own particular god, and maunders metaphysically about his own blessed immortality.|$|E
6000|$|Presently he saw Norman coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> the archway, <b>his</b> cap drawn {{over his}} face, and step, gesture, and manner betraying that {{something}} was seriously wrong. He came up almost to his father without seeing him, until startled by his exclamation, [...] "Norman--why, Norman, what's the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{showed how}} it could be done, and {{trembling}} from head to feet, the scared teacher got <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> the tree-top. <b>His</b> face and one shoulder were scratched, but otherwise he appeared to be unhurt. But all were forced to acknowledge that he had had a narrow escape.|$|R
60|$|The {{assumption}} of indifference faded from Rideau's face, {{and with a}} swift glance over his shoulder he drew <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> jacket. Dane afterward decided that he saw, what all the rest were too intent to notice, that the torch was burning out; for with an evident effort and a shrug of his shoulders he answered quietly.|$|R
60|$|Presently mine eyes became {{accustomed}} to the gloom, and I might see the things around more clearly. There, {{in the corner of}} the room, lying upon a mat of filthy rags, his body almost a skeleton, his bloodshot eyes glaring <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> matted hair, I beheld the famous pirate, Captain Edward England.|$|E

She {{that we used to}} call the white Mem wanted to return to look at your face, but the witchwoman forbade her, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|If George {{was engaged}} in {{argument}} with any one else, he would sit by, with his head bowed down, looking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> shaggy eyebrows with a shamefaced satisfaction very unusual with him. Expressions of affection from the naturally gentle are not half so touching as those which are forced out from the hard-favored and severe; and George was affected, even to pain, by the evident pride and regard of his father.|$|E
60|$|The long, intense, soul-trying {{scrutiny}} this brutal wretch had subjected me to {{came to a}} very sudden end. Quick as lightning a long, broad knife flashed <b>out</b> <b>from</b> its concealment <b>under</b> <b>his</b> poncho, {{and with}} one cat-like bound he was before me, the point of his horrid weapon touching my poncho just over the pit of my stomach.|$|R
50|$|On {{the boat}} from Galveston, Texas to New Orleans, he met Maj. James Longstreet, who had {{resigned}} his commission in the United States Army {{and was also}} traveling to Virginia to offer his services to the Confederate states. Lt. Goree, who was eventually promoted to captain, served as Longstreet's aide throughout the war and was involved in almost every battle in which Longstreet's corps took part, from Blackburn's Ford to Appomattox. He was never wounded, although he had several horses shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> him and <b>his</b> clothing was riddled with bullet holes.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1864 Anderson was {{appointed}} colonel of the 5th Georgia Militia, and by May {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general and given command of the 3rd Georgia Militia Brigade. His force was sent to augment the Army of Tennessee following the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in late June, and served throughout the remainder of the Atlanta Campaign. On July 22 in the Battle of Atlanta Anderson's command was only lightly engaged. When Atlanta fell the militia forces were detached from the Army of Tennessee and served during Sherman's March to the Sea that winter. He was part of the Confederate attack in the Battle of Griswoldville on November 22, where [...] "Leading his brigade, Anderson had his clothes riddled with bullets and his horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> him; <b>his</b> coolness and precision in that unfortunate battle were marked." [...] Anderson was indeed wounded in this fight.|$|R
6000|$|The old man leaped up, {{scattering}} {{the men on}} the checkerboard, which flew up {{and struck}} Squire Gordon in the face, knocking him off his stool. The old Colonel was ashy pale, and his eyes glared <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> huge brow like sapphires lit by flame. His spare form, clothed in a seedy Prince Albert frock, towered with a singular dignity. His features worked convulsively a moment, then he burst forth like the explosion of a safety valve: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{bottom of}} the valley was soggy with water, which the thick moss held, spongelike, close to the surface. This water {{squirted}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> feet at every step, and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip. He picked his way from muskeg to muskeg, and followed the other man's footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss.|$|E
60|$|The {{noise of}} {{footsteps}} on the creaking stairs, {{a few minutes after}} the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being caught}} {{unprepared}} by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant {{at the end}} of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness and smoking a cigar, Sherman felt, in his words, [...] "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat". In what would become one of the most notable conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: [...] "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" [...] After a puff of his cigar, Grant replied calmly: [...] "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." [...] Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> him. <b>His</b> performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.|$|R
60|$|There {{were times}} when he was dizzy with thought of her and love of her, when he would stop his horse and with closed eyes picture her as {{he had seen her}} that first day, in the stern-sheets of the whale-boat, dashing madly in to shore and marching belligerently along his veranda to remark that it was pretty {{hospitality}} this letting strangers sink or swim in his front yard. And as {{he opened his eyes and}} urged his horse onward, he would ponder for the ten thousandth time how possibly he was ever to hold her when she was so wild and bird-like that she was bound to flutter <b>out</b> and away <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|That Whittier {{was not a}} great poet, as {{the critics}} assure us, may be frankly admitted. That he had {{elements}} of greatness is also without question; and precisely for this reason, because his power is so often manifest in noble or exquisite passages, there is disappointment in reading him when we stumble upon bad rimes, careless workmanship, mishandling of his native speech. Our experience here is probably like that of Whittier's friend Garrison. The latter had read certain poems that attracted him; he came quickly to see the poet; and <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> the barn, <b>his</b> clothes sprinkled with hayseed, crawled a shy country lad who explained bashfully {{that he had been}} hunting hens' nests. Anything could be forgiven after that; interest in the boy would surely temper criticism of the poet.|$|R
60|$|The {{next night}} Bunny played us another trick. Before Simmo {{went to sleep}} he always took off his blue {{overalls}} and put them under his head for a pillow. That {{was only one of}} Simmo's queer ways. While he was asleep the rabbits came into his little commoosie, dragged the overalls <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> head, and nibbled them full of holes. Not content with this, they played with them all night; pulled them around the clearing, as threads here and there plainly showed; then dragged them away into the underbrush and left them.|$|E
60|$|Puck had {{raced up}} after her, {{and had come}} poking and snuffling round Alfred. She would have called him away lest he should {{be too much for}} one so weak, but she saw Alfred really did enjoy this: his hand was in the long rough coat, and he was whispering, 'Poor Puck,' and 'Good little doggie;' and the little hairy rummaging creature, with the bright black beads of eyes gleaming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> shaggy hair, was doing him more good than her sense and kindness, or Ellen's either.|$|E
60|$|But the old {{man said}} never a word. First of all he drew a great circle with strange figures, marking it with his finger upon the ground. Then <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> red gown he brought a tinder-box and steel, and a little silver casket covered all over with strange figures of serpents and dragons and what not. He brought some sticks of spice-wood from his pouch, and then he struck a light and made a fire. Out of the box he took a gray powder, which he flung upon the little blaze.|$|E
5000|$|The Penguin {{appears in}} Lego Batman: The Videogame, with his vocal effects {{provided}} by Tom Kenny. He {{is one of}} the leaders of the Arkham breakout. His plan is to use mind-controlled penguins to wreak havoc in Gotham. To this end, he employs the Catwoman, Bane, Killer Croc, and the Man-Bat. He has the ability to call <b>out</b> robotic penguins <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> top hat. He can use his umbrella both as a gliding apparatus and a rifle. Despite his comic book appearance he has some ideas and characteristics of Danny DeVito's Penguin (e.g. taking over Gotham with a penguin army, having a liking for raw fish, and working with Catwoman). Being a Lego game, he cannot be portrayed as fat, nor does he have his signature pointed nose.|$|R
60|$|There {{were not}} two dragon sentries keeping ward before {{the gate of}} this above, as in magic legend are usually found on duty over the wronged innocence imprisoned; but besides a glowering visage, with its thin lips parted wickedly, that {{surveyed}} all comers from above the archway of the door, there was a monstrous fantasy of rusty iron, curling and twisting like a petrifaction of an arbour over threshold, budding in spikes and corkscrew points, and bearing, one on either side, two ominous extinguishers, that seemed to say, 'Who enter here, leave light behind!' There were no talismanic characters engraven on the portal, but the house was now so neglected in appearance, that boys chalked the railings and the pavement--particularly round the corner where the side wall was--and drew ghosts on the stable door; and being sometimes driven off by Mr Towlinson, made portraits of him, in return, with his ears growing <b>out</b> horizontally <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> hat. Noise ceased to be, within {{the shadow of the}} roof. The brass band that came into the street once a week, in the morning, never brayed a note in at those windows; but all such company, down to a poor little piping organ of weak intellect, with an imbecile party of automaton dancers, waltzing in and out at folding-doors, fell off from it with one accord, and shunned it as a hopeless place.|$|R
6000|$|Nay {{there is}} one death-doer, of the ancient Meot sort, who, with effort, has done even less and worse: slain a Deputy, and set all the Patriotism of Paris on edge! It was five on Saturday evening when Lepelletier St. Fargeau, having given his vote, No Delay, ran over to Fevrier's in the Palais Royal to snatch a morsel of dinner. He had dined, and was paying. A thickset man 'with black hair and blue beard,' in a loose kind of frock, stept up to him; it was, as Fevrier and the {{bystanders}} bethought them, one Paris of the old King's-Guard. [...] "Are you Lepelletier?" [...] asks he.--"Yes."--"You voted in the King's Business?"--"I voted Death."--"Scelerat, take that!" [...] cries Paris, flashing <b>out</b> a sabre <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>his</b> frock, and plunging it deep in Lepelletier's side. Fevrier clutches him; but he breaks off; is gone.|$|R
