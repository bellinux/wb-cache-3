40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} optimization {{of the cable}} lengths in trawls {{with respect to the}} ratio between the estimated trawl drag and the predicted catch efficiency is developed and applied. The trawl cables of interest are warps, bridles, headline and footrope. The optimization algorithm applies an ordered sequential process changing one cable length at the time. It is assumed in the predictions that the catch efficiency of the trawl is proportional with the trawl mouth area. In a case study optimizing a bottom trawl used on a research vessel by applying the new method it is predicted that {{it would be possible to}} reduce the ratio between trawl drag and catch efficiency by up to 46 % by optimizing the cable lengths. Thus this would enable a considerable reduction in fuel consumption to catch a specific amount of fish. Moreover, we predict an increase in the value of the trawl mouth area leading to better catching efficiency without increase in <b>otter</b> <b>door</b> drag.

40|$|Whole-gear {{efficiency}} (the {{proportion of}} fish passing between the <b>otter</b> <b>doors</b> of a bottom trawl that are subsequently captured) was estimated from data collected during experiments {{to measure the}} herding efficiency of bridles and doors, the capture efficiency of the net, {{and the length of}} the bridles sufficiently close to the seafloor to elicit a herding response. The experiments were focused on four species of flatfish: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). Whole-gear efficiency varied with fish length and reached maximum values between 40 % and 50 % for arrowtooth flounder, flathead sole, and rex sole. For Dover sole, however, whole-gear efficiency declined from a maximum of 33 % over the length range sampled. Such efficiency estimates can be used to determine catchability, which, in turn, can be used to improve the accuracy of stock assessment models when the time series of a survey is short...|$|R
40|$|Survey {{standardization}} procedures {{can reduce}} the variability in trawl catch efficiency thus producing more precise estimates of biomass. One such procedure, towing with equal amounts of trawl warp {{on both sides of}} the net, was experimentally investigated for its importance in determining optimal trawl geometry and for evaluating the effectiveness of the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) national protocol on accurate measurement of trawl warps. This recent standard for measuring warp length requires that the difference between warp lengths can be no more than 4 % of the distance between the <b>otter</b> <b>doors</b> measured along the bridles and footrope. Trawl performance data from repetitive towing with warp differentials of 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 20 m were analyzed for their effect on three determinants of flatfish catch efficiency: footrope distance off-bottom, bridle length in contact with the bottom, and area swept by the net. Our results indicated that the distortion of the trawl caused by asymmetry in trawl warp length could have a negative inf luence on flatfish catch efficiency. At a difference of 7 m in warp length, the NOAA 4 % threshold value for the 83112 Eastern survey trawl used in our study, we found no effect on the acous-tic-based measures of door spread, wing spread, and headrope height off-bottom. However, the sensitivity of the trawl to 7 m of warp offset could be seen as footrope distances off-bottom increased slightly (particularly in the center region of the net where flatfish escapement is highest), and as the width of the bridle path responsible for flatfish herding, together with the effective net width, was reduced. For this survey trawl, a NOAA threshold value of 4 % should be considered a maximum. A more conservative value (less than 4 %) would likely reduce potential bias in estimates of relative abundance caused by large differences in warp length approaching 7 m...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{dedicated}} trawling {{experiment was}} performed at three {{sites on the}} Gulf of Lion continental shelf, {{with the aim of}} assessing the resuspension of particulate and dissolved matter triggered by different types of trawls on muddy sediments. The different configurations were: (i) bottom trawl, with bobbin for ground rope (Rockhopper) : (ii) bottom trawl, without bobbin (Medits); and (iii) pelagic trawl, towed at 1 and 10 m above the seabed.;The plumes of resuspended sediment were measured using the acoustic backscattered intensity, from a towed ADCP. Concomitant profiles of particle size-distribution, light transmission and water samples were collected, outside and inside the plumes. The analysis of the data enabled derivation of the major physical and chemical characteristics of the plumes generated by the trawls; likewise, and to quantify the resuspension fluxes of sediment, particulate (PN, POC) and dissolved (nutrients) elements. The residence time and dispersal of the plumes were monitored and modelled, considering the settling velocity of the particulate matter and the near-bottom turbulence.;The results indicate that the bottom trawls produce significant resuspension, whilst the near-bottom and mid-water pelagic trawls have no impact upon the sediment. The sediment clouds at several hundreds metres astern of the bottom trawls are 3 - 6 m high and 70 - 200 m, wide; they were generated both by the <b>otter</b> <b>doors</b> and the net. The average suspended sediment concentrations measured in the plumes reach 50 mg l(- 1). Resuspension fluxes of sediment along the path of the trawls range from 190 g m(- 2) s(- 1), for the coarsest sediment (clayey silt) to 800 g m(- 2) s(- 1) for the finest sediment (silty clay). Whilst the resuspended loads of dissolved elements (nutrients) within the plume segment suggest a release of porewater, present at least in the first few centimetres of sediment, the particulate matter load only resulted from the resuspension of less than 1 mm thickness of the sediment bed. This discrepancy shows that a very small fraction of the sediment ploughed by the trawl is effectively injected into the water column.;The monitoring of the settling of the plumes indicates a rapid decay of the sediment load, during the first hour after its generation. Some of the sediment (about 10 - 15 % of the initial load) remains in suspension; this is due, probably, to the near-bottom turbulence that prevents the redeposition of the fine particles and aggregates. Lateral spreading of the plume is strongly dependent upon the variability of horizontal currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
