40|$|The process {{makes it}} {{possible}} to biologically treat <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> <b>wastewaters</b> (OMW) at low dilution and high organic load rate in spite of their high content of inhibitory compounds, namely lipidic and phenolic ones. The process is based on combination of physical-chemical and biological (anaerobic) treatment in a single and simultaneous step. The physical-chemical part of the process is based on the addition of natural sorbents and chemicals which regulate the inhibitory compounds at non inhibitory concentration while still leaving them available for biodegradation. Thus OMW conversion to methane can be obtained at high organic load rate (up to 8. 2 kg COD m- 3 d- 1) even though the feed is very little diluted (1 : 1. 5). Very good performance is obtained (total COD removal : 91 %; methane yield : 0. 80 g CH 4 (as COD) / g removed COD; lipids removal: 98 %; phenols removal: 63 %). Moreover, the addition of natural sorbents and chemicals introduce neither any sophisticated reactor engineering nor treatment or disposal of concentrated or toxic side streams...|$|R

The Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnation. Those products were characterized by N 2 adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma. Catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was performed in a batch reactor at 140  °C and 50  bar of air. Our results show that the most efficient catalyst was Ru with a Ce/Ti ratio of 1 / 5, which converted totally p-hydroxybenzoic after 7  h of reaction without Ru leaching. We explain this finding by an enhanced dispersion of Ru due to better structural properties of the CeO 2 –TiO 2 support. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Ligninolytic enzymes were better produced in glucose based medium with a low nitrogen level (2. 2 mM) under O 2 atmosphere. The addition of 5 mM veratryl alcohol resulted in a maximal production of LiP, whereas maximal MnP and laccase were obtained at 10 mM. LiP production was totally repressed in presence of 100 microM Mn 2 +. The extrapolation of these conditions on OOMW based media was carried out at different effluent dilutions and the possible role of the different ligninolytic enzymes in OOMW decolourisation was studied. A better effluent decolourisation was obtained under LiP induction condition (5 mM veratryl alcohol) than when LiP was repressed (100 microM Mn 2 +). Furthermore, high levels of laccase had a detrimental effect on OOMW decolourisation concomitant to the formation of soluble polymeric aromatic compounds. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

It {{was concluded that}} codigestion of OMW with DPM is possible without any dilution of OMW or addition of any chemicals. Biogas production was slightly higher when OMW was added to DPM up to a critical concentration (about 40 %, expressed as contribution of OMW to the volatile solids of the mixture), after which production is decreased. The results were further verified by scaling up to a continuously-operating pilot-plant reactor digesting DPM, and confirmed that no negative impact was imposed by adding OMW up to the above critical value.

40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> <b>wastewaters</b> (OMWW) are {{the main}} liquid {{effluents}} generated by the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> production industry. This liquid, considered pollutant and toxic, is characterised by its high content of organic matter including mainly sugars and fats, and phenols compounds, {{which can be used}} in ruminants feeding. The {{purpose of this study is}} to valorise this agricultural by-product in ruminant feeding by estimation its in vitro degradability in presence of ovine ruminale microbiota comparatively to vetch-oat hay, using in vitro gas production technique coupled with NH 3 -N and protozoa measurements. Cumulative gas production was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of incubation. The determination of gazes produced (carbon dioxide and methane) was recorded at 6, 9, 24, 48 and 96 hours. However, Ammonia and protozoa number were recorded after 24 hours of incubation. Fermentation profile was fitted to the exponential model y = a + b (1 – e-kt). The OMWW are characterized by their high sugars content (39. 91 %) and their low content in ash (1. 99 %) and crude protein (2. 70 %). This by-product is also characterized by its high concentration in total phenols (7. 2 %) and tannins (4. 5 %). However, they contain a very small amount of condensed tannins (0. 89 %). Comparatively to vetch-oat hay, OMWW produced low amount of gas (- 23. 6 units). Furthermore, its in vitro fermentation generates low volume of methane (9. 83 %, V/V), suggesting that the OMWW nature enhanced the efficiency of ruminale microbiota towards microbial biomass production and inhibition of ruminale methanogenesis pathway. This result is reinforced by the reduction of ammonia production (- 0. 35 units) and protozoa proliferation (- 1 unit) comparatively to vetch-oat hay. The anaerobic biodegradation of OMWW reveal their significant use by the rumen microbiota, allowing us to strongly recommend its use as a supplement in feed ruminant. In addition, it allows considering using this residue as a feed additive in diets of ruminants for the reduction of ruminal methanogenesis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>oil</b> is {{the main}} fat {{ingredient}} in the traditional Mediterranean diet mainly due to their antioxidant properties, the benefits associated with the regulation of cholesterol levels and prevention of cardiovascular diseases [1]. During the production of Virgin <b>Olive</b> <b>Oil</b> (VOO) large amounts of wastes, namely <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> <b>wastewaters</b> (OMWW) are produced constituting a severe environmental problem in Mediterranean countries [2]. The main organic composition of OMWW comprises sugars, nitrogenous compounds, volatile acids, polyalcohols, pectins, fats and polyphenols [3]. The increasing interest on natural antioxidants combined with the recognized bioactivity of olive polyphenols makes OMWW very attractive as a potent source of natural antioxidants [1, 4]. The valuable healthy benefits associated to polyphenols demonstrated by several studies that support their biological properties, in particular on the reduction of oxidative stress, has stimulated the research on technological strategies to extract and isolate those bioactive compounds. The development of analytical methodologies that enable the recovery of phenolic compounds from OMWW represents an analytical challenge mainly due to the inherent complexity of the matrix. In recent years, aiming to introduce reliable methodologies to achieve that purposes, several attempts have been performed mainly focused on extraction procedures, membrane separation, centrifugation and chromatography, being those techniques used individually or in a combined form [5]. Most of the analytical procedures developed have been mainly focused on the recovery of some polyphenols that possess a more powerful antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties, such as hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleuropein and phenolic acids. Nowadays, the research on analytical methodologies based on molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective recovery of phenolic compounds from OMWW has emerged as an innovative technology enabling the selective extraction and isolation of target molecules from the OMWW complex matrix which represents a valuable process in terms of further enhancing the waste valorization [6 - 8]. The scope of this review {{is to provide a}} general overview on the most used techniques for the recovery of polyphenols from <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> waste with special emphasis on the application of MIP technology and also its potential impact on the field of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> waste valorization...|$|R
