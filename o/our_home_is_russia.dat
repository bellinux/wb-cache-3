5000|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> - <b>Russia</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1995 by then Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a liberal, centrist {{political}} movement, founded {{for the purpose}} of rallying more technocratic-reformist (right-wing) government supporters. At the time of its founding, Chernomyrdin had the backing of Russian president Boris Yeltsin along with numerous large financial institutions such as Association of Russian Banks, and major companies such as Gazprom, of which he was formerly the chairman. The movement attracted the sympathies and interests of many prominent members of the ruling elite of <b>Russia,</b> and NDR <b>was</b> thus nicknamed [...] "the party of power". It was also known as the party of the Oligarchs, the position previously identified with another political party, Russia's Choice. Two other parties were interested in cooperating with NDR after its foundation: parts of the Agrarian Party of Russia and Democratic Choice of Russia. Together their platform would promote [...] "freedom, property, and legality", and would favor such policies as reducing the state's role in the economy, support for small businesses, privatization of agriculture, and military cutbacks. However, after Chernomyrdin's candidacy for a second term as Prime Minister was in 1998 rejected by the Duma, <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> - Russia declined the other parties' bid for cooperation. Although it was critical of the war in Chechnya, Viktor Chernomyrdin and NDR {{played a central role in}} supporting Yeltsin in his 1996 bid for re-election as President of the Russian Federation. [...] "To sum up why <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> - <b>Russia</b> <b>is</b> for Yeltsin, I can say only one thing--because we are for reforms, for the constitution of Russia, for peace in Chechnya, for a normal life in Russia," [...] Chernomyrdin told Itar-Tass news agency in 1996.|$|R

50|$|Our Home - Russia had weightier {{resources}} and soon acquired the nicknameof “party of power” for {{its reliance on}} elite political and economic officeholders. It was {{also referred to as}} “Our Home Is Gazprom” for its close ties toGazprom’s substantial financial resources. Most of the cabinet ministers joinedthe bloc, and a number of business leaders and regional political elites affiliatedwith it. However, almost no other parties entered it, and many SMD candidateswho had initially affiliated with the party soon left it. One of the early partiesto enter the bloc, Sergei Shakhrai’s Party of Russian Unity and Accord, alsodeserted it in August. In the election, the OurHome Is Russia bloc took 10.1% of the vote, enough to form a faction in theDuma but not enough to serve as a dominant or pivotal force in parliament orin the regions. At its peak, the party claimed the membership of around onethird of Russia’s governors.

50|$|The party's {{stance on}} Yegor Gaidar's {{economic}} reforms was ambiguous, but developed more {{critical in the}} course of time. During the constitutional crisis in Russia (1992-93), the party did not have unanimous position. The party called for balloting both for re-election of the President {{as well as of the}} legislative bodies on the referendum in April 1993; however, some of the party's leaders took the pro-Yeltsin side. Similarly, during the October 1993 events in Moscow, Travkin initially supported the so-called zero variant (annulling both Yeltsin's decree nr 1400 and the Supreme Soviet's subsequent decisions). On 4 October, Travkin supported Yeltsin's actions in suppressing the armed rebellion. The party took part in the Russian legislative election, 1993 and won 14 seats. The party split, however, on the issue of support for the Chernomyrdin cabinet. Travkin who took a more conciliatory stand lost the power struggle to Govorukhin and Glazyev, who were determined opponents of the government course, and Travkin consequently left the party and joined the <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>is</b> <b>Russia</b> movement.|$|E
