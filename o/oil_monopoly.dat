The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever.

Updating these regulations to allow for current vehicles to modify their engines would allow for a near-term, widespread expansion of fuel choice for drivers. Ethanol, methanol, natural gas and electric cars are seen as viable replacement fuels to compete against oil in an open market.

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, a middle class had {{developed}} that was leery of both the business elite and the somewhat radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. Known as Progressives, these people favored government regulation of business practices to, in their minds, ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), Democrat President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Ida M. Tarbell wrote a series of articles against the Standard <b>Oil</b> <b>monopoly.</b> The series helped pave the way for the breakup of the monopoly.|$|E

Bajatović took part in several further deals with Gazprom after this time, and in late 2009 he indicated Serbia's ambition to become a major hub for the distribution of Russian gas in Europe. In November 2009, Srbijagas and Gazprom registered a joint company called Juzni Tok Srbija (South Stream Serbia). The South Stream project ultimately collapsed but has since been replaced by the successor projects Turkish Stream and Tesla Pipeline.|$|E
