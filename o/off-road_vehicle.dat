5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E

25|$|Human {{recreational}} activities, such as <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> near wetlands, {{are also}} damaging its habitat. Lakes and streams are enjoyable areas for recreation, but human activity {{in these areas}} can degrade them. The use of <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in or around wetlands, however, is the most damaging recreational activity. Mud bogging significantly damages and destroys these areas. Also, oil and gasoline from <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{has been found in}} snake habitats.|$|R

The objective methods for determining ride comfort including the Average Absorbed Power, BS 6841, VDI 2057 and ISO 2631 were investigated.

25|$|The Sierra Club's {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} see the plovers taken off of the threatened species list. To accomplish this, they proposed year-round fencing to protect plover habitat, but the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area rejected the idea. Soon after the decision, a plover was killed by an <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a recommended area for fencing. The Sierra Club sued the State Parks for violating the ESA by not providing enough protection for the snowy plover, {{as well as the}} California least tern and steelhead trout.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 Land Rover {{launched}} a second iteration station wagon, this time {{aimed at the}} commercial user who needed an <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> for carrying passengers without car-like comforts. Based on the commercial panel van variant Land Rover, it had seats fitted to the load space and windows cut into the sides. While available with features such as an interior light, heater, door and floor trims and upgraded seats, the station wagon retained the base vehicle's tough and capable suspension - {{as well as its}} mediocre road performance.|$|E
25|$|The Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) {{formerly}} known as the Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV), is a U.S. Army proposed air-droppable light <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> to improve the mobility of light infantry brigades. In March 2015, the Army changed the name of the ULCV to the Ground Mobility Vehicle. GMV is intended to be carried internally in a CH-47 Chinook or externally by a UH-60 Black Hawk. In order to be survivable but transportable, the GMV would be lightly armored and use speed, maneuverability, and off-road mobility to avoid major threats.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, a Mini Moke {{was the first}} motor vehicle to be driven on Pitcairn Island and thereby became the most remote vehicle on Earth. It was chosen {{because it was the}} only <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> that could be lifted by the island's only crane—there being no dock or {{airstrip}} at Pitcairn. However, the rough terrain and heavy rainfall proved too much for the Moke and it soon broke down. Eventually, a second and later a third Moke were sent to the island, and by cannibalising the three for spares, the island's sole vehicle remained running until at least 1988.|$|E
25|$|Lamborghini grew rapidly {{during its}} first ten years, but sales plunged {{in the wake of}} the 1973 {{worldwide}} financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The concern {{felt by the}} Sierra Club's Santa Lucia Chapter lies in the {{management}} of the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area. <b>Off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> use partially conflicts with habitat of the western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) and it is alleged that this directly correlates with a decrease in reproductive success. However, western snowy plover nests have increased dramatically from 16 nests in 1993 to a total of 172 nests in 2011. An eight-year summary of western snowy plover reproduction on California State Park lands depicts the breeding success at Oceano Dunes which is particularly stark compared to very low breeding numbers elsewhere in the state. The western snowy plover was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on March 5, 1993.|$|E

500|$|The Shoshone people {{occupied}} the forest before European settlers {{arrived in the}} early 19th century. Many of the early settlers were trappers and prospectors before gold was discovered in 1862.

Recreation facilities include over 70 campgrounds, whitewater and flatwater boating, cabin rentals, and [...] of trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and motorized <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> use.

He settled in Santa Monica, California, to concentrate on audio electronics ideas. However, everynow and then he was called as consultant by Springsteen staff and Clair Bros to solve acoustic issues during the following world tours, for instance in Verona, Italy (1993).|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Stebbins became {{concerned}} about the impacts that increasingly popular <b>off-road</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ORV) driving was having on desert ecosystems of southern California—witnessing environmental degradation {{in some of the}} same places he had studied during graduate school—and became actively involved in over a decade of conservation efforts. Stebbins and colleagues studied the diversity of organisms in and around ORV areas, communicated research to Bureau of Land Management officials, and petitioned President Jimmy Carter to limit all-terrain vehicle use in deserts. Stebbins faced opposition from ORV riders and their lobbyists: American Motorcyclist magazine called him a [...] "staunch abolitionist in the war against motorized vehicles in the desert." [...] Stebbins' efforts eventually helped secure the passing of the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 which established the Mojave National Preserve and elevated Joshua Tree and Death Valley from national monuments to more protected national parks. [...] In 1998 Stebbins was recognized in the U.S. Congress by Representative George Miller and the Contra Costa Times as one of 10 environmental leaders deemed [...] "national treasures" [...] for their activism.|$|E
