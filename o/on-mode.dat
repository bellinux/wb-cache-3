In November 2008, television specifications were improved to limit <b>on-mode</b> power use, {{in addition to}} standby power which {{is limited by the}} current specifications.

40|$|Post-launch {{performance}} analysis {{carried out to}} characterize spatial and radiometric aspects of IRS-CARTOSAT- 1 is reported in this paper. The radiometric characteristics are estimated with scene dynamic range analysis, signal-to-noise ratio, impact of onboard data compression on image quality, and the spatial characteristics is by modulation transfer function (MTF). Histograms of about 42 scenes comprising of different land-cover features across the country were computed to estimate overall and most significant dynamic ranges of the sensor output. Similarly, the signal-to-noise ratios were estimated by visually selecting uniform target areas viz., water body, tar-road and snow to study the sensor radiometry at low, middle and high input signal levels. Also, the effect of JPEG data compression onboard (Compression Ratio = 1 : 3. 2) on the data quality was studied by analyzing the satellite data over the same area with compression off- and <b>on-modes</b> of data acquisition. The MTF was estimated base on slant-edge algorithm, which allows to extract edge information at sub-pixel level for accurate estimation of the edge profile. The MTF was evaluated using the slant edge algorithm on an image edge over an airstrip target. It {{was found that the}} sensors onboard CARTOSAT- 1 spacecraft has met all the mission set specifications, and would help to generate data products with adequate image sharpness, radiometric quality and insignificant image distortion due to onboard compression scheme to extract cartographic feature extraction and analysis...|$|R

40|$|Most {{developed}} {{countries in the}} world now have television ownership levels approaching or exceeding 2 per household and this appears to be increasing. Even developing countries like China have an ownership of 1. 33 televisions per household in urban areas. It is estimated that 1 billion televisions were installed world wide by 1996 and with annual production running at more than 200 million units a year, the world stock is already likely to more than 2 billion. CRT televisions form the bulk of the existing stock of televisions, but it is estimated that new technologies such as LCD and plasma will become the majority of new sales by 2010. Increasing screen sizes and high <b>on-mode</b> energy consumption of new technology televisions and their peripherals is likely to result in a marked increase in the energy consumption televisions. Analysis has shown that there is a factor of 2 or 3 (or more) between the lowest and highest energy models of the same technology and size (based on analysis of hundreds of models). This suggests a strong case for providing information to consumers on these differences (e. g. some form of energy labeling) and/or mandating efficiency standards (MEPS). While standby is generally improving, the increase in <b>on-mode</b> energy consumption will mostly likely swamp any benefits...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) is a {{new technology}} used to generate gamma photons in X-ray tubes. CNTs, in comparison to other small X-ray sources, produce high X-ray intensities and as they are not based on a thermionic principle they considered cold electron sources with a very high conversion of electrical to photon energy. Their small size and other interesting properties could make them feasible for use in intraoperative radiation therapy applications. In this study, physical characteristics of the photon beam generated by the CNT-based X-ray source were assessed. A soft X-ray ionization chamber and a flat panel detector {{was used to measure}} dose and photon counts, respectively. The repetitively produced pulses had almost the same photon intensities with differences of less than 1 % between them. For a typical selected pulse, the variation in the pulse amplitude was also insignificant, which shows a stable radiation exposure of the tube during the <b>ON-mode.</b> When moving {{from the center of the}} beam profile to the lateral distance of 25 mm, both intensity profile and dose profile showed a falling trend by a factor of almost 3 in the measured values...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made in CMOS RF-switches {{that can be used in}} the {{front-end}} of a multi-band radio targeting the 802. 11 a,b,g and W-CDMA standards and working in the frequency range 2. 4 - 5. 5 GHz. Especially, one single-transistor switch and two types of transmission gates have been analyzed, simulated and compared with respect to loss, linearity, compression point and noise. From this, five different single-transistor switches have been designed for on-chip probing measurements. Special consideration has been taken to accommodate on-chip testing, thus additional structures have been designed. The simulations and design has been performed with Chartered 0. 18 um RF-CMOS process. The results from the simulations show that the single-transistor switch has better performance in loss, linearity, compression point and noise compared to the transmission gates. However, for the transmission gates the linearity can be increased beyond the linearity of the single-transistor switch if the widths of the transistors are made sufficiently large. For the single-transistor switch, simulation results show that the transistor length shall be kept to its minimum for best performance and that the number of fingers does not influence significantly. Also, there are optimum values for the loss in <b>on-mode,</b> the noise and the linearity and worst-case values for the loss in off-mode when the transistor width is varied. Consequently, the single- transistor switch can be tuned by its transistor width to accommodate desired performances...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{developments}} in digital TV and broadband communication will have a large impact on residential energy consumption if no adequate policy actions are implemented. The European Union has established a successful stakeholder forum through its Codes of Conduct for Energy Efficiency. This forum agrees on power levels for defined operating modes, and provides further guidelines, e. g. on power management, to achieve desirable efficiency levels. Two Codes of Conduct are in operation: the Code of Conduct for Digital TV Service Systems (since 2001) and the Code of Conduct for External Power Supplies (since 2003). In 2005, the first draft of a Code of Conduct for Broadband Equipment was presented at the stakeholder forum. Together, it is projected that these Codes of Conduct will save 20 TWh per year from 2010. This paper reports on the first results for the Codes of Conduct for Digital TV Service Systems and Power Supplies, based on data from participating manufacturers. Analysis of the data shows a considerable overall improvement in power consumption, not only in the standby modes but also in the <b>on-mode.</b> Furthermore, the paper shows how discussion with stakeholders based on a common road map provides guidelines for the continuous development of this innovative policy tool and leads to the efficient adoption of the new criteria required to mitigate the energy impact of the new features and functions in the product that are prompted by rapid technological development and market forces.
