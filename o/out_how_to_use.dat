25|$|In 1961, Osamu Shimomura {{extracted}} {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) {{and another}} bioluminescent protein, called aequorin, from the large and abundant hydromedusa Aequorea victoria, while studying photoproteins that cause bioluminescence in this species. Three decades later, Douglas Prasher sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP. Martin Chalfie figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> GFP as a fluorescent marker of genes inserted into other cells or organisms. Roger Tsien later chemically manipulated GFP to produce other fluorescent colors to use as markers. In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work with GFP.|$|E
25|$|During Teen Titans, Superboy {{developed}} Kryptonian powers including heat vision, x-ray vision, and super-hearing. He {{also developed}} Kryptonian invulnerability. He also has developed Kryptonian level super strength, as shown when he battled the hugely powerful Superboy-Prime and {{even managed to}} damage him {{with some of his}} blows, when some characters such as Black Adam could not. When the Titans encountered their future selves, he found his future self had greater telekinetic abilities (no longer limited to tactile telekinesis), was stronger, more durable, and faster. Superboy later states that he has developed telescopic vision and eventually figures <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his freeze breath. It has also been shown in Teen Titans that he is much faster, traveling from San Francisco to the Arctic {{in less than an hour}} whilst carrying Nightwing. Superboy, like Superman, derives his Kryptonian powers from the absorption of solar energy from the Earth's yellow sun, and he is as vulnerable to Kryptonite and magic as is the Man of Steel.|$|E
25|$|As {{the souls}} that Sam {{is sent to}} {{apprehend}} have already died once (along {{with the fact that}} they have various paranormal abilities), an attempt to capture or even kill them by a mere mortal could prove almost impossible. The Devil provides Sam with vessels to help him do his work. The vessel is usually sent for Sam to open in a wooden box which varies in shape per episode, sometimes inappropriate for the vessel they hold (i.e. a large box contained a Zippo lighter vessel) and it's usually up to Sam to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it to capture the escaped soul assigned for him to apprehend since the vessels don't usually come with an instruction manual. All vessels are unique because each of them is intended to capture the escaped soul for whom they were created and intended to confine. The vessel could even be a seemingly living thing (e.g. a live dove).|$|E

25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E
500|$|The player {{must use}} {{resource}} management to survive. Items that help sustain the player, {{such as food}} and healing items, are in limited supply, and the player must figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> these most advantageously {{in order to survive}} in the dungeon. USGamer further considers [...] "stamina decay" [...] as another feature related to resource management. The player's character constantly needs to find food to survive or will die from hunger, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns {{for a long period of}} time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons. Rich Carlson, one of the creators of an early roguelike-like Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, called this aspect a sort of [...] "clock", imposing some type of deadline or limitation on how much the player can explore and creating tension in the game.|$|E

I think that's {{the difference between the two}} of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E

He described GIMP's scripting as one of its strengths, but also remarked that some of Photoshop's features - such as Text, 3D commands, Adjustment Layers and History - are either less powerful or missing in GIMP. Cardinal favorably described the UFRaw converter for raw images used with GIMP, noting that it still [...] "requires some patience to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> those more advanced capabilities". Cardinal stated that GIMP is [...] "easy enough to try" [...] despite not having as well developed documentation and help system as those for Photoshop, concluding that it [...] "has become a worthy alternative to Photoshop for anyone on a budget who doesn’t need all of Photoshop’s vast feature set".|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese {{during the}} ancient Han Dynasty {{were also the}} first to apply {{hydraulic}} power (i.e. a waterwheel) in working the inflatable bellows of the blast furnace. This was recorded in the year 31 AD, an innovation of the engineer Du Shi, prefect of Nanyang. Although Du Shi {{was the first to}} apply water power to bellows in metallurgy, the first drawn and printed illustration of its operation with water power came in 1313, in the Yuan Dynasty era text called the Nong Shu. [...] In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques: a [...] "berganesque" [...] method that produced inferior, heterogeneous steel and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast. By the 11th century, there was also a large amount of deforestation in China due to the iron industry's demands for charcoal. However, by this time the Chinese had figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> bituminous coke to replace the use of charcoal, and with this switch in resources many acres of prime timberland in China were spared. This switch in resources from charcoal to coal was later used in Europe by the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker wrote a mixed {{review of}} the series. Favoring it over Cumming's series on NBC, Nussbaum praised the {{character}} Max as something new for network television, highlighting her {{sense of humor and}} her contrasting nature to that of Whitneys lead character. However, she was critical of the racial strereotype present in the series and the series' setting. Nussbaum positively concluded, [...] "there's so much potential here it kills me—a deep female friendship, raw humor about class, and a show that puts young women's sexuality dead center, rather than using it as visual spice, as in some cable series about bad-boy antiheroes." [...] The A.V. Club writer Todd VanDerWerff, in his {{review of the}} series finale, was critical of the series for not living up to the potential present in the series' pilot episode and noted that [...] "still hasn't figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the ensemble, though at least it doesn't seem to have something out for all of the male supporting [...] characters." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict praised the lead actresses' chemistry but ultimately found it [...] "repetitive, broad, grating and, more often than not, just stupid." [...] Browley was also critical [...] of the racial content and stereotypes present in the series. Aaron Peck, writing for High-Def Digest, wrote the first season release as [...] "one to avoid." [...] Deeming the season [...] "pure comedic blasphemy", Peck panned the comedic content and use of stereotyping and racism, deeming the characters alongside Max and Caroline [...] "the most racially insensitive depictions" [...] thought up.|$|E
