40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} perspective, the primary function of <b>insulation</b> <b>oils</b> is to dissipate heat, and {{it serves as}} an insulator in between turn-to-turn windings in power transformers. To date, the majority of power transformer failures is attributed to the physicochemical reaction {{that takes place in}} the <b>insulation</b> <b>oils</b> due to the presence of heat, moisture content, oxidation and electrical stresses. Knowing that moisture content is one of the factors that leads to the degradation of transformer <b>insulation</b> <b>oils,</b> the main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of moisture content on the breakdown voltage and Fourier transform infrared spectral characteristics of transformer <b>insulation</b> <b>oils.</b> Two types of <b>insulation</b> <b>oils</b> are chosen for this study: (1) conventional mineral-based <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> and (2) palm oil-based <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> which is a relatively new substitute for mineral-based <b>insulation</b> <b>oils</b> in Malaysia. The effects of moisture content is investigated by varying the amount of distilled water added into the oil samples from 1 to 5 ml, with an increment of 1 ml. Breakdown voltage test is conducted six times and the mean breakdown voltage is determined for each oil sample. The spectral characteristics of the oil samples are determined by means of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The breakdown voltage test and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry is carried out in accordance with the MS IEC 60156 : 2012 and ASTM D 2144 standards, ensuring the reliability of the test procedures. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that moisture content has a significant effect on the breakdown voltage and spectral characteristics of mineral and palm oil-based <b>insulation</b> <b>oils</b> - however, the effect is more pronounced for the mineral oil samples. Analysis of the Fourier transform infrared spectra reveals that the chemical composition of PFAE oil samples is not significantly influenced by moisture content and thus, this oil is a promising alternative for use as <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> in power transformers...|$|R

Although mineral <b>oil</b> based <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> is the common liquid dielectric used in power transformers, environmental and safety issues are pressurizing many stakeholders from developed countries to consider alternative fluid as transformer fluids. Vegetable (natural ester) based <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> is a viable alternative that has been commercialized in some countries. This paper presents results from the study done to ascertain the feasibility of using commercially available biodegradable <b>insulation</b> <b>oil</b> (Envirotemp® FR 3 ™) for Malaysia power transformers.

40|$|The {{three most}} common {{condition}} monitoring techniques {{were applied to}} laboratory test configurations that simulate biodegradable oil-filled transformer insulation system. The tested techniques were Dissolved Gas-in-oil Analysis (DGA), Partial Discharge (PD) detection and Polarization and Depolarization Current (POC) measurement. Dissolved hydro-carbon gas products generated by three fault types, arcing, overheating and partial discharge faults in biodegradable oil, were analysed according to the OGA technique. In the PO technique, discharge activities in biodegradable <b>oil</b> <b>insulation</b> were monitored using the standard phase resolved analysis method. The levels of PO activities and patterns of PO distributions in biodegradable oil were identified and analysed. The POC patterns of biodegradable oil at different moisture levels and after faults were analysed to obtain information {{on the level of}} conductivity, the dielectric response function and the moisture level of the oil. The biodegradable <b>oil</b> <b>insulation</b> system was found to have significantly different test results when compared to the mineral <b>oil</b> <b>insulation</b> system. Existing condition-monitoring techniques can be used to monitor biodegradable oil filled transformers but the fault identification and diagnosis for each technique needs to be modified. Thus new improvements were developed through this research to help achieve more accurate fault identification and prediction for biodegradable oil-filled transformers. Through the PO detection method, corona and surface discharge phase-resolved patterns in biodegradable <b>oil</b> <b>insulation</b> and their statistical parameters were identified. This enabled discrimination between these two types of discharge activities. As biodegradable oil has different trends of gas formation during faults, new versions of two OGA fault gas interpretation methods were proposed (the Duval Triangle and Roger's Ratio methods). These fault predictions were developed based on the fault gases released by biodegradable oil during faults in the presence and absence of pressboard and at different moisture levels. These new versions of fault gas interpretation methods will allow more accurate fault prediction for biodegradable oil transformer applications. Based on POC measurements of the biodegradable oil in a healthy oil condition at different moisture levels and after faults, fault identification can be achieved by comparing the PDC pattern of an oil sample against the PDC fingerprints. Furthermore, the relationship curves between the oil moisture level toward its conductivity level and measured capacitance value have been established. These curves can be used to predict the oil moisture condition and the fault type. Currently there are no specific standards published on monitoring and faults diagnosis of biodegradable oil filled transformers. The experiment results, fault identification and interpretation that have been found and proposed in this research {{can be used as a}} reference in order to know the insulation condition and to predict the faults that happen in this type of transformer...|$|E

Moisture distribution is highly dependent on temperature.
