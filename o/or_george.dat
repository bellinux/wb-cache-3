5|$|Kantakouzenos' second {{departure}} {{proved a}} great error. Back in the capital, his enemies moved in his absence. Apokaukos gathered {{a group of}} high-ranking aristocrats around him, including men such as the megas droungarios John Gabalas <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Choumnos, whom he tied to himself by marriage alliances. The Patriarch, backed by Apokaukos' group and {{the authority of the}} Empress, dismissed Kantakouzenos from his offices and declared him a public enemy. Kalekas himself was proclaimed regent and Apokaukos named Eparch of Constantinople. Kantakouzenos' relatives and supporters were imprisoned or forced to flee the city, and their properties confiscated. Although Kantakouzenos' wife and children were safe in his headquarters at Demotika (Didymoteicho), the regency placed his mother, Theodora, under house arrest. The privations she suffered during her imprisonment were to cause her eventual death.|$|E
5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington <b>or</b> <b>George</b> William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Persian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over. In thanks for {{the lifting of the}} siege and the supposed divine protection of the Virgin Mary, the celebrated Akathist Hymn was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius <b>or</b> <b>George</b> of Pisidia.|$|E

In 1821 he {{completed}} his independent creation of a Cherokee syllabary, making reading and writing in Cherokee possible. This {{was one of the}} very few times in recorded history that a member of a pre-literate people created an original, effective writing system (another example being Shong Lue Yang). After seeing its worth, the people of the Cherokee Nation rapidly began to use his syllabary and officially adopted it in 1825. Their literacy rate quickly surpassed that of surrounding European-American settlers.|$|E

25|$|With 1916, Aderca was {{focusing}} {{more closely}} {{on the social}} impact of war. A wide fresco of Romania's heavy losses to the Central Powers, and of the human drama they unfold, the book was praised by Lovinescu as an accurate portrayal of the 1914 to 1920 interval, and seen by Cubleșan as compatible with other Romanian depictions of World War I moral conflicts—in works by Camil Petrescu, Cezar Petrescu, Liviu Rebreanu <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Cornea. Aderca's novel, he notes, is an inverted take on the identity struggle depicted in Rebreanu's Forest of the Hanged, where an ethnic Romanian intellectual reevaluates his allegiance to Austria–Hungary. The plot is largely conventional in format, but Aderca turns to avant-garde techniques where he found they could enhance narrative authenticity: in one section, he mixes sheet music into the text.|$|E
25|$|Their {{influence}} certainly existed but it {{is difficult}} to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as Thomas Hardy in Jude the Obscure or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Eliot with Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss. There were also more conventional authors such as Matthew Arnold, who in a letter from 1853, says of Charlotte, that she only pretends to heartless: ' nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage'. In contrast, Mrs Humphry Ward, author of Robert Elsmere and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily. There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.|$|E

500|$|Most headstones are {{inscribed with}} a cross, {{except for those}} {{deceased}} known to be atheist or non-Christian. In the case of burials of Victoria Cross <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Cross recipients, the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Cross emblem. Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym {{because he was too}} young to serve or were sought by law enforcement; in such cases his primary name is shown along with the notation [...] "served as". [...] Many headstones are for unidentified casualties; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body. The epitaph, developed by Rudyard Kipling, that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is [...] "A Soldier of the Great War known unto God". Some headstones bear the text [...] "believed to be buried in this cemetery" [...] when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known. In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave. The headstone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date, and even then only if it is known, and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death.|$|E

You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, <b>or</b> <b>George</b> would give the same thing.

500|$|After a {{hiatus of}} one film—On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which George Lazenby played Bond—Connery {{returned}} to the role for Diamonds Are Forever after David Picker, the head of United Artists, {{made it clear that}} Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object. When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded—and received—a fee of £1.25 million (£ million in [...] pounds), 12.5% of the gross profits and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice. His performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery [...] "looks weary and bored... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character". Despite that, Benson considers that Connery [...] "still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Lazenby". On the other hand, Pauline Kael said [...] "Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish—and he's better this way".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} warrant {{stated that}} NCOs and private soldiers or seamen on the Victoria Cross Register {{were entitled to}} a £10 per annum annuity.

Today holders of the Victoria Cross <b>or</b> <b>George</b> Cross are entitled to an annuity, the amount of which {{is determined by the}} awarding government. Since 2015, the annuity paid by the British Government is £10,000 per year. This is exempted from tax for British taxpayers by Section 638 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, along with pensions or annuities from other awards for bravery. [...] In Canada under the Gallantry Awards Order, members of the Canadian Forces or people who joined the British forces before 31 March 1949 while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland receive Can$3,000 per year. Under Subsection 103.4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Australian Government provides a Victoria Cross Allowance. Until November 2005 the amount was A$3,230 per year.
