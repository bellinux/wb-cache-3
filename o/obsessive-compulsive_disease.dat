40|$|<b>Obsessive-Compulsive</b> <b>Disease</b> (OCD) {{incidence}} rate {{in children and}} adolescents is about 1 - 2 percent; males develop the disease more than females and it clearly is associated with attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and body dysmorphic disorder. Regarding the fact that initial diagnosis and treatment of disorders with OCD in children can protect them from further problems in their life, in this study, the premature OCD with motor tic disorder in an 8 -year-old boy is reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to examine family {{accommodation}} in relatives of <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disease</b> (OCD) patients. Accommodation was assessed {{in a sample}} of 31 relatives of OCD patients by means of the Family Accommodation Scale. Other variables measured as predictors of accommodation were the tendency of a family member to feel guilty, sensitivity to guilt, anxiety sensitivity and the prevalence of a passive communication style. Accommodation was found to be rather widespread in the family members who took part in our study, and they tended to show more accommodation the greater their sensitivity to guilt and the stable tendency to experience this emotion as well as anxiety sensitivity and a passive communication style. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that, among the variables considered, the family member’s sensitivity to guilt is the only factor which can predict accommodation with regard to the patient’s demands for involvement. On the other hand, the small number of family members in the sample and the lack of clinical data on patients (such as the severity, typology and duration of their obsessive-compulsive disorder) pose limits to the generalizability of the results and point to the need for further research...|$|E
40|$|The Nucleus accumbens (Nacc) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{to act as a}} limbic-motor interface. Here, using invasive intraoperative recordings in an awake patient suffering from <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disease</b> (OCD), we demonstrate that its activity is modulated by the quality of performance of the subject in a choice reaction time task designed to tap action monitoring processes. Action monitoring, that is, error detection and correction, is thought to be supported by a system involving the dopaminergic midbrain, the basal ganglia, and the medial prefrontal cortex. In surface electrophysiological recordings, action monitoring is indexed by an error-related negativity (ERN) appearing time-locked to the erroneous responses and emanating from the medial frontal cortex. In preoperative scalp recordings the patient's ERN was found to be signifi cantly increased compared to a large (n= 83) normal sample, suggesting enhanced action monitoring processes. Intraoperatively, error-related modulations were obtained from the Nacc but not from a site 5 mm above. Importantly, crosscorrelation analysis showed that error-related activity in the Nacc preceded surface activity by 40 ms. We propose that the Nacc is involved in action monitoring, possibly by using error signals from the dopaminergic midbrain to adjust the relative impact of limbic and prefrontal inputs on frontal control systems in order to optimize goal-directed behavior...|$|E

30|$|Striatum is a {{subcortical}} {{part of the}} forebrain. The striatal dysfunction {{can cause}} many neuropsychiatric disorders, for instance, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> disorder, and autism [96, 97]. Traditionally, the neuronal composition of the striatum has been defined by mostly medium spiny neurons (MSN) and a small population of interneurons [74]. MSNs have been classified anatomically and functionally into D 1 and D 2 MSNs [98] however, striatal diversity has not been assessed.|$|R
40|$|Implantation of {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) electrodes via stereotactic neurosurgery has become a standard procedure {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease. More recently, the range of neuropsychiatric conditions and the possible target structures suitable for DBS have greatly increased. The former include obsessive compulsive disease, depression, obesity, tremor, dystonia, Tourette’s syndrome and cluster-headache. In this article we argue that several of the target structures for DBS (nucleus accumbens, posterior inferior hypothalamus, nucleus subthalamicus, nuclei in the thalamus, globus pallidus internus, nucleus pedunculopontinus) are located at strategic positions with brain circuits related to motivational behaviors, learning, and motor regulation. Recording from DBS electrodes either during the operation or post-operatively from externalized leads while the patient is performing cognitive tasks tapping the functions of the respective circuits provides a new window on the brain mechanisms underlying these functions. This is exemplified by a study of a patient suffering from <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> <b>disease</b> from whom we recorded in a flanker task designed to tap action monitoring processes while he received a DBS electrode in the right nucleus accumbens. Clear error-related modulations were obtained from the target structure, demonstrating a role of the nucleus accumbens in action monitoring. Based on recent conceptualizations of several different functional loops and on neuroimaging results we suggest further lines of research using this new window on brain functions...|$|E

The Basal Ganglia {{comprise a}} group of forebrain nuclei that are interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem. Basal ganglia circuits are involved in various functions, including motor control and learning, sensorimotor integration, reward and cognition.

40|$|The neuropsychiatric {{manifestations of}} {{neurodegenerative}} diseases are {{closely linked to}} neurocircuitry defects. Frontal-subcortical circuits, in particular, are effector mechanisms that allow the organism to act on its environment In this paper, we present the three main frontal-subcortical circuits: the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit allows the organization of information to facilitate a response; the anterior cingulate circuit is required for motivated behavior; and the orbitofrontal circuit allows the integration of limbic and emotional information into behavioral responses. Impaired executive functions, apathy, and impulsivity are hallmarks of frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction. A variety of other neuropsychiatrie disorders, such as Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders may result from disturbances that have a direct or indirect impact on the integrity or functioning of these loops...|$|R
40|$|The {{striatum}} and its ventral extension {{the nucleus}} accumbens (NAcc) {{are the main}} inputs structure of the basal ganglia cir-cuit (Figure 1). While the striatum appears to be essential for the selection and initiation of actions and for the learning of habits and skills, the NAcc {{seems to be more}} involved in motivation and reward. Interestingly, dysfunctional plasticity of these structures has been associated with prominent neurological and psychi-atric disorders such as Parkinson’s <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, Tourette’s syndrome, and drug addiction. The aims of this Special Topic was to propose a series of reviews covering our recent understanding on striatal signaling pathways, which are activated by a variety of therapeutic agents or drugs of abuse in physiological and pathological context.

40|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} diseases worldwide. Although estimated that one third of the world's population are infected with Toxoplasma gondii, but the most common form of the disease is latent (asymptomatic). On the other hand, recent findings indicated that la-tent toxoplasmosis is not only unsafe for human, but also may play various roles in the etiology of different mental disorders. This paper reviews new findings about importance of latent toxop-lasmosis (except in immunocompromised patients) in alterations of behavioral parameters and also its role in the etiology of schizophrenia and depressive disorders, <b>obsessive–compulsive</b> disorder, Alzheimer's <b>diseases</b> and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, headache and or migraine, men-tal retardation and intelligence quotients, suicide attempt, risk of traffic accidents, sex ratio and some possible mechanisms of T. gondii that could contribute in the etiology of these alterations...|$|R
40|$|Wilson's disease, a {{disorder}} of copper metabolism, {{is known to}} be associated with psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatrists see about 20 % of these cases before they are labeled as Wilson's disease. Reports of these patients treated mistakenly as primary psychiatric illnesses exist in literature. This report thus emphasizes a thorough underpinning in this disease on the part of psychiatrists in order to arhve at the correct diagnosis at first contact. Besides this, the emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a case of Wilson's disease is described, which is a rare association. Finally, the authors discuss the role of basal ganglia in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Key words: Wilson's <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, basal ganglia Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited inborn error in copper metabolism and storage.

40|$|Abstract: Active site {{prediction}} of BDNF {{is done to}} identify the locations of ligand binding sites and to predict functional similarities between cavities to estimate the locations of bound ligands. BDNF {{is a member of}} the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical "Nerve Growth Factor", NGF. BDNF is a small dimeric protein which is abundantly and widely expressed in the adult mammalian brain. Various studies have shown possible links between BDNF and conditions, such as Diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, Alzheimer's <b>disease,</b> Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, and dementia, as well as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Active site of BDNF is obtained by using active site prediction server.

40|$|Like most neurotransmitters, {{serotonin}} {{possesses a}} simple structure. However, the pharmacological consequences {{are more complex}} and diverse. Serotonin is involved in numerous functions {{in the human body}} including the control of appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature regulation, mood, behavior, cardiovascular function, muscle contraction, endocrine regulation, and depression. Low levels of serotonin may be associated with several disorders, namely increase in aggressive and angry behaviors, clinical depression, Parkinson's <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, eating disorders, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, tinnitus, and bipolar disease. These effects are mediated via different serotonin (5 -HT) receptors. In this review, we will focus on the last discovered member of this serotonin receptor family, the 5 -HT 7 receptor. This receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and was cloned two decades ago. Later, different splice variants were described but no major functional differences have been described so far. All 5 -HT 7 receptor variants are coupled to G alpha(s) proteins and stimulate cAMP formation. Recently, several interacting proteins have been reported, which can influence receptor signaling and trafficking...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{functional}} imaging {{by means of}} Neuro SPECT has been progressively incorporated to the differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, cognitive impairment,, Alzheimer’s <b>Disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, attention deficit disorder, and brain effects of neurotoxic exposure. This review will be initiated evaluating the findings in brain hyperacute infarction before and post arterial thrombolisis treatment in order to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of this imaging modality in clinical work. On methodology, we have to comment, furthermore, that we perform double image reconstruction, one without attenuation correction for the lateral images, posterior and anterior images and the superior image of the brain cortex. A second reconstruction is performed with attentuation corection {{by means of a}} Chang coefficient of 0. 1, This is applied to the parasagital images and to the inferior image of the brain. In this last image, we remove the cerebellum in order to facilitate inspection of the inferior aspects of occipital and temporal lobes. We apply this modality also for the study of basal ganglia. The software that we have used is the Oasis Software of the Segami corporation of USA and brain imaging is performed by means of the Ecam Dual Head Siemens camera. We compare the clinical data with a normal, age matched database and display the results using a color scale defined by Standard Deviation below and above the normal mean for HMPAO Tc 99 m, while the normal range is depicted in color gray...|$|R
40|$|Background: Timing {{dysfunctions}} {{occur in}} a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, autism and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Several lines of evidence show that disrupted timing processing is involved in specific fronto-striatal abnormalities. The striatum encodes reinforcement learning and procedural motion, and consequently is required to represent temporal information precisely, which then guides actions in proper sequence. Previous studies highlighted the temporal scaling property of timing-relevant striatal neurons; however, it is still unknown how this is accomplished over short temporal latencies, such as the sub-seconds to seconds range. Methods: We designed a task with a series of timing behaviors that required rats to reproduce a fixed duration with robust action. Using chronic multichannel electrode arrays, we recorded neural activity from dorso-medial striatum in 4 rats performing the task and identified modulation response of each neuron to different events. Cell type classification was performed according to a multi-criteria clustering analysis. Results: Dorso-medial striatal neurons (n = 557) were recorded, of which 113 single units were considered as timing-relevant neurons, especially the fast-spiking subpopulation that had trial–to–trial ramping up or ramping down firing modulation during the time estimation period. Furthermore, these timing-relevant striatal neurons had to calibrate the spread of their firing pattern by rewarded experience to express the timing behavior accurately. Conclusion: Our data suggests that the dynamic activities of timing-relevant units encode information about the current duration and recent outcomes, which is needed to predict and drive the following action. These results reveal the potential mechanism of time calibration in a short temporal resolution, which may help to explain the neural basis of motor coordination affected by certain physiological or pathological conditions...|$|R
40|$|The dorsal {{striatum}} is {{the main}} input structure of the basal ganglia and the major target area of dopaminergic projections originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Heavily involved in the regulation of voluntary movement and habit formation, this structure is of strong importance in Parkinson’s <b>disease,</b> <b>obsessive-compulsive</b> disorder, Tourette’s syndrome and addiction. The C 57 /Bl 6 J mouse strain, {{the most commonly used}} strain in preclinical research today, is frequently used as a model organism for analysis of dopaminergic parameters implicated in human pathophysiology. Several components of the dopamine system have been shown to vary with age and sex, however knowledge of the contribution of these factors for dopamine release kinetics in the C 57 /Bl 6 J mouse strain is lacking. In the present study, we used an intracranial KCl-stimulation challenge paradigm to provoke release from dopaminergic terminals in the dorsal striatum of anaesthetized C 57 /Bl 6 J mice. By high-speed in vivo chronoamperometric recordings, we analyzed DA release parameters in male and female mice of two different ages. Our experiments demonstrate elevated DA amplitudes in adult compared to young mice of both sexes and higher DA amplitudes in females compared to males at both ages. Adult mice exhibited higher recovery capabilities after repeated stimulation than did young mice and also showed a lower variability in the kinetic parameters trise and t 80 between stimulations. These results identified age- and sex- dimorphisms in DA release parameters and point to the importance of taking these dimorphisms into account when utilizing the C 57 /Bl 6 J mouse strain as model for neurologica...|$|R
