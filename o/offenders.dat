40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} use of <b>offender</b> profiling evidence in criminal cases. The meaning, history, approaches and legal admissibility of <b>offender</b> profiling have been discussed. The introduction of <b>offender</b> profiling into the courtroom has been controversial, problematic and full of inconsistencies. This dissertation therefore, examined the central problems with <b>offender</b> profiling evidence, and answered such questions as - Is <b>offender</b> profiling impermissible character evidence? Who is qualified to give expert profiling evidence? Is <b>offender</b> profiling too prejudicial than probative? Is <b>offender</b> profiling an opinion on the ultimate issue? Is <b>offender</b> profiling sufficiently reliable as to be admissible? This dissertation has noted that in United States, there are inconsistencies in the court decisions on <b>offender</b> profiling evidence {{as a result of}} the three conflicting rules governing the admissibility of expert evidence. After a critical examination of the three rules, the adoption of one rule has been suggested. The Frye test standard combined with the Federal Rules of Evidence 702 provides the best admissibility standard. Many people are confused as to the appropriate discipline of <b>offender</b> profiling. This dissertation has therefore, presented a step by step analysis of the history and development of <b>offender</b> profiling. <b>Offender</b> profiling is a multi-disciplinary practice that cuts across many disciplines. At the moment, it is best described as an art with the potential of becoming a science. This dissertation concludes that <b>offender</b> profiling is not sufficiently reliable as to be admissible. It is too prejudicial than probative. This dissertation also concludes that there is an uneasy relationship, lack of unity and absence of sharing information amongst the different segments involved with <b>offender</b> profiling, and that this problem has limited the potential of <b>offender</b> profiling. Hence, some courts are not convinced as to the reliability and validity of this technique. Several recommendations have been made...|$|R

5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent <b>offenders</b> similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those <b>offenders</b> had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political <b>offenders,</b> Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political <b>offenders</b> who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{bullying}} in a nursing workplace, we test the argument that an <b>offender‘s</b> perspective-taking promotes victim conciliation, mediated by perceived perspective-taking, that is, {{the extent to which}} the victim perceives the <b>offender</b> as taking their perspective. Perceived perspective-taking facilitates the attribution of moral emotions (remorse, etc.) to the <b>offender,</b> thereby promoting conciliatory victim responses. However, perceived perspective-taking would be qualified by {{the extent to which the}} severity of consequences expressed in the <b>offender‘s</b> perspective-taking matches or surpasses the severity for the victim. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 141 and 122), victims indicated greater trust and/or forgiveness when the <b>offender</b> had taken the victim‘s perspective. This was sequentially mediated by perceived perspective-taking and victim‘s inference that the <b>offender</b> had felt moral emotions. As predicted, in Study 2 (but not Study 1) severity of consequences qualified victims‘ perceived perspective-taking. Study 3 (N = 138) examined three potential mechanisms for the moderation by severity. Victims attributed greater perspective-taking to the <b>offender</b> when the consequences were less severe than voiced by the <b>offender,</b> suggesting victims‘ appreciation of the <b>offender‘s</b> generous appraisal. Attributions of perspective-taking and of moral emotions to the <b>offender</b> may play an important role in reconciliation processes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{underlying}} assumptions of <b>Offender</b> Profiling {{and the ability}} to infer <b>offender</b> characteristics from crime scene characteristics of sexual offences, taking into consideration the potential mediating effects of the contextual factors surrounding the offence, the <b>offender’s</b> implicit theories, and their motivations to sexually offend. The data examined, collected during the evaluation of the Sex <b>Offender</b> Treatment Programme, consisted of men who committed either a rape or sexual murder against adult women. The <b>Offender</b> Profiling literature is reviewed and critiqued in Chapter 1, identifying future areas to examine in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 compares the characteristics of rapists and sexual murderers and the pathway to offending of sexual aggressors of adult women. Chapter 5 looked at the effects of various contextual variables on the relationship between <b>offender</b> characteristics and offence characteristics. Chapter 6 investigates the inclusion of perceptual aspects {{in the form of the}} <b>offender’s</b> implicit theories and the effect these have on the A to C equation. Chapter 7 examines the effect of the <b>offender’s</b> motivations to offend, and how these would affect the ability to infer <b>offender</b> characteristics from crime scene variables.
