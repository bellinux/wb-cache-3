Abstract—There is substantial interest controlling a group of bodies from specifications of tasks given in a high-level, humanlike language. This paper proposes a methodology that creates low-level hybrid controllers that guarantee {{that a group of}} bodies execute a high-level specified task without dynamical system modeling, precise state estimation or state feedback. We do this by exploiting the wild motions of very simple bodies in an environment connected by gates which serve as the system inputs, as opposed motors on the bodies. We present experiments using inexpensive hardware demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach to solving tasks such as navigation, patrolling, and coverage. I...|$|E
40|$|Several {{well-known}} analytical techniques {{exist for}} the force profile analysis of permanent-magnet linear oscillating motors (PMLOMs). These techniques, however, make significant simplifications {{in order to obtain}} the magnetic field distribution in the air gap. From the field distribution, the force profile can be found. These widelyused techniques provide a reasonable approximation for force profile analysis, but fail to give really accurate results {{in the sense of the}} exact shape of the force profile caused by effects that due to simplification are not fully included. To obtain the exact shape for the force profile in these cases, the computationally expensive finite-element method (FEM) is often applied. In this from the resulting field distribution, the force profile is calculated by means of the Maxwell stress tensor. The objective of this paper is to determine the forces for aluminium mover embedded with Nd-Fe-B Rare Earth Permanent Magnet experimentally and analytically through FEMLAB 6. 2 WITH MATHWORKS software and develop microcontroller based IGBT Inverter for its control.

40|$|A {{conventional}} {{reciprocating compressor}} uses a crank mechanism {{in order to}} change the rotational motion of a motor into linear motion. Accordingly, a reciprocating compressor can be operated safely {{by virtue of the}} crank mechanism, even though it makes the reciprocating compressor less efficient. However, the moving parts of a linear compressor are not constrained. Thus, the implementation of a closed-loop control system is necessary for the accurate control of piston position. In this paper, a closed-loop sensorless stroke control system for an <b>oscillating</b> linear <b>motor</b> has been designed. The motor parameters are identified {{as a function of the}} piston position and the motor current. They are stored in ROM table and used later for the accurate estimation of piston position. Some experimental results are given in order to show the feasibility of the proposed control schemes for linear compressors.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of servomechanisms in which power is transmitted from the motor to payload using a flat steel belt. The bandwidth of control in such systems is usually limited by a resonance in which the payload and <b>motor</b> <b>oscillate</b> out of phase and the belt undergoes longitudinal strains.

40|$|Spontaneous {{directed}} motion, {{a hallmark}} of cell biology, is unusual in classical statistical physics. Here we study, using both numerical and analytical methods, organized motion in models of the cytoskeleton in which constituents are driven by energy-consuming motors. Although systems driven by small-step motors are described by an effective temperature and are thus quiescent, at higher order in step size, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, flowing and <b>oscillating</b> behavior emerges. <b>Motors</b> that respond with a negative susceptibility to imposed forces lead to an apparent negative-temperature system in which beautiful structures form resembling the asters seen in cell division...|$|R
50|$|To {{simulate}} the rhythmic shortening and lengthening of a muscle (e.g. while moving a limb), a servo <b>motor</b> <b>oscillates</b> the muscle {{at a given}} frequency and range of motion observed in natural behavior. Simultaneously, a burst of electrical pulses {{is applied to the}} muscle {{at the beginning of each}} shortening-lengthening cycle to stimulate the muscle to produce force. Since force and length return to their initial values at the end of each cycle, a plot of force vs. length yields a 'work loop'. Intuitively, the area enclosed by the loop represents the net mechanical work performed by the muscle during a single cycle.|$|R
40|$|Dynamics in {{locomotion}} {{is highly}} useful, {{as can be}} seen in animals and is becomingapparent in robots. For instance, chimpanzees are dynamic climbers that canreach virtually any part of a tree and even move to neighboring trees, while sloths arequasistatic climbers confined only to a few branches. Although dynamic maneuversare undoubtedly beneficial, only a few engineered systems use them, most of whichlocomote horizontally. This is because the design and control are often extremelycomplicated. This thesis explores a family of dynamic climbing robots which extend roboticdynamic legged locomotion from horizontal motions such as walking, hopping, andrunning, to vertical motions such as leaping maneuvers. The motion of these dynamicrobots resembles the motion of an athlete jumping and climbing inside achute. Whereas this environment might be an unnavigable obstacle for a slow, quasistaticclimber, it is an invaluable source of reaction forces for a dynamic climber. The mechanisms described here achieve dynamic, vertical motions while retainingsimplicity in design and control. The first mechanism called DSAC, for Dynamic Single Actuated Climber, comprisesonly two links connected by a single oscillating actuator. This simple, openlooposcillation, propels the robot stably between two vertical walls. By rotating theaxis of revolution of the single actuator by 90 degrees, we also developed a simplerrobot that can be easily miniaturized and can be used to climb inside tubes. The DTAR, for Dynamic Tube Ascending Robot, uses a single continuously rotatingmotor, unlike the <b>oscillating</b> DSAC <b>motor.</b> This continuous rotation even furthersimplifies and enables the miniaturization of the robot to enable robust climbinginside small tubes. The last mechanism explored in this thesis is the ParkourBot,which sacrifices some of the simplicity shown in the first two mechanism in favorof efficiency and more versatile climbing. This mechanism comprises two efficientspringy legs connected to a body. We use this family of dynamic climbers to explore a minimalist approach to locomotion. We first analyze the open-loop stability characteristics of all three mechanisms. We show how an open-loop, sensorless control, such as the fixed oscillationof the DSAC’s leg can converge to a stable orbit. We also show that a change inthe mechanism’s parameters not only changes the stability of the system but alsochanges the climbing pattern from a symmetric climb to a limping, non-symmetricclimb. Corresponding analyses are presented for the DTAR and ParkourBot mechanisms. We finally show how the open-loop behavior can be used to traverse morecomplex terrains by incrementally adding feedback. We are able to achieve climbinginside a chute with wall width changes without the need for precise and fast sensingand control...|$|R
