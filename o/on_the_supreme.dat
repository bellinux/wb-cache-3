5|$|In 1876, he {{returned}} to the Oregon Supreme Court after winning the election. Two years later, the Oregon Legislative Assembly divided the court into the Supreme Court and the Oregon Circuit Court, and reduced the number of justices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court to three. With the new court, all prior judges lost their seats and the three positions were filled by appointment of the governor. Boise was appointed by Governor W. W.

5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Sotomayor to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 {{by a vote of}} 68–31. Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left {{with the death of}} John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
