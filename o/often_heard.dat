5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Byard was {{the subject}} of a short {{documentary}} film, Anything for Jazz, which featured him playing, teaching and with his family. By the 1980s his main instrument remained the piano, and he still played both alto and tenor saxophones, but he had stopped playing the other instruments that he used to use professionally – bass, drums, guitar, trombone, and trumpet, although he still taught all of them. In the same period, he was <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he played with a band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band. Byard played and recorded with a former student of his, Ricky Ford, from 1989 to 1991, and continued to play and teach during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, {{because of}} Ruisdael's {{depiction}} of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael {{was buried in the}} Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world {{was about to be}} born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|By 1345 the Lord Chancellor {{began to}} be seen {{as the leader of the}} Court of Chancery, rather than as a {{representative}} of the King, and writs and bills were addressed directly to him. Under Richard II it became practice to consider the Chancery separate from the curia; academic William Carne considers this a key moment in confirming the independence of the Court of Chancery. The Chancellor and his clerks <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> the cases directly, rather than having them referred to the council itself; occasionally a committee of lay and church members disposed of them, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. John Baker argues that it was the late 14th century that saw Chancery procedure become fixed, citing the work done by John Waltham as Master of the Rolls between 1381 and 1386, and notes that this period also saw the first complaints about the Chancery.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E
60|$|His {{reason and}} his propensities had seldom any {{reciprocating}} influence, having separated {{by mutual consent}} long ago: thence it sometimes happened that, while his intentions were as honourable as could be wished, any particular deed formed a dark background which threw them into fine relief. The sergeant's vicious phases being the offspring of impulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter had a modest tendency to be <b>oftener</b> <b>heard</b> of than seen.|$|R
60|$|He {{called to}} Omskirk {{to bring a}} bottle of a {{particularly}} exquisite Italian wine, known only to the most deeply skilled in the vintages of that country, and which, he said, was <b>oftener</b> <b>heard</b> of than seen,-- oftener seen than tasted. Omskirk {{put it on the}} table in its original glass, and Braithwaite filled Redclyffe's glass and his own, and raised the latter to his lips, with a frank expression of his mobile countenance.|$|R

5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|Edgar Leslie Bainton (14 February 18808 December 1956) was a British-born, latterly Australian-resident composer. He {{is remembered}} today mainly for his liturgical anthem And I saw a new heaven, a popular {{work in the}} {{repertoire}} of Anglican church music, but during recent years Bainton's other musical works, neglected for decades, have been increasingly <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> on CD.|$|E

25|$|The {{pairwise}} exchange or 2-opt technique involves iteratively removing two {{edges and}} replacing these with two different edges that reconnect the fragments created by edge removal {{into a new}} and shorter tour. This is a special case of the k-opt method. Note that the label Lin–Kernighan is an <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> misnomer for 2-opt. Lin–Kernighan is actually the more general k-opt method.|$|E
25|$|Marbled polecats mate from March {{to early}} June. Their mating calls are most <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> as low {{rumbling}} sounds {{in a slow}} rhythm. Gestation can be long and variable (243days to 327days). Parturition has been observed to occur from late January to mid-March. Delayed implantation allows marbled polecats to time {{the birth of their}} cubs for favorable conditions, such as when prey is abundant.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous {{are rarely}} seen but <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> within their range {{and have a}} wide variety of calls. They are among the most {{characteristic}} bird vocalizations of South America and Central America, often resembling sounds made by a flute or a whistle. Some calls are uniform and monotone, while others have multiple phrases. They vary in intensity and can often be heard from afar. Trying to locate a bird by its call is not easy.|$|E

25|$|A handbell is a bell {{designed}} to be rung by hand. To ring a handbell, a ringer grasps the bell by its slightly flexible handle - traditionally made of leather, but often now made of plastic – and moves the wrist to make the hinged clapper inside the bell strike. An individual handbell can be used simply as a signal to catch people's attention or summon them together, but handbells are also <b>often</b> <b>heard</b> in tuned sets.|$|E
