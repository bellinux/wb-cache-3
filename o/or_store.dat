Examples include: Eye-Fi / SanDisk, Transcend Wi-Fi, Toshiba FlashAir, Trek Flucard, PQI Air Card and LZeal ez Share. Some models geotag their pictures.|$|E
25|$|Later, it {{was noted}} {{that one of the most}} {{significant}} characteristics of RISC processors was that external memory was only accessible by a load <b>or</b> <b>store</b> instruction. All other instructions were limited to internal registers. This simplified many aspects of processor design: allowing instructions to be fixed-length, simplifying pipelines, and isolating the logic for dealing with the delay in completing a memory access (cache miss, etc.) to only two instructions. This led to RISC designs being referred to as load/store architectures.|$|E

25|$|Top-down approach: This is {{the direct}} {{fall-out}} of the recursive formulation of any problem. If {{the solution to}} any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize <b>or</b> <b>store</b> the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table {{to see if it}} is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.|$|E
25|$|A 1960 {{accord with}} Japan permits the United States to move {{weapons of mass}} {{destruction}} through Japanese territory and allows American warships and submarines to carry nuclear weapons into Japan's ports and American aircraft to bring them in during landings. The agreement allows the United States to deploy <b>or</b> <b>store</b> nuclear arms in Japan without requiring the express permission of the Japanese Government. The discussion took place during negotiations in 1959, and the agreement was made in 1960 by Aiichiro Fujiyama, then Japan's Foreign Minister.|$|E
25|$|A lever is a beam {{connected}} to ground by a hinge, or pivot, called a fulcrum. The ideal lever does not dissipate <b>or</b> <b>store</b> energy, which {{means there is}} no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam. In this case, the power into the lever equals the power out, and the ratio of output to input force is given by {{the ratio of the}} distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces. This is known as the law of the lever.|$|E

25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, {{and credit card}} numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it <b>or</b> <b>store</b> it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
25|$|The U-2's {{retirement}} {{was calculated}} to save $2.2 billion. $1.77 billion {{will have to}} be spent over 10 years to enhance the RQ-4, including $500 million on a universal payload adapter to attach U-2 sensors onto the RQ-4. USAF officials fear that retiring the U-2 amid RQ-4 upgrades will create a capability gap; other high-altitude ISR platforms would be used to substitute including satellites and the secretive RQ-170 and RQ-180 UAVs. In the House Armed Services Committee's markup of the FY 2015 budget, language was included prohibiting the use of funds to retire <b>or</b> <b>store</b> the U-2; it also requested a report outlining the transition capabilities from the U-2 to the RQ-4 Block 30 in light of capability gap concerns.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{potential}} for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” <b>or</b> <b>store.</b> One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E
25|$|Yasuda joined Toei Doga in April 1958, {{immediately}} after her graduation from high school. Yasuda {{has said that}} she applied not knowing what the job entailed but that she had submitted her application {{because she did not}} fancy employment in any of the other jobs available for most women at the time, such as bank teller <b>or</b> <b>store</b> clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned up line drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Despite police {{knowledge}} that Haarmann {{was both a}} known criminal and a known homosexual (then illegal and punishable by imprisonment in Germany), Haarmann gradually began to establish a relationship with Hanover police as an informer, largely {{as a means of}} redirecting the attention of the police from himself in his own criminal activities, and to facilitate his access to young males. By 1919, he is known to have regularly patrolled Hanover station, and to have provided police with information relating to Hanover's extensive criminal network. With the cooperation of several police officials, Haarmann devised a ruse whereby he would offer to fence <b>or</b> <b>store</b> stolen property at his premises, then pass this information to police, who would then raid his property at agreed times and arrest these contacts. To remove any suspicion as to his treachery reaching the criminal fraternity, Haarmann himself would be arrested in these raids. Moreover, on numerous occasions, he is known to have performed citizen's arrests upon commuters for offenses such as travelling on forged documents. As a result of these activities, police began to rely on Haarmann as a reliable source of information regarding various criminal activities in the city, and he was allowed to patrol Hanover station largely at will.|$|E
