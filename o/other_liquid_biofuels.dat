40|$|The LignoJet project {{aimed to}} achieve an {{intermediate}} lignin-oil product miscible with fossil feedstock and with a significantly reduced oxygen content. A technical concept for production has been studied that involves combined catalysed depolymerisation and hydrodeoxygenation, so called hydrogenolytic depolymerisation, of kraft lignin. Kraft lignin was separated through membrane ultrafiltration from softwood and eucalyptus black liquor followed by precipitation through LignoBoost technology. A difference in lignin properties was observed between ultrafiltration of softwood and eucalyptus black liquor through 15 and 150 kDa ceramic membranes. Lignin-oils with similar oxygen content were produced regardless of origin and fractionation technique. A lignin-oil with favourable properties as precursor for refinery integration for jet fuel production as produced in small-scale batch experiments using nickel-based catalyst. Stable pumpable oils with melting point of less than 25 - 50 deg C and with 20 - 30 % lower oxygen content and aromatic content were obtained that would be suitable as jet fuel precursors. The estimated production cost {{was found to be}} competitive with that of <b>other</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels,</b> while additional revenues could potentially be achieved by also producing chemical and materials from suitable fractions of the lignin-oil...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to available country or site-specific life cycle studies on Jatropha biodiesel {{we present a}} generic, location-independent life cycle assessment and provide a general but in-depth analysis of the environmental performance of Jatropha biodiesel for transportation. Additionally, we assess the influence of changes in byproduct use and production chain. In our assessments, we went beyond the impact on energy requirement and global warming by including impacts on ozone layer and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication. The basic Jatropha biodiesel system consumes eight times less nonrenewable energy than conventional diesel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 51 %. This result coincides with the lower limit {{of the range of}} reduction percentages available in literature for this system and for <b>other</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels.</b> The impact on the ozone layer is also lower than that provoked by fossil diesel, although eutrophication and acidification increase eight times. This study investigates the general impact trends of the Jatropha system, although not considering land-use change. The results are useful as a benchmark against which other biodiesel systems can be evaluated, to calculate repayment times for land-use change induced carbon loss or as guideline with default values for assessing the environmental performance of specific variants of the system.

40|$|Microbial enzymes {{are capable}} of {{degrading}} {{a wide range of}} complex substrates including carbohydrates into more useful energy source. The simple sugars then can be converted into ethanol or <b>other</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> by a large group of fermentative microbes. Even though cellulose serves as an abundant source of carbon and energy in the ecosystem, its exploitation as a source of biofuel is hindered due to lack of effective microbial systems to break it down, including other carbohydrates to simple sugars leading to more production of biofuels. If these materials could be exploited, they would represent a massive new energy resource for biofuel production. In continuous search for alternative energy sources, it is now proven that electricity can be produced directly from the degradation of organic matter in a microbial fuel cell and fermentationÂ of lignocellulosic biomass toÂ ethanol, which is an attractive route to fuels that supplements theÂ fossil fuels. Â Studies have revealed that special group enzymes known as feruloyl esterases produced by microorganisms {{are capable of}} breaking apart key links between the polymers and helps in effective degradation of plant materials. Â This review covers various known microbial approaches to convert different carbon sources to simple soluble sugars en route to production of biofuels. The importance of the biofuel in future is highlighted by the Renewable Fuel Standard of the United States Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, which mandates that 36 billion gallons of biofuels are to be produced annually by 2022, of which 16 billion gallons are expected to come from cellulosic feed stocks. It is obvious fact that microorganisms and its array of enzymes need to be effectively screened, identified and employed in developing effective strategies for converting biomass to biofuel...|$|E

Comparisons of fossil fuels and <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> regarding their life cycle emissions of pollutants which are (eco) toxic or contribute to oxidizing smog, acidification or nutrification give mixed results. Fossil fuels often do better than biofuels as to emissions of acidifying and nutrifying substances, but often worse regarding ecotoxicity.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> from {{agricultural}} {{raw materials}} (mainly cereals and oilseeds) are produced in Poland on an industrial scale since 2005. Poland, implementing guidelines for the energy policy of the European Union, is committed to ensure the share of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> in the total fuel consumption in transport in at least 10 % by 2020. The development of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> market is therefore dependent {{on the one hand}} on institutional factors (legal and administrative regulations), and on the other hand, primarily on the situation of {{agricultural raw materials}} markets (supply-demand relationships and prices) and macroeconomic factors, mainly crude oil prices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a heuristic methodology for estimating the possible {{variation of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> potential of a region, an appraisal made for a future period of time. The determination of the <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> potential has been made up either on the account of an average (constant) yield of the energetic crops that were used, or on the account of a yield that varies depending on a known trend, which can be estimated through a certain method. The proposed methodology uses the variation of the yield of energetic crops over {{time in order to}} simulate a variation of the biofuel potential for a future ten year time period. This new approach to the problem of determining the <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> potential of a certain land area can be useful for investors, as it allows making a more realistic analysis of the investment risk and of the possibilities of recovering the investment. On the other hand, the presented methodology can be useful to the governmental administration in order to elaborate strategies and policies to ensure the necessity of fuels and <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> for transportation, in a certain area. Unlike current methods, which approach the problem of determining the <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuel</b> potential in a deterministic way, by using econometric methods, the proposed methodology uses heuristic reasoning schemes {{in order to reduce the}} great number of factors that actually influence the biofuel potential and which usually have unknown values...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the macro-environmental dimensions under which journalists, scientists and policy-makers have framed the <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> in the US over time. The number of publications concerning <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> from mass media, scientific community and government with ethanol production are correlated, seeking for causality between ethanol production and those stakeholders' agendas. Text-mining techniques were used to explore 2016 mass-media news sources, 455 scientific papers and 854 government documents published between 1997 and 2006. Granger-causality tests were performed to analyse the causality concerning stakeholders' agendas. The results indicate that scientists emphasise environmental, agronomic and technological matters, while journalists {{are more interested in}} covering economic, environmental, geopolitical and political issues. Although policies on this subject appear to be more in line with science, the trend analysis indicates that the mass media are gaining prominence amongst policy-makers. The causation analysis suggests that ethanol production and public policy present a bi-directional causality at t- 2 time lag. At t- 1 time lag, ethanol production precedes the publication of scientific documents, which present a bi-directional causality with public policy on ethanol and precedes the mass-media news. In conclusion, ethanol production precedes the presence of <b>liquid</b> <b>biofuels</b> on the agendas of scientists, journalists and policy-makers...|$|R
