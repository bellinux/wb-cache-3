5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the <b>ordinary</b> <b>court,</b> Pain also heard cases {{relating}} to the forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution also {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} some of Robert's work. Robert had designed the decorations for a little theatre in the new wing at the location of the current staircase Gabriel in the Palace of Versailles. Designed to seat about 500, this theatre was built from the summer of 1785 and opened in early 1786. It was intended to serve as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>court</b> theatre, replacing the Theatre of the Princes Court which was too old and too small, but was destroyed during the time of Louis Philippe. A watercolour of Robert's design is in the National Archives in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trial of}} the ringleaders of the {{rebellion}} (the 19 surviving officers, Isobe, Muranaka and two other civilians) began on April 28. The trial was held in secret, and the defendants did not have rights to legal representation, call witnesses or appeal. The judges {{were not interested in}} hearing about the defendants' motives and intentions and forced them to concentrate on their actions in their testimony. The trial was therefore far different from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>court</b> martial that Aizawa had faced a few months earlier. Charged with , the rebel officers argued that their actions had been approved by the Minister of War's Proclamation and their incorporation into the martial law forces, and that they had never been formally presented with the imperial command. The verdicts were handed down on June 4 and the sentences on July 5: all were found guilty and 17 were sentenced to death.|$|E
500|$|In one period, {{particularly}} under Edward III, the Lord Chancellor also possessed {{some common}} law jurisdiction, {{able to hear}} cases for petitions of right and the repeal of letters patent, {{as well as other}} cases in which the King was a party. He heard cases on recognizances, the execution of Acts of Parliament and any case in which an officer of the Court of Chancery was involved. Records show that he enrolled recognizances and contracts, and also issued writs commanding a sheriff to enforce them. Carne considers that this common law jurisdiction was likely down to a failure to separate the common law jurisdiction and the equity jurisdiction possessed by the Lord Chancellor, a failure that continued into the 16th century; Sir Edward Coke wrote that in the Chancery there was both an <b>ordinary</b> <b>court</b> and an [...] "extraordinary" [...] one.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} how basic court principles {{is emphasized}} in the land consolidation <b>court</b> compared to <b>ordinary</b> <b>courts.</b> The comparison {{is based on the}} fact that the land consolidation court has a different history and other traditions, as well as several self representative parties. The main research question is: How are basic court principles {{emphasized in the}} land consolidation <b>court</b> compared to <b>ordinary</b> <b>courts?</b> The problem is manifested in three sub-questions: 1) Can the court provide evidence, and do they in practice? 2) To what extent can the court emphasize the part of a document proof the party have not verbally mentioned at the main hearing? 3) Does the Land Consolidation <b>Court</b> and <b>ordinary</b> <b>courts</b> add more or less emphasis on different types of evidence? To answer these issues I've talked to land consolidation judges, district court judges, court of appeal judges and lawyers with practices from both land consolidation <b>court</b> and <b>ordinary</b> <b>courts</b> about their viewpoints and experiences. It's the assessments that underlie the enforcement of court principles that are of interest in this context, but it has also been necessary to clarify the procedural framework...|$|R

[...] Shiites are disqualified as witnesses in court, as Saudi Sunni sources cite the Shi'a practise of 'Taqiyya'- wherein it is permissible to lie while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution. Shia cannot serve as judges in <b>ordinary</b> <b>court,</b> and are banned from gaining admission to military academies, and from high-ranking government or security posts, including becoming pilots in Saudi Airlines.|$|E

The JEP would have jurisdiction over non-coercive financing of or collaboration with paramilitary groups for persons who had a 'determinant participation in the most serious and representative crimes'. However, members of paramilitary groups who demobilized and appeared before an <b>ordinary</b> <b>court</b> or the justice and peace tribunals would not be the competence of the JEP, although the government would commit to adopt measures to strengthen the clarification of the paramilitary phenomenon. Colombian Presidents, who benefit from a special constitutional status (article 174), would not be subject to the JEP.

60|$|It was court day as I rode {{into the}} little town of Jonesboro, the air {{sparkling}} like a blue diamond over the mountain crests, and I drew deep into my lungs once more the scent of the frontier life I had loved so well. In the streets currents of excited men flowed and backed and eddied, backwoodsmen and farmers in the familiar hunting shirts of hide or homespun, and lawyers in dress less rude. A line of horses stood kicking and switching their tails in front of the log tavern, rough carts and wagons had been left here and there with their poles on the ground, and between these, piles of skins were heaped up and bags of corn and grain. The log meeting-house was deserted, but the court-house was the centre of such a swirling crowd as I had often seen at Harrodstown. Now there are brawls and brawls, and I should have thought with shame of my Kentucky bringing-up had I not perceived that this was no <b>ordinary</b> <b>court</b> day, and that an unusual excitement was in the wind.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{question}} of importance that {{came before the}} Commission was the mode of trial to be adopted {{in the cases of}} those persons accused of acts contrary to the usages of civilised warfare, such as murder. The Attorney-General for the Transvaal strongly advised that a special Tribunal should be constituted to try these cases, principally because [...] "after a civil war in which all the inhabitants of a country, with very few exceptions, have taken part, a jury of fair and impartial men, truly unbiassed, will be very difficult to get together." [...] It is satisfactory to know that the Commissioners gave this somewhat obvious fact [...] "their grave consideration," [...] which, according to their Report, resulted in their determining to let the cases go before the <b>ordinary</b> <b>court,</b> and be tried by a jury, because in referring them to a specially constituted court which would have done equal justice without fear or favour, [...] "the British Government would have made for itself, among the Dutch population of South Africa, a name for vindictive oppression, which no generosity in other affairs could efface." ...|$|E
