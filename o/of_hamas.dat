5|$|The ancient {{bas-relief}} inscriptions of Jewish {{religious symbols}} were allegedly chiseled away intentionally at some stage between 1987 and 1993. During the Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations <b>of</b> <b>Hamas</b> and Fatah, the mosque's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati {{was shot dead}} by Fatah gunmen on June 12, 2007, {{in retaliation for the}} killing of an official of Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day. The mosque is still active and serves as an emotional and physical support base for Gaza's residents and a focal point of Palestinian pride.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth <b>of</b> <b>Hamas</b> and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2006, Henry Siegman, former {{director}} of the American Jewish Committee, stated that according to [...] "a prominent senior member <b>of</b> <b>Hamas's</b> Political Committee" [...] Hamas is prepared to explicitly recognize the state of Israel. [...] "Members <b>of</b> <b>Hamas's</b> political directorate do not preclude significant changes over time in their policies toward Israel and in their founding charter, including recognition of Israel, and even mutual minor border adjustments. Such changes depend on Israel's recognition of Palestinian rights. Hamas will settle for nothing less than full reciprocity." [...] These sentiments [...] "are in striking contrast to the odiousness <b>of</b> <b>Hamas's</b> founding charter," [...] said Siegman.|$|R

50|$|Hamas, {{together}} with several charities it runs, {{has been designated}} by several governments and some academics as a terrorist organization. Others regard Hamas as a complex organization with terrorism as only one component. Israel outlawed Hamas in September 1989 The United States followed suit in 1995, as did Canada in November 2002. The European Union outlawed Hamas's military wing in 2001 and included Hamas in its list of terrorist organizations in 2003, which Hamas successfully challenged in the courts, and continued to do so under American and Israeli pressure. The basis <b>of</b> <b>Hamas's</b> challenge to the EU classification in 2007 {{was that it was}} drawn up on the basis of media reports, rather than grounded in any analysis <b>of</b> <b>Hamas's</b> history. In July 2017, the European Court of Justice overruled this challenge, citing that the evidence of media reports was only used for keeping Hamas on the list, rather than to add it to the list in the first place.|$|R
