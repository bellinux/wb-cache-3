The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of}} time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
40|$|While {{contemporary}} {{research in}} the field of transportation is paying due attention to the geography and composition <b>of</b> personal <b>social</b> networks, little do we still know about the quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Individuals’ quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> life can be dictated by the subjective quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> particularly crucial for the elderly, the disadvantaged and the migrated population. Review of literature depicts that social belongingness and geographical integration contribute to an individual’s quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> life and that the number <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> do not necessarily represent the quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> life. It is, therefore, important to gain insight in the subjective aspects <b>of</b> <b>social</b> activities in addition to the objective aspects. To that end, this study summarizes empirical evidence of factors that influence the importance <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> is measured by the individual’s subjective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> The subjective value added to each <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> would reflect on the individual’s social well-being, the authors argue. Further to represent geographical integration an index <b>of</b> perceived <b>social</b> cohesion has been incorporated into the estimation. Results suggest that neighborhood and mobility characteristics are important in explaining the quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Frequency <b>of</b> important <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> is positively associated with frequency of walking or cycling. The frequency <b>of</b> important <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> was also found to be higher for people living in neighborhoods with higher levels <b>of</b> perceived <b>social</b> cohesion and walkability, and lower for people living in rural areas, in neighborhoods with higher percentages of older residents and in neighborhoods with higher percentages of ethnic minorities...|$|R

5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> earned him many critics.|$|E
5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} a high level <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> between birds, {{which has led to}} a large {{repertoire}} of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 18th century, {{the society}} of the kingdom {{followed}} age-old and deeply established norms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu caste system and of animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called Mahanavami). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction,</b> expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours.

However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{there has}} been limited {{empirical}} scrutiny of the correlates and consequences of day-to-day state body dissatisfaction fluctuations within naturalistic contexts. We used ecological momentary assessment (a form of naturalistic observation) to evaluate whether state body dissatisfaction was concurrently and/or prospectively associated with occurrence and quality <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Women (N = 121), aged 18 to 40, completed a brief trait-based survey and then nominated a 7 -day period within which to receive seven text messages daily, at random intervals, prompting them to complete measures of body dissatisfaction at that moment. If they were currently or had recently engaged in <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> they {{were also asked to}} fill out questions rating the quality of these interactions (operationalized in terms of enjoyment of, and control in, the interaction). Findings suggest that the relationship between state body dissatisfaction and aspects <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> is complex and may vary over time. Cross-sectionally, state body dissatisfaction and <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> quality were negatively associated. Prospectively, however, body dissatisfaction predicted subsequent avoidance <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> Interestingly, when women chose to avoid <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> their body dissatisfaction worsened, yet when they did engage in <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> they reported improved body satisfaction. Importantly, the links between state body dissatisfaction and <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> may be moderated by body mass index and trait body satisfaction levels.

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction,</b> while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction.</b> If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

Despite the visual complexity <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> humans have often little difficulties to visually recognize <b>social</b> <b>interactions.</b> What is the visual representation <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions</b> and the bodily visual cues that promote this remarkable human ability? Viewpoint dependent representations {{are considered to be}} {{at the heart of the}} visual recognition of many visual stimuli including objects (B&# 252;lthoff & Edelman, 1992), and biological motion patterns (Verfaillie, 1993). Here we addressed the question whether complex social actions acted out between pairs of people, e. g. hugging, are also represented in a similar manner. To this end, we created 3 -D models from motion captured actions acted out by two people, e. g. hugging. These 3 -D models allowed to present the same action from different viewpoints. Participants task was to discriminate a target action from distractor actions using a one-interval-forced-choice (1 IFC) task. We measured participants&# 39; recognition performance in terms of reaction times (RT) and d-prime (d&# 39;). For each tested action we found one view that lead to superior recognition performance compared to other views.
