5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack <b>overheated</b> and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that <b>overheated,</b> and is working on a possible fix.|$|E

40|$|Regardless of {{the cause}} of <b>overheating,</b> the general and primary effect of <b>overheating</b> on an {{electronic}} component is damage. In this paper, the effects of excessive levels heat on different types of electronic components are explored and discussed. Take note that included in this discussion are the causes of <b>overheating</b> to better understand and appreciate the <b>overheating</b> phenomenon {{as it applies to}} electronic components, as well as electronic assemblies and electronic devices. Through a review of literature, especially studies and engineering reference materials, this paper found out that at the micro-level, <b>overheating</b> causes material degradation on or in a specific electronic component. This degradation is further caused by cracks, expansion, and other structural deformation. Note that this degradation is also caused by different changes in the physical and chemical properties of a specific material due to exposure to high levels of heat.

40|$|EN 13790 {{suggests}} some quasi-steady-state <b>overheating</b> indicator {{to evaluate}} the summer comfort in buildings.

40|$|In {{the drive}} to reduce {{space-heating}} demand and associated CO 2 emissions as well as tackle fuel poverty, dwelling <b>overheating</b> and summer-time occupant thermal discomfort might be the unintended consequences of low-energy building retrofits. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} steady-state modelled low energy retrofit dwelling in northern England and its potential current and future climate <b>overheating</b> risks using UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP 09) scenarios (2050 and 2080 High Emission Scenarios). Predictive findings highlight that retrofitting to low energy standards increases <b>overheating</b> risk over time, unless passive prevention measures are included in the retrofit design. In addition, the steady-state nature of the model might not fully capture the occupants’ exposure to actual future <b>overheating</b> risks. Among the most effective individual passive <b>overheating</b> mitigation strategies are temporary internal shading, permanent external shading, and night-time ventilation. Most effective is a combination of these adaptation measures, so that predictive <b>overheating</b> is minimised in a future changing climate, reducing the uptake of active cooling in retrofitted dwellings. Practical applications: Much research focuses on building <b>overheating</b> risks in the warmer South-east of England. However, this paper highlights how dwelling retrofit in north England (Sheffield) also can lead to increased dwelling <b>overheating</b> risk, unless passive design measures are included in the retrofit design. Among the most effective individual passive <b>overheating</b> mitigation strategies are solar shading devices and increased night-time ventilation, though ideally different measures are combined.

5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug.

This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When <b>overheated,</b> the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting <b>overheated.</b> An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E

He then traveled to England with a team of American riders to compete against a British riding team in the 1974 Transatlantic Match races. The conventional wisdom at the time was that American riders, who competed mostly in dirt track races, could not race on asphalt at the same level as the British riders, who specialized in road racing events. Roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of the six races and finishing second in the remaining three races. Roberts was the top individual points scorer in the event with 93 points, five more than Barry Sheene, the top British rider.|$|E
