5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it to games such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay difficulty was lower, while also making the same comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating difficulty through {{the lack of a}} money resource, rather than using money as the primary source <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in {{isometric}} projection. The player may change the level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, {{all of which can}} be increased by leveling up.|$|E
6000|$|The {{history of}} the session was {{described}} as the carriage of a single measure by a single man. Few British members understood it, none mastered it. The whigs were disaffected about it, the radicals doubted it, the tories thought that property as a principle was ruined by it, the Irishmen, when the humour seized them, bade him send the bill to line trunks. Mr. Gladstone, as one observer truly says, “faced difficulties such as no other bill of this country has ever encountered, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> politics and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> principle and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> detail, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> party and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> personnel, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> race and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> class, and he has never once failed, or even seemed to fail, in his clear command of the question, in his dignity and authority of demeanour, in his impartiality in accepting amending suggestions, in his firmness in resisting destructive suggestions, in his clear perception of his aim, and his strong grasp of the fitting means. And yet it is hardly possible to appreciate adequately the embarrassments of the situation.” ...|$|R

5|$|The V-scale, which {{originated}} in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.|$|E
5|$|The game {{focuses on}} three princes in the Burning Citadel where {{they and their}} men-at-arms {{fight to the death}} to gain the Throne of Fire after their father's death. Throne of Fire {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from industry critics, with some reviewers speaking positive of the graphics while other criticized the lack <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in the single player mode, instead recommending playing with two players.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its aesthetics, puzzle design, and {{fidelity to}} the series, but criticized its short length and disputed its degree <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> It was selected for a 2016 Apple Design Award, Apple's 2015 iPhone game of the year, and best mobile/handheld game at the 2015 The Game Awards.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received on release; critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The high level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> perceived lack of new content and courses, and paucity of new game features {{were seen as}} the game's primary faults. Despite generally good press, the game was a financial disappointment. Wipeout 3 was the last title in the series {{to appear on the}} PlayStation and the next entry, Wipeout Fusion, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 platform in 2002.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in {{campaign}} mode: Easy, Normal, Heroic, and Legendary. An increase in difficulty {{will result in}} an increase in the number, rank, health, damage, and accuracy of enemies; a reduction of duration and an increase in recharge time for the Arbiter's active camouflage; a decrease in the player's health and shields; and occasional changes in dialog.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{the game}} {{received}} critical acclaim and sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide within {{five months of}} release. The game's audio, dungeon and puzzle design, open structure, and level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> were highly praised by critics. The introduction of new features such as the wall-merging mechanics and item rental system were well received, with reviewers complimenting how well they integrated with the existing gameplay formula.

5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E
5|$|After Lord's, however, {{his form}} tailed away considerably: tormented by Australia's seam-bowling attack, his {{scores for the}} rest of the series were 13, 0 and 4, and 24 and 1, {{bringing}} his batting average for the five-match series down to 27.78. Collingwood's difficulties with the bat seemed to affect his usually high-class catching, and he dropped three chances of varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> on the final day of the series at the Oval, though he did take a sharp catch to dismiss Mitchell Johnson for a duck off Steve Harmison as part of England's surge to a 197-run victory in the match, and a 2–1 victory in the series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E

5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} and lack <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; {{he also noted}} technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's high level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{compared}} to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|Don't Starve was Klei's {{first foray}} into the {{survival}} genre. Conceived {{during the height of}} a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.|$|E

5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades (windbreaks) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé of the hardest level <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E
