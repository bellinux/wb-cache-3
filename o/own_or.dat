5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their <b>own</b> <b>or</b> in combination.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its <b>own</b> <b>or</b> with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, male {{variegated}} fairywrens {{have been}} observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's <b>own</b> <b>or</b> another territory.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's <b>own</b> <b>or</b> another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to <b>own</b> <b>or</b> breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our <b>own</b> <b>or</b> other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E

5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their <b>own</b> (<b>or</b> blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Muhammad, Onneca bore Abdullah two daughters: al-Baha' and Fatima the Younger. Abdullah became emir in 888, and Onneca's son Muhammad was named {{heir to the}} throne. However, Muhammad was assassinated by his younger half-brother al-Mutarrif on 28 January 891. There is disagreement among historians as to whether al-Mutarrif acted on his <b>own</b> <b>or</b> at the instigation of his father Abdullah. Al-Mutarrif himself was beheaded in 895 under orders of his father. As a result, Muhammad's son Abd-ar-Rahman, who was born three weeks prior to his father's assassination, {{was the one who}} succeeded his grandfather Abdullah as emir of Córdoba. Known in the West as Abd-ar-Rahman III, he later elevated himself to the position of caliph.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action on their <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> if King John was {{the driving force behind the}} election.|$|E

5|$|Sejmiks were {{significantly}} reformed by the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized {{as part of}} the Constitution of 3 May. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to <b>own</b> <b>or</b> lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.|$|E
5|$|She {{began work}} on another volume of memoirs and made {{appearances}} on the paid speaking circuit. There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions. She also made some unpaid speeches {{on behalf of the}} foundation. For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11million from her speeches. For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141million, paid some $56million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15million to charity. As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her <b>own,</b> <b>or</b> $45–53 million with her husband.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Canadian Regiment, {{also known}} as Congress' <b>Own</b> <b>or</b> Hazen's Regiment, was {{authorized}} on January 20, 1776, as an Extra Continental regiment {{and raised in the}} province of Quebec for service with the Continental Army under the command of Colonel Moses Hazen. All or part of the regiment saw action at Staten Island, Brandywine, Germantown and the Siege of Yorktown. Most of its non-combat time was spent in and around New York City as part of the forces monitoring the British forces occupying that city. The regiment was disbanded on November 15, 1783, at West Point, New York.|$|E

5|$|The {{involvement}} {{of those in}} Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, William Duer, James Duane, Gouverneur Morris, and Rufus King as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not <b>own</b> <b>or</b> deal {{a share in the}} debt. Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790. Although he was not against current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders. Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out of desperation. The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Muhammad's {{position in}} Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. As a result, {{the opposition to}} him became less vocal. Pagans {{who had not yet}} converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan of the Aws Manat tribe and Abu 'Afak of the 'Amr b. 'Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their <b>own</b> <b>or</b> related clans, and Muhammad did not disapprove of the killings. This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication. Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.|$|E

Its {{inhabitants}} were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms, hand loom weaving in their own homes, working in the local quarries or the small coal mines on Winter Hill Coal mining was on a very small scale. Nicholas Fish, Brooker and Company had a coal pit on Wilders Moor that was mentioned on the 1869 and 1880 mines lists. in 1896 the Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal from the Mountain coal seam for <b>own</b> <b>or</b> local use.|$|E
