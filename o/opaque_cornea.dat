50|$|GSTs {{catalyze}} sulfation at the 6-hydroxyl {{group of}} galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or N-acetylglucosamine. Like heparan sulfotransferases, GSTs {{are responsible for}} post-translational protein sulfation that assists in cell-signaling. GSTs are also responsible for the sulfation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that assist with maintaining the structure between cells For example, GSTs catalyze the sulfation of glycoproteins displaying the L-selectin binding epitope 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x, which recruits leukocytes to areas of chronic inflammation. GSTs are also responsible for the proper function of the ECM in the cornea; improper sulfation by GSTs can lead to <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas.</b>|$|R

Methods: Seventy eyes of 58 patients who had penetrating keratoplasty {{were included in the}} study. High resolution AS-OCT scans of the cornea and the anterior segment were performed before and after transplantation in 17 eyes with the VisanteTM optical coherence tomography. Fifty-three eyes were examined in the late postoperative period. Results: The mean follow-up was 4. 3 years (range, 1 – 15 years). Six different graft–host junctions were identified. Three patients with graft rejection, four patients with anterior synechia, and three patients with corneal ulcer were evaluated. Preoperative evaluation of eyes with semiopaque and totally <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas</b> revealed important information about anterior segment structures additional to slit-lamp findings.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{femtosecond}} lasers {{are routinely}} used in refractive eye surgery. Until recently, commercialised clinical systems were exclusively based on ytterbium or neodymium-doped solid state lasers emitting sub-picosecond pulses at a wavelength of about 1 µm and repetition rates {{of a few}} 10 kHz. These systems use pulse energies in the µJ range and focussing optics of NA = 0. 3 to 0. 5. Recent developments have provided a variety of alternative and equally viable approaches: systems are now available using nJ pulses at high numerical apertures and MHz repetition rates - an approach so far only used for femtosecond cell surgery - and fibre laser technology is now being used for femtosecond laser corneal surgery. Recent research has also provided more insight in side effects occurring in present systems: self focusing phenomena and so far unexplained periodical structures have been observed even at high numerical apertures (NA >> 0. 5) and moderate pulse energies. The interaction of femtosecond laser pulses with strongly scattering tissue has been studied in view of extending the application of femtosecond lasers to keratoplasty for <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas</b> and to glaucoma surgery. The use of new laser wavelengths and adaptive optics has been proposed. Despite the reputation of femtosecond surgical systems for their precision, repeatability {{and the absence of}} secondary effects or complications, a closer examination reveals the presence of subtle phenomena which merit further investigation.

40|$|A 10 month {{old girl}} was {{referred}} to our glaucoma department with the tentative diagnosis of unilateral buphthalmos. The parents had noticed photophobia, epiphora and an <b>opaque</b> <b>cornea</b> {{on the left side}} since one month. An intra-ocular pressure of 50 mmHg had been measured in that eye under sedation by the consulted ophthalmologist. On clinical examination, there was an opaque megalocornea with esodeviation on the left. The right eye appeared normal. Because of the photophobia and the <b>opaque</b> <b>cornea,</b> fundoscopy was not possible without sedation. The working diagnosis remained left buphthalmos and a trabeculotomy was planned. Examination under general anesthesia revealed corneal oedema, a shallow anterior chamber with an atrophic iris and engorged iris vessels on the left side. Since a shallow anterior chamber is not a typical feature of buphthalmos, an expansive process in the posterior segment was suspected. Fundoscopy only revealed a red reflex in {{the upper part of the}} eye; details could not be visualized because of corneal edema. The right eye had a normal anterior and posterior segment. Ultrasonography revealed a large mass in the left vitreous space. Calcifications within this mass were suspected on the bases of retro-shadows, making the diagnosis of retinoblastoma very likely.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 71 aphakic New Zealand albino rabbit eyes, experimental endophthalmitis was created by injecting 10 (5) colony-forming units of Staphylococcal aureus. The animals were divided into 5 groups. One control group was followed up without treatment, while 4 groups were treated with vitrectomy and intraocular cefazolin injection. Two groups were also treated with intramuscular methylprednisolone, 1 group beginning {{on the day of}} surgery and 1 group beginning on the following day. In the final group, dexamethasone, 400 micrograms, was injected into the vitreous cavity at the close of surgery. Culture results were compared on the first 2 days after surgery. Inflammatory scores, including development of total corneal opacity, were assessed over a 21 -day follow-up period, and histopathologic grading was carried out {{at the conclusion of the}} clinical observations. RESULTS: Simultaneous administration of systemic corticosteroids beginning on the day of vitrectomy decreased inflammatory scores 1 week after institution of therapy but did not affect final scores. Delay of initiation of intramuscular corticosteroid until the first postoperative day negated the positive effects. Administration of intraocular corticosteroids was associated with an increase in inflammatory scores throughout the period of observation, an increase in percentage of eyes that developed <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas,</b> an increase in choroidal inflammation graded moderate or severe, and an increase in retinal necrosis compared with vitrectomy and cefazolin injection alone.

40|$|PURPOSE. To report intra- and interinstrument {{calibration}} {{methods for}} corneal backscatter analysis by in vivo confocal microscopy. METHODS. Applicability of two reference standards was evaluated for corneal backscatter calibration. Repeated measurements of four concentrations of AMCO Clear (GFS Chemicals, Inc., Powell, OH) suspension and three transparencies (26 %, 49 %, and 65 %) of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) slabs {{were performed to}} assess image intensity acquisition in a wide backscatter range. Intra- and intersession repeatability and lot-to-lot variation were determined for both standards. The effect of light intensity (LI) variation on image intensity acquisition was evaluated by examination of PMMA slabs with nonreference (60 % and 80 %) and reference (72 %) LIs. Both reference standards were implemented in the protocol. Intrainstrument calibration was verified by measuring three normal corneas with 60 %, 72 %, and 80 % LIs. Interinstrument calibration was tested by measuring PMMA slabs on a second, similar confocal microscope. RESULTS. AMCO Clear was used to express image intensity in absolute scatter units (SU), whereas the 49 % transparent PMMA slab showed best repeatability, without image saturation, to adjust for LI variation. Intrainstrument calibration for LI variation reduced mean differences from - 38. 3 % to 1. 7 % (60 % LI) and from 33. 9 % to - 0. 6 % (80 % LI). The mean difference between similar microscopes decreased from 18. 4 % to 1. 2 %, after calibration of the second microscope. CONCLUSIONS. Large interinstrument differences necessitate calibration of corneal backscatter measurements. With AMCO Clear suspension and PMMA slabs, standardization was achieved in a wide backscatter range corresponding to normal and <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas.</b> These methods can easily be applied in ophthalmic practice. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Background. Confocal {{microscopy}} is {{a diagnostic}} method used for {{examination of the}} morphological structure of the cornea in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo. Methods. Using a confocal microscope (Confoscan 2. 0, Nidek, Japan), we can determine and analyze morphological changes in individual layers of the cornea, from epithelial to stromal and endothelial ones in addition, it is possible to observe keratitis causing agents. According to the findings revealed, we choose a treatment method and a surgical procedure type. The investigation is aimed to determine a cellular density in different layers of the cornea, i. e., that of epithelial cells, stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells. Monitoring cellular density by layers helps us understand the cell response after corneal damage or surgery of the anterior segment of the eye. Conclusions. The method is clinically applicable also in an <b>opaque</b> <b>cornea</b> occurring as a result of epithelial or stromal edema. Such investigations were not feasible before the introduction of the confocal microscopy. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Inflammatory {{cells and}} antigen {{presenting}} cells (APC) are not present {{under normal circumstances}} in {{the centre of the}} healthy cornea. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate and phenotype the inflammatory cell populations, particularly with reference to T cell subpopulations and macrophages, and to localise dendritic cells (DC) and other MHC class II positive cells in three groups of grafted corneas: rejected non-inflamed, rejected inflamed grafts, and control dystrophic explants.  METHODS— 15 corneal buttons removed during keratoplasty from non-inflamed "quiet" previously grafted corneas, five inflamed corneas requiring urgent regrafting for "graft melting" (in "high risk" corneas), and 10  control dystrophic <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas</b> explanted during their first graft procedure were examined. Cryosections of corneas were immunostained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 14, CD 25, CD 68, HLA-DP, and HLA-DR molecules using the StreptABC method. DC were detected by dual immunostaining as CD 1 a+ and MHC class II+ and CD 19 −. Cell densities in immunostained tissue sections were evaluated using a scale from 0  to + 4.  RESULTS—Immunostaining in control dystrophic corneas was negative for all antibodies. A moderate to high density of CD 8 +, CD 14 +, and CD 68 + cells was observed in the majority of rejected non-inflamed as well as in rejected inflamed corneal buttons. Strong positivity for HLA-DP and HLA-DR molecules in the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium was also demonstrated. Weak positivity for CD 4 and CD 25 was observed in six of 15  and 11  of 15  rejected corneas, respectively. The presence of dendritic cells in the basal layer of the epithelium and in the stroma was observed in 50 % of the grafts.  CONCLUSIONS—A high frequency of macrophages, the presence of DC in the explants, and strong expression of HLA-DP and HLA-DR molecules on resident cells are characteristics of rejected corneal allografts, whether actively inflamed or not. The presence of DC in the stroma of the grafted cornea suggests that they may be mainly responsible for T cell activation and graft rejection since DC are known to be a 100 -fold more potent than macrophages as APC. ...|$|R
40|$|Allograft {{rejection}} is {{the main}} cause of corneal graft failure. T lymphocytes and macrophages have been implied to be involved in corneal rejection, but {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanism in this process. In this study, cytokine mRNA expression in the cornea was analysed during experimental corneal transplantation. The donor and acceptor corneas of two groups of rats were studied after receiving an allo- (PVG to AO rat) or autograft (AO rat). For controls, central buttons and peripheral corneal rings of the non-transplanted contralateral eyes were used. At different post-operative days (1, 3, 7, 12 and 19), the corneas were removed and subjected to mRNA isolation. All corneal samples underwent semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 1, receptor antagonist, interleukin- 2, interleukin- 4, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 mRNA expression. Corneal rejection, characterized by <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas</b> with prominent neovascularization, was always diagnosed around day 12. Contralateral, non-grafted corneas showed constitutive mRNA expression for interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist and in a few samples also monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 mRNA was found. Both allo- and autografts expressed mRNA for the cytokines found in contralateral, non-grafted tissue, as well as for interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In allografts, the mRNA levels for these cytokines remained constant throughout all post-operative days, with increased interleukin- 6 mRNA expression after post-operative day 12. The analysis of the autografts revealed high cytokine mRNA levels until post-operative day 3 or 7, which decreased from then on, except for interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist. mRNA for interleukin- 2, interleukin- 4 and interferon-gamma was not observed in autografts at any time point and in allografts, until post-operative day 12. Interleukin- 2 and interferon-gamma mRNA showed maximal expression on POD 12, while in autografts, a marked decrease was observed after POD 3. IL- 10 mRNA levels decreased immediately after POD 1 in autografted eyes. For TNF-alpha, an increased mRNA expression starting on POD 7 was found in recipient rings of allografted eyes, while in autografts a weak expression was seen in some samples. MIP- 2 transcription increased on PAD 12, while in autografts, its expression was not markedly different from that detected in the contralateral, non-grafted peripheral corne...|$|R
30|$|Streptococcosis, a {{bacterial}} disease, {{is one of}} the most significant diseases of tilapia worldwide. The causative agents of the disease have been attributed to multiple bacterial agents but most commonly Streptococcus and/or Lactococcus (Kang et al. 2004; Plumb and Hanson 2011). Streptococcosis is a common disease affecting various species of fish worldwide (Roberts 2012) including the Asian seabass (Suanyuk et al. 2010), barramundi (Bromage et al. 1999), grouper (Bowater et al. 2012), Japanese flounder (Nguyen et al. 2002), rabbit fish (Yuasa et al. 1999), rainbow trout (Eldar and Ghittino 1999), red drum (Eldar et al. 1999; Shen et al. 2005), red tilapia (Hernandez et al. 2009; Musa et al. 2009), seabream (Evans et al. 2002), silver pomfret (Duremdez et al. 2004), and wild mullet (Evans et al. 2002). An annual global loss of about 250 million USD has been attributed to streptococcosis (Amal and Zamri-Saad 2011). The clinical signs of streptococcosis or lactococcosis include unilateral or bilateral exophthalmia, erratic swimming, pale gills, <b>opaque</b> <b>cornea,</b> external haemorrhages, enlarged spleen, ascites in abdominal cavities, and discolored liver (Suanyuk et al. 2005; Salati 2011).|$|E

During a monitoring survey of the health status of tilapia in Lake Sentani from 2010 to 2013, severe morbidity and mortality were observed. Clinical symptoms included long white fecal string, erratic swimming, pale gills, <b>opaque</b> <b>cornea,</b> and exophthalmus. The isolated bacteria were β-haemolytic, Gram positive, non-motile cocci, and presumptively identified as Streptococcus sp. Biochemical testing failed to identify the bacteria to the species level. Despite the significant losses of tilapia due to streptococcal infection in Indonesia, few studies {{are available on the}} etiology of streptococcosis/lactococcosis in naturally infected fish. Furthermore, a more definitive identification of the causative agents using molecular techniques are currently lacking in Indonesia. For these reasons, the main goal of our study is to identify the causative agent(s) of streptococcosis among cage cultured tilapia in Lake Sentani, Papua, Indonesia using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. As a secondary objective, healthy tilapia were intraperitoneally inoculated with the bacterial isolates to confirm the etiology of the disease.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Corneas swollen in vitro, at {{physiological}} pH with a bounding membrane {{will remain}} transparent even at pH 8 (Huang Y and Meek KM, Biophysics J. 77, 1655 - 1665, 1999) while corneas swollen in vivo become opaque. Our {{purpose was to}} compare the swelling of Fuchs' dystrophy and normal corneas to explain this anomalous behaviour. METHOD. Experiment 1 : Bovine corneas were swollen at pH 8 and pH 5 and final pH 3. 2 and pH 5 using a bounding membrane. Experiment 2 : Normal and Fuchs’ dystrophy corneas were either swollen by addition of physiological saline or were equilibrated against different concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in phosphate buffer {{to a range of}} final hydrations. The corneas were examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS. Experiment 1 : At pH 8 the corneas at both hydrations appeared clear while at pH 5 the corneas at both hydrations appeared opaque. XRD revealed no correlation between collagen interfibrillar spacing, fibrilar diameter and appearance of tissue. But a correlation was observed between degree oforder of the fibril packing and appearance of tissue. A high degree of order was found in the clear corneas while a low degree of order occurred in <b>opaque</b> <b>corneas.</b> Experiment 2 : Both normal and Fuchs’ dystrophy corneas swelled on addition of saline. All saline-swollen corneaswere opaque. Although the final hydrations were different, XRD revealed there was little difference in interfibrillar spacing between Fuchs’ dystrophy and normal corneas, but a low degree of fibril packing order was observed. TEM revealed the presence of numerous large intra-lamellar ’lakes’. CONCLUSION. Corneas swollen in vitro appear opaque because of the formation of collagen-free ’lakes’ and an accompanying disordering of the fibril packing. Swelling with a bounding membrane in the region of neutral pH can reduce these effects and allow a more even water distribution and hence a clearer cornea. Differences in the swelling behaviour of normal and Fuchs' dystrophy corneas may relate to compositional changes in the source of the osmotic force controlling hydration (probably including changes in proteoglycans) manifested here by a different response to equilibration against PEG. The X-ray diffraction and electron microscope results suggest the presence of more ’lake’ formation as the Fuchs' cornea swells (compared to the swollen normal cornea) perhaps for the same reasons. The distribution of tissue water, and hence the resulting light scattering in Fuchs' dystrophy corneas, is probably a consequence of these compositional changes, which do not occur when normal corneas are swollen in vitro near neutral pH with a bounding membrane...|$|R
40|$|The use of split-thickness dermal grafts for {{successful}} repair of corneal and scleral defects is reported in 10 patients (11 eyes) who had non-infectious, impending, or overt ocular perforation.

Corneo-scleral defects occurred after various operations: pterygium excision, retinal detachment repair, insertion of a keratoprosthesis (Cardona implant) into an <b>opaque,</b> vascularised <b>cornea,</b> and penetrating keratoplasty. Other causes of corneoscleral defects were scleromalacia perforans, idiopathic systemic vasculitis, alkali burn, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and band keratopathy with recurrent erosion following intraocular metallic foreign body.

Methods: Cross-sectional study that included 25 eyes of 15 patients suffering from PCG and a control group of 15 eyes of ten age- and sex-matched participants. Diagnosis of PCG was based on clinical data (intraocular pressure, corneal diameter, fundus examination and amplitude-modulation scan measurement of axial length). UBM examination was done for all participants for measurement of central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, iris thickness (measured 2 mm from the iris root and again at the thickest point near the pupil), zonular length, posterior chamber depth, and angle of anterior chamber. Qualitative evaluation was done for abnormal angle membranes, iris insertion level, and ciliary processes position and configuration. Results: Mean age ± standard deviation was 10. 32 ± 3. 59 months in the study group and 14. 54 ± 5. 9  months in the control group. The central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, zonular length, and angle of anterior chamber were significantly larger in the study group than in the control group, with mean values 700 ± 190 µm, 3. 55 ± 0. 32 mm, 1. 02 ± 0. 15 mm, and 58. 47 °± 5. 57 °, respectively. The posterior chamber depth had a mean of 0. 33 ± 0. 06 mm, which was significantly smaller {{than that of the}} control group. In the study group, the mean iris thickness 2  mm from the iris root was 0. 32 ± 0. 04 mm, the mean iris thickness at the thickest point near the pupil was 0. 38 ± 0. 08 mm, and the mean lens thickness was 3. 32 ± 0. 18 mm. These three parameters were smaller than the control group but the difference was insignificant. Loss of normal iris configuration was detected in all eyes of the study group.

40|$|Treatment of corneal {{epithelial}} diseases {{induced by}} limbal stem cell deficiency {{is an important}} challenge in ocular surface reconstruction. Since the 1990 s, corneal stem cells have been localized in the limbus. This new concept completely {{changed the way we}} consider ocular surface reconstruction, with new diseases now found to be isolated in the ocular surface. Limbus insufficiency syndromes are specific depending on their origin (congenital or acquired), their expression (unilateral or bilateral, partial or total), their progression (acute or chronic), and the mechanism involved (burn, infection, chronic inflammation, etc.). Some of these diseases are local diseases and others are systemic diseases. Clinically, limbus insufficiency is a switch of the normal corneal epithelial phenotype (expression of a specific keratin, avascularity, and transparency of the corneal matrix) in an <b>opaque</b> and fibrovascularized <b>cornea.</b> In terms of cellular biology, a phenotype is a terminal expression of a cell differentiation process.

Outcome measures: Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT); palpatory assessment of IOP; Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg), corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc), corneal resistance factor (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) assessed by Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA); central corneal thickness (CCT) and density assessed with Pentacam. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed effect models and Spearman correlation coefficients. The concordance between tonometry methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. There was no relevant difference between study groups regarding median GAT, IOPg, IOPcc and CCT measurements. The limits of agreement between GAT and IOPcc/IOPg/palpatory IOP in MPS were: [- 11. 7 to 12. 1 mmHg], [- 8. 6 to 15. 5 mmHg] and [- 5. 4 to 10. 1 mmHg] respectively. Limits of agreement were less wide in healthy subjects and Fabry patients. Palpatory IOP was higher in MPS than in healthy controls and Fabry patients. Corneal opacity correlated more strongly with GAT, IOPg, CH, CRF, CCT and corneal density in MPS (r = 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 6, 0. 6 respectively) than in Fabry patients (r = 0. 3, 0. 2, - 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, - 0. 2 respectively). In contrast, IOPcc revealed less correlation with corneal opacity than GAT in MPS (r = 0. 2 vs. 0. 4). ORA and GAT render less comparable IOP-values in patients suffering from MPS-associated corneal opacity in comparison to Fabry and healthy controls. The IOP seems to be overestimated in <b>opaque</b> MPS-affected <b>corneas.</b> GAT, IOPg and biomechanical parameters of the cornea correlate more strongly with the corneal clouding than IOPcc in MPS patients.

40|$|Bilateral corneal {{blindness}} {{represents a}} quarter of the total blind, world-wide. The artificial cornea in assorted forms, was developed to replace <b>opaque</b> non-functional <b>corneas</b> and to return sight in otherwise hopeless cases that were not amenable to corneal grafts; believed to be 2 % of corneal blind. Despite technological advances in materials design and tissue engineering no artificial cornea has provided absolute, long-term success. Formidable problems exist, due to a combination of unpredictable wound healing and unmanageable pathology. To have a solid guarantee of reliable success an artificial cornea must possess three attributes: an optical window to replace the opaque cornea; a strong, long term union to surrounding ocular tissue; and the ability to induce desired host responses. A unique artificial cornea possesses all three functional attributes- the Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP). The OOKP has a high success rate and can survive for up to twenty years, but it is complicated both in structure and in surgical procedure; it is expensive and not universally available. The aim of this project was to develop a synthetic substitute for the OOKP, based upon key features of the tooth and bone structure. In doing so, surgical complexity and biological complications would be reduced. Analysis of the biological effectiveness of the OOKP showed that the structure of bone was the most crucial component for implant retention. An experimental semi-rigid hydroxyapatite framework was fabricated with a complex bone-like architecture, which could be fused to the optical window. The first method for making such a framework, was pressing and sintering of hydroxyapatite powders; however, {{it was not possible to}} fabricate a void architecture with the correct sizes and uniformity of pores. Ceramers were synthesised using alternative pore forming methods, providing for improved mechanical properties and stronger attachment to the plastic optical window. Naturally occurring skeletal structures closely match the structural features of all forms of natural bone. Synthetic casts were fabricated using the replamineform process, of desirable natural artifacts, such as coral and sponges. The final method of construction by-passed ceramic fabrication in favour of pre-formed coral derivatives and focused on methods for polymer infiltration, adhesion and fabrication. Prototypes were constructed and evaluated; a fully penetrative synthetic OOKP analogue was fabricated according to the dimensions of the OOKP. Fabrication of the cornea shaped OOKP synthetic analogue was also attempted...|$|R
