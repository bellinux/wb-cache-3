5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1084 and 1504, Worcester Cathedral {{represents}} every medieval style from Norman to Perpendicular. It {{is famous}} for its Norman crypt, and for its circular chapter house, which became the model from which derives the series of uniquely British polygonal chapter houses. Also notable are a series <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> Transitional Gothic bays, fine woodwork and the central tower, which, though not large, is nevertheless of particularly fine proportions.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astrology has a close {{relation}} with Chinese philosophy (theory {{of the three}} harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.|$|E

5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but capable <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> clemency. He was in {{many ways}} a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s until 2009 the {{buildings}} were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a biomass boiler installed.

5|$|The {{hermeneutic}} {{style is}} {{a style of}} Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the extensive use <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> and arcane words, especially derived from Greek.

In the early medieval period, some leading Continental scholars were exponents, including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny.|$|E

5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety <b>of</b> <b>unusual</b> shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
