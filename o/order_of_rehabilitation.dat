Concerning the way medical and socio-political conceptual models are embedded in the texts, the analysis has revealed three <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> discourse: The discourse of reaction, the discourse of action, and the discourse of pro-action. The analysis outlines the repositioning <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> to adhere to socio-political approaches; however, it also questions whether this social turn has some unintended consequences...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} factor in seismic rehabilitation planning for infrastructure assets. An inventory of structures is screened to identify seismically susceptible parts and prioritize them in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> need for <b>rehabilitation</b> purposes. In most cases, the financial resources for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure assets are limited. Therefore, there is a need to efficiently allocate such resources to various projects. The main goal of this research is to develop a budget allocation management model for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure projects, when there isn’t sufficient budget to allocate to all projects. Accordingly, a decision support system is developed and exercised in this research to optimize the budget for rehabilitation projects in three categories of road structures. To accomplish this, a computer-based Multiple Strategy Budget Allocation decision support System (MSBAS©) was developed to identify (including selection and prioritization) the best configuration (package) <b>of</b> seismic <b>rehabilitation</b> projects across existing structures. This system employs a multi-criteria assessment module that takes into account desirable criteria to estimate the financial needs for rehabilitation based on the existing budget constraints in a fiscal year. To select the optimal package of projects, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization module is also developed. Multi-objective decision making is conducted under a specific decision strategy with solving a 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the GA-based approach, a hypothetical decision making problem is presented. Using this system, managers can compare their decisions for different strategies and significantly improve management efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Objective. A {{proposal}} for a conceptual description <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> was made in 2007 based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. This conceptual description should foster {{the development of a}} common understanding <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and its professions. The present paper aims to report on the development and current state of the discussions about this conceptual description and to provide the current version, which has been adopted by different European professional and scientific organizations. Methods. First, the history of the development of the conceptual description <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> is reported. Secondly, suggestions for modifications or amendments are introduced, and the resulting phrases and terms are presented and discussed. Discussion and conclusion. One major change to the conceptual description <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> is the explicit integration of the perspective of the disabled person. The relationship between person and provider is characterized as a partnership. However, it is argued that quality of life should not be introduced as a primary goal <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> This conceptual description can foster a common understanding <b>of</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> professions and provide a point of departure for clarifying the role of different professions and services within the broad field <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> It can also serve to position rehabilitation as a major health strategy and to sharpen the perception <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> among external stakeholders...|$|R

Within {{the context of}} a broadening appreciation of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> interest in the nature <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> is growing. Some believe that rehabilitation services do not adequately meet the needs of patients. Others are interested in the readiness of patients to participate in rehabilitation. Design. Qualitative.

According to nurses working in inpatient rehabilitation units, there is a marked incongruence between nurses 2 ̆ 7 understandings and expectations <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and what they perceive patients to understand and expect.

Relevance to clinical practice. Before patients are transferred to rehabilitation, the purpose and nature <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> in particular the roles of patients and nurses, needs to be explained to them. The understandings <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> that nurses in this study possessed provide a framework for the design of education materials and orientation programmes that inform patients (and their families) about rehabilitation.
