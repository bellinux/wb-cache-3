5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands fully, as an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his <b>other</b> <b>holdings</b> in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E

5|$|In 229 BC, Rome {{declared}} war on Illyria {{and for the first}} time armies crossed the Adriatic to Illyria (the Balkan Peninsula in modern usage). An army consisting of approximately 20,000 troops, 200 cavalry units and an entire Roman fleet of 200 ships was sent to conquer Corcyra. Teuta's governor, Demetrius had little alternative but to surrender, and the Romans awarded him a considerable part of Teuta's holdings (228 BC). The Roman army then landed further north at Apollonia. The combined army and navy proceeded northward together, subduing one town after another and eventually besieging the capital Scodra. Teuta finally surrendered in 227 BC, having to accept an ignominious peace. The Romans allowed her to continue her reign but restricted her to a narrow region around Scodra, deprived her of all her <b>other</b> <b>holdings,</b> and forbade her to sail an armed ship south of Lissus. They also required her to pay an annual tribute and to acknowledge the final authority of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Jennings retired {{with his}} wife, Clarissa, {{to his home}} in Charlestown. Tipton may have felt it had been mistake to force Jennings out of public service and hoped that work would force him to give up alcohol. In 1831 Tipton secured Jennings an {{appointment}} to negotiate a treaty with native tribes in northern Indiana. Jennings attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Tippecanoe, but the delegation failed in their attempt. Afterwards, Jennings returned to his farm, where his health steadily declined. He continued drinking alcohol, spending considerable time a local tavern, and was frequently discovered sleeping in streets or in roadside ditches. Jenning's alcoholism worsened {{to the point where he}} was no longer able to tend his farm. Without a steady income Jennings's creditors began moving to seize his estate. In 1832 Tipton acquired the mortgage on Jennings's farm and enlisted the help of a local financier, James Lanier, to acquire the debts on Jennings's <b>other</b> <b>holdings.</b> Tipton allowed Jennings to remain on his mortgaged farm for the remainder of Jennings's life and encouraged Lanier to grant the same permission.|$|E

25|$|The most {{detailed}} economic {{records for the}} region are of the Marquesado's ranching haciendas, which produced draft animals (horses, mules, burros, and oxen) and sheep and goats, for meat and wool. Cattle ranching for meat, tallow, and leather were also important. Tallow for candles used in churches and residences and leather used {{in a variety of}} ways (saddles, other tack, boots, furniture, machinery) were significant items in the larger colonial economy, finding markets well beyond Tehuantepec. Since the Marquesado operated as an integrated enterprise, draft animals were used in <b>other</b> <b>holdings</b> for transport, agriculture, and mining in Oaxaca, Morelos, Toluca, and Mexico City as well as sold. Raised in Tehuantepec, the animals were driven to other Marquesado holdings for use and distribution.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important to know, for instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As noted earlier, a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the <b>other</b> <b>holdings</b> were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may have come at a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mention of}} Warkworth Castle {{occurs in a}} charter of 1157–1164 from HenryII {{granting}} the castle and surrounding manor to Roger fitz Richard, {{a member of a}} noble Norman family. It has been suggested that this charter may have used the term castle to describe a high-status residence on the site, possibly dating from the Anglo-Saxon period, meaning Roger may have built the castle. He owned lands across a wide area, and Warkworth may have been of little significance in the context of his <b>other</b> <b>holdings.</b> When the Scots invaded Northumberland in 1173, although Roger fitz Richard was in the county Warkworth Castle was not defended by its garrison. Its defences at the time were described as [...] "feeble". In 1174 DuncanII, Earl of Fife, raided Warkworth. The contemporary record does not mention the castle, and instead notes that Warkworth's inhabitants sought refuge in the church. When Roger fitz Richard died in 1178 his son and heir, Robert fitz Roger, was still a child. A guardian looked after the family estates until Robert came of age in 1191. He paid the Crown 300marks in 1199 for confirmation of his ownership of Warkworth, including the castle. Substantial building work at Warkworth Castle is attributed to Robert. A favourite of King John, Robert hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213.|$|E
