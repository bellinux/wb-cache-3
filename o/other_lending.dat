25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and <b>other</b> <b>lending</b> institutions. In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
