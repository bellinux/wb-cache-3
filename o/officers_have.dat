5|$|Virtually all <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> now changed positions, {{but this}} list gives {{an outline of}} the {{structure}} in January 2005. Despite the planned subdivision of the country into more numerous provinces, the actual splitting of the former provinces has not taken place.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{established}} the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) on June 4, 1976. MTPD police <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> jurisdiction and arrest powers for crimes that occur throughout the 1,500 square mile (3,900km2) Transit Zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In December 2010, MTPD began conducting random searches of carry-on bags for explosive and weapons at checkpoints located at randomly designated Metrorail stations.|$|E
5|$|Eleven NDA <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} the Ashok Chakra, India's highest peacetime gallantry award. Of them, {{one is from}} the Air Force and the remainder are from the Army. Ten officers {{received the}} award posthumously. Wing commander Rakesh Sharma of the Air Force is the only living NDA Air Force officer to receive the award.|$|E

50|$|Within 35 {{days of the}} 17 December anti-corruption operations, 5,000 police <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been {{designated}} to positions elsewhere in the Directorate of Security. Interior Minister Efkan Ala made a live statement claiming that 1,000 <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been moved to new positions and 5,000 <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been moved in a routine procedure. He claimed {{that this was a}} small percentage of re-designations compared to the total workforce of 260,000 officers.|$|R
5|$|In Arizona v. Gant (2009), the Court {{ruled that}} a law {{enforcement}} officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) {{at the time of}} the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|No officer {{whose career}} {{was spent in}} the British Army has ever reached the rank of field marshal without having served in the cavalry, infantry, Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers. Two non-British <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> been {{appointed}} field marshals in the British Army—Ferdinand Foch of France and Sir Thomas Blamey of Australia, in recognition of their contributions in the First and Second World Wars respectively—while only one, Sir William Robertson, held every rank in the British Army, from private soldier to field marshal.|$|E
5|$|Petty <b>Officers</b> <b>have</b> been an {{important}} part of the U.S. Navy since its beginning. They were originally appointed by the ship's captain and usually held such appointments while serving under the captain who selected them. The Petty Officers of this time did not have uniforms or a rank insignia. In 1841 a rate badge was assigned, consisting of a sleeve device displaying an eagle perched on an anchor. Rating marks did not appear until 1866.|$|E
50|$|Through the World War I era, the {{campaign}} hat worn by American soldiers was fairly soft. Those {{worn by the}} United States Army's general <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> a golden cord around it, whereas other commissioned <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> a golden-and-black campaign cord around their hat. Field clerks, {{as well as their}} post-war successors the warrant <b>officers,</b> <b>had</b> a silver-and-black cord, while other ranks had cords in their branch-of-service colors. The United States Marine Corps had the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor badge in black at the front of their campaign hats; its <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> an additional golden-and-scarlet cord around their hat, whereas its other ranks had none.|$|R
5000|$|By 13:00, {{thousands}} of police <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> encircled the government district and begun chasing down protesters. One protester {{with a head}} wound told the Kyiv Post that charging police <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> [...] "smashed everybody" [...] in their path.|$|R
50|$|Customs <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> wide-ranging {{powers of}} entry, search and detention. The main power was to detain {{anyone who had}} committed, or who the <b>officer</b> <b>had</b> {{reasonable}} grounds to suspect had committed, any offence under the Customs and Excise Acts.|$|R
5|$|Thirty-one NDA <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second-highest wartime gallantry award: {{two from the}} Air Force, one from the Navy and the remainder from the Army. Ten {{received the}} award posthumously. Air Force squadron leader Padmanabha Gautam is the only NDA officer to receive the award twice, in 1965 and 1971 (posthumously).|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new class}} of army junior <b>officer</b> (...) <b>had</b> emerged who were trained to European {{standards}} and believed themselves superior to their senior officers. In addition, various senior <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> become identified {{with the government and}} political structure, a source of criticism from the tenentes.|$|R
25|$|The {{captain of}} Flight 407 had slept for only six hours during the twenty-four {{hours before the}} accident, while the first <b>officer</b> <b>had</b> had eight hours sleep in the same period. The captain had flown a total 99 hours during the prior month, one hour short of the maximum 100 flying hours allowed by Emirates, while the first <b>officer</b> <b>had</b> flown 90 hours in the same period.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} issue, Cory {{found that the}} {{evidence}} should not be excluded under section 24(2). An objective observer would find that the <b>officer</b> <b>had</b> reasonable and probable ground {{to suspect that the}} bags contained stolen property. Likewise, the <b>officer</b> <b>had</b> reasonable subjective belief in his grounds.|$|R
5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship {{agreement with the}} telecommunications company Telenor, where the latter would pay up to NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} of police <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E
5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{only two}} Indian Army <b>officers</b> <b>have</b> been conferred the rank. It was first conferred to Sam Manekshaw in 1973, in {{recognition}} of his service and leadership in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. In 1971, after the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to field marshal and subsequently to appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). This appointment was dropped after several objections from the bureaucracy and the commanders of the navy and the air force. On 3 January 1973, after his term as the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. As {{it was the first}} appointment, several entitlements of the rank, including the badges and ribbons, were yet to worked out. A few weeks before Manekshaw's appointment, the field marshal's badges of rank were made at the Army workshop in Delhi Cantonment. They were inspired by the British field marshal insignia.|$|E
