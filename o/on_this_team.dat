When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>team</b> and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal."
