2500|$|The real {{scale and}} impact of SIS {{activities}} during <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War remains unknown, however, because <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> their most successful targeting operations against Soviet officials were <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> [...] "Third Country" [...] operations recruiting Soviet sources travelling abroad in Asia and Africa. These included the defection to the SIS Tehran station in 1982 of KGB officer Vladimir Kuzichkin, <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> a senior Politburo member and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB's</b> internal Second Chief Directorate who provided SIS and the British government with warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB's</b> Alpha Force during the 1991 August Coup which briefly toppled Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.|$|R

Malory notes {{that she would have}} known if there was a mole at ISIS, her earlier phone call shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b> She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s {{he served}} on various {{undercover}} assignments overseas. In 1956, for example, he accompanied the Soviet team to the Olympic Games in Australia.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Secret Service {{learns that}} Maria Freudenstein, an {{employee}} {{known to be}} a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewelry crafted by Peter Carl Fabergé and is planning to auction it at Sotheby's. Bond suspects that the Resident Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as persona non grata.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966 — the first such public trials since Stalin's day — marked the {{reversion}} to a repressive cultural policy. Under Yuri Andropov the state security service (in the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB)</b> regained some of the powers it had enjoyed under Stalin, {{although there was no}} return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s, and Stalin's legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia.|$|E
2500|$|A {{member of}} Cheka {{was called a}} [...] "chekist". Also, the term [...] "chekist" [...] often {{referred}} to Soviet secret police throughout the Soviet period, despite official name changes over time. In The Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn recalls that zeks in the labor camps used [...] "old 'Chekist'" [...] as [...] "a mark of special esteem" [...] for particularly experienced camp administrators. The term is still found in use in Russia today (for example, President Vladimir Putin {{has been referred to}} in the Russian media as a [...] "chekist" [...] due to his career in <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> and as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB's</b> successor, FSB).|$|R
50|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Semichastny was {{responsible}} for coordinating all information received from abroad. His chosen crisis team oversaw intelligence from the Foreign Ministry, the GRU (Military Intelligence) and, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b> <b>The</b> team met every day {{in his office at}} KGB Headquarters in Lubyanka Square.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, <b>KGB</b> {{defector}} Vasili Mitrokhin and {{two former}} members of East Germany's secret police revealed that Segal was a Soviet disinformation agent who worked for <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bond and Tibbett {{travel to}} Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled {{by a woman}} who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for $5million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's {{laboratory}} and learn that he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in the horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and believes that his attempt to assassinate Bond has been successful. Afterwards, General Gogol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission and reveals that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him—and the potential investors—a monopoly over the microchip industry.|$|E
5|$|In east–west relations, Douglas-Home {{continued}} his policy {{of keeping the}} Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB,</b> would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E
500|$|After {{his return}} to Moscow, Fisher was {{employed}} by <b>the</b> Illegals Directorate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB's</b> First Chief Directorate, giving speeches and lecturing school children on intelligence work, but became increasingly disillusioned. He made a notable appearance in the foreword to the Soviet spy film Dead Season and also worked as a consultant on the film. Fisher, who was a heavy smoker, {{died of lung cancer}} on 15 November 1971. His ashes were interred at the Donskoy Cemetery under his real name, and a few Western correspondents were invited there to view for themselves <b>the</b> true identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spy who never [...] "broke".|$|R

25|$|After {{the failed}} August 1991 putsch, Primakov was {{appointed}} First Deputy Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> and Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> First Chief Directorate responsible for foreign intelligence. After {{the formation of}} the Russian Federation, Primakov shepherded the transition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> First Chief Directorate to the control of the Russian Federation government, under the new name Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Primakov preserved the old KGB foreign intelligence apparatus under the new SVR label, and led no personnel purges or structural reforms. He served as SVR director from 1991 until 1996.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{documents}} of the archive are letters from the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> to the Central Committee about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers. The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 (Brezhnev stagnation). The documents characterize not only Sakharov's activity, but that of other dissidents, {{as well as that}} of highest-position apparatchiks and the KGB. No Russian equivalent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> archive is available.|$|E
5|$|The now {{available}} evidence supports {{the conclusion that}} <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> to rid <b>the</b> USSR <b>of</b> undesirable elements. According to several available documents and a message by a former general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth (dissident) Directorate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>KGB</b> to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.|$|R
