40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} newly {{formulated}} enterotoxaemia vaccine having oil and alum adjuvants, with presently available toxoid and alum precipitated vaccines. Materials and Methods: Three types of enterotoxaemia vaccines, namely toxoid (TV), alum precipitated (APV) and alum <b>precipitated</b> <b>oil</b> adjuvant vaccine (AOV) were prepared using a highly toxigenic strain of Clostridium perfringens type D procured from Division of Biological Standardization, IVRI, Izatnagar. Humoral immunity generated in rabbits with these vaccines was then quantified using indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and mice neutralization test (MNT). Results: Out of three enterotoxaemia vaccines tested, alum <b>precipitated</b> <b>oil</b> adjuvant vaccine produced higher and persistent antibody titre for more than 45 days without any booster dose and did not produce any untoward reactions at the injection site. Alum precipitated vaccine elicited better and persistent immune response than toxoid vaccine though it was less than alum <b>precipitated</b> <b>oil</b> adjuvant vaccine. In MNT, alum precipitated and alum <b>precipitated</b> <b>oil</b> adjuvant vaccines showed protection at 45 th day of post vaccination while toxoid vaccine showed only up to 28 th day. Conclusion: Results of the study unfolded the synergistic role of adjuvants in the induction of better and persistent immune response and also indicated the superiority of alum <b>precipitated</b> <b>oil</b> adjuvant vaccine over the currently available toxoid and alum precipitated enterotoxaemia vaccines.

30|$|Because of {{the complex}} nature of oil mixture, its {{elemental}} examination is difficult. One of the best approaches to describe an oil mixture is SARA separation which is an analytical approach to categorize oil into four fractions based on their polarity as saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes (Aske et al. 2001; Aske 2002; Fan and Buckley 2002; Goel et al. 2017). Asphaltene is the polyaromatic fraction of the crude oil {{with a wide range}} for molecular mass reported in the literature, to name a few, from 700 to 40, 000 (Ratovskaya 1968), 1000 – 50, 000  g/mol (Ali and Al-Ghannam 1981), 3200 [*]±[*] 400  g/mol (Acevedo et al. 2005 b) and 300 – 1400  g/mol (Akbarzadeh et al. 2007). However, the latest, and more probable value, was reported by Mullins et al. (2012) to be around 750  g/mol. Another approach to define asphaltenes is through solubility aspects; asphaltene is defined as the fraction of <b>oil</b> which <b>precipitates</b> upon mixing of oil sample with normal alkanes as pentane, hexane and heptane (Andersen 1994; Arya et al. 2015; Mozaffari et al. 2015). It was found that different alkanes (as the precipitants) result in various amounts of asphaltene precipitation for the same oil sample. The lighter precipitant results in greater mass of asphaltene precipitation (Kokal and Sayegh 1995; Hu and Guo 2001). In some publications, asphaltene solubility in aromatic solvents such as toluene and benzene is also considered when “solubility” of the particulates is considered for classification (Speight and Moschopedis 1981; Kawanaka et al. 1991; Browarzik et al. 1999; Speight 2004; Akbarzadeh et al. 2007; Mozaffari et al. 2017). As stated, several classification criteria were proposed in the literature (including molecular mass, molecular structure, solubility, etc.) to define asphaltenes; however, there is no universal and standard definition for this fraction of the crude oil. Another interesting point about structure of asphaltenes is the presence of significant amounts of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur (Speight 2004; Aquino-Olivos et al. 2013; Guzmán et al. 2017). In addition, asphaltenes contain some amounts of metals such as Ni, Fe, and V (Leontaritis 1996; Luo et al. 2010; Maqbool et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} rapid method to {{determine}} the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of crude oils with injected fluids such as CO 2, natural gas hydrocarbons, and mixtures of different fluids was developed based on determining the pressure at which the interfacial tension between the injected fluid and crude oil phases decreases to zero. The height of a column of oil in capillary tubes suspended {{in a pool of}} crude oil is measured at different pressures of the injected fluid, and linear pressure versus height plots are extrapolated to zero height {{to determine the}} MMP value. Replicate MMP determinations show good reproducibility, with relative standard deviation (RSD) values less than 5 %. The method has been used to investigate the effect of reservoir conditions on MMP, such as reservoir temperature (increasing the temperature greatly increases the MMP), the presence of natural gas components on CO 2 MMP (e. g., MMP is raised with increasing amounts of methane), to comparing MMP values with different injected fluids such as pure CO 2, and methane. Video recordings of the MMP determinations showed that significant oil mobilization into the injected fluid occurs even below MMP, and additional oil is mobilized as the pressure is increased above MMP. Similarly, significant <b>oil</b> is <b>precipitated</b> as the pressure is decreased from above MMP to the MMP and pressures below MMP. To confirm these visual observations, the oil suspended in the upper injected fluid (e. g., CO 2) was collected at pressure, and analyzed to determine the mass of mobilized oil as well as the molecular weight distribution of the hydrocarbons in the injected fluid (upper) phase. These analyses demonstrated that increasing the pressure above the MMP (e. g., to 2300 psi for an oil with an MMP of 1450 psi) can double the amount of hydrocarbons mobilized into the injected phase. Similarly, when the pressure is dropped, significant precipitation of mobilized hydrocarbons occurs even though the pressure is still above MMP. Lower molecular weight hydrocarbons are preferentially mobilized at all pressures, but especially at lower pressures, indicating that higher molecular weight hydrocarbons could largely remain in the reservoir during EOR floods...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{economic}} crisis of late 2008, Vladimir Putin’s political regime ensured the election of Dmitry Medvedev {{to the office of}} the presidency while Putin shifted to the role of prime minister—a move intended to solidify the Putin administration’s hold over the Kremlin. Supposedly, the Medvedev-Putin alliance sought to modernize the raw-materials-based economy in an attempt to improve its level of vulnerability. However, the fall of <b>oil</b> prices has <b>precipitated</b> disastrous consequences on Russia’s economy, and, as a result, the stability of the Medvedev-Putin regime has faltered. It is now unclear what the power dynamic between Medvedev and Putin will be, and if Putin will continue to maintain his dominant position in Russian politics. Much of the reason for the current regime’s grip on power is the general dissatisfaction with the reforms of the early 1990. This recent return to a bureaucratic economic system and a political system headed by an autocratic-style leader begat a period of prosperity and renewed the dream of regaining the geopolitical status Russia had during the Soviet period. At the present, Russia is ill-equipped to handle many of the challenges wrought by {{the economic}} crisis, and the ruling elite has lost many of its financial resources and public support. It is still unclear whether the current regime will survive the challenges it currently faces. Although there exists a possibility for an alternative, liberal governing model to emerge, it is equally possible that the Putin government will find a way to uphold the status quo. This is a profoundly uncertain period in Russia’s political development...|$|R
40|$|Asphaltene {{precipitation}} {{is one of}} {{the serious}} problems during the secondary and tertiary oil recovery in light oil reservoirs using carbon dioxide injection. Asphaltene precipitation leads to significant problem in production system such as wellbore plugging, permeability reduction and porosity alteration. In this work, light crude oil was chosen to predict the effect of carbon dioxide injection and its interaction with oil. Saturate aromatic, resin and asphaltene (SARA) analysis was conducted to know the propensity of the light crude <b>oil</b> to <b>precipitate.</b> Later, the laboratory study was conducted to analyse the behaviour of asphaltene and carbon dioxide with different gas oil ratios (GOR). Different pressure volume temperature (PVT) experiments were conducted to know the asphaltene precipitation behaviour. The results from the PVT test showed that asphaltene precipitation was found significant at GOR 310 scf/st and the bubble point pressure of 2100 Psig. Dynamic core flooding study with various carbon dioxide concentrations and flow rates were conducted to measure asphaltene precipitation induced by carbon dioxide. Before running the core flooding, the minimum miscibility pressure was determined and it was found to be 1500 Psi. Three Berea sandstone cores were used as formation reservoir to determine the asphaltene precipitation and to study the effect of carbon dioxide injection. The parameters for three cores were kept constant at the pressure of 2000 Psi and temperature of 100 °C while varying the injection flow rates. The three flow rates of 0. 4 cc/min, 0. 6 cc/min and 0. 8 cc/min were set for three core flooding runs, i. e. Core 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As the pore volume of gas injected increased, there was a decreased in the asphaltene content in the recovered oil and thus the amount of asphaltene recovered in the core is increased. At pore volume 1. 00 cc, the asphaltene precipitation from the dynamic core flooding tests for Core 1, 2 and 3 were found to be 0. 13 % wt, 0. 18 % wt, and 0. 19 % wt respectively. From the study, it was found that at higher pore volume of gas injected, it will lead to more asphaltene precipitation in the core and lesser amount of asphaltene inside the oil recovered. It can be concluded that high injection of pore volume fluid in the sample core can change the resin, asphaltene ratio and precipitate higher amount of asphaltene particles. The injection flow rate of 0. 8 cc/min showed the highest amount of asphaltene precipitated in the core...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  4 that the {{activation}} energies are different in various temperature intervals for the same oil sample, and the activation energy at low temperatures is higher than that at high temperatures. There are several reasons contributing to the increase in the activation energy at low temperatures. (1) During the cooling process, the degree of the thermal motion of particles is weakened and the solubility of resin in heavy oil reduces, resulting in resin molecules continuously <b>precipitating</b> from crude <b>oil.</b> These can absorb and aggregate on the surfaces of asphaltene particles to form a solvent layer of varying thickness (Ye et al. 2010). This adsorption effect becomes significant as well as an increase in the solvent layer at lower temperatures. The aggregated asphaltene adsorbs the solvent layer during the cooling process, resulting in increases in the micelle volume and the interaction force. (2) At low temperatures, with an increase in the volume of resin–asphaltene aggregations, the distance between micelles is reduced. Adjacent micelles may be connected with each other through the action of hydrogen bonds and coordinative bonds to form a spatial network structure and to wrap a lot of liquid oil in it (Zhu et al. 2011, 2012). (3) A small amount of paraffin contained in crude <b>oil</b> crystallizes and <b>precipitates</b> at low temperatures, and interacts with resin and asphaltene in the precipitation process, giving the heavy oil significant structural strength at low temperatures. All of these lead to a rapid increase in viscosity at low temperatures, and this is why the logη versus  1 /T curve has greater deviation upward at low temperatures. Hence, it is crucial for production of heavy crude oil to maintain the reservoir at relatively high temperatures if possible.|$|R
40|$|Asphaltenes are the {{heaviest}} fraction of crude <b>oil</b> and can <b>precipitate</b> due {{to changes in}} temperature, pressure or composition. It was previously shown that the precipitation and aggregation of asphaltenes is a kinetic phenomenon. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that the kinetics of aggregation is universal among many different crude oils, model oils and precipitants. The factors that {{can play a role}} in controlling this kinetic behavior are investigated in this study. It is shown that the rate of asphaltene aggregation strongly depends on the type of solvent (i. e. crude oil) used for stabilizing asphaltenes. A new universal mathematical model relating the aggregation rate to the solution viscosity and the solubility parameters of the solution and asphaltenes is developed. With this model, all aggregation curves collapse onto a single master curve. The asphaltene content and the chemical identity of the precipitant are also shown to play important roles in controlling the aggregation rates. The findings for the effect of asphaltene content challenge the intuitive expectation that higher asphaltene concentration would lead to accelerated aggregation kinetics. Instead, two distinct regimes are identified for the effect of asphaltene concentration: 1) Below 1 wt%, the aggregation rate of asphaltenes increases, 2) Above 1 wt%, the aggregation rate decreases. The new universal model successfully predicts this behavior after accounting for the contribution of soluble asphaltenes to the solubility parameter of the solution. In addition, the polydispersity of asphaltenes is shown to be important in dictating their kinetic behavior in different n-alkane precipitants. The universal model quantitatively accounts for the asphaltenes polydispersity using a solubility parameter distribution and can successfully predict the precipitation rate of asphaltenes in the blends of up to five different precipitants. Finally, our findings reveal that asphaltenes with the highest solubility paramenter precipitate first and have the tendency to form the largest nano-particles in toluene. The findings from this thesis leads {{to a better understanding of}} the factors that govern the kinetics and can in turn give rise to new predictive models to foresee precipitation and aggregation kinetics under different operational conditions...|$|R
