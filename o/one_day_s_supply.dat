Naturally coloured aposematic larveae of Pyrrhocoris apterus have been compared to two types of prey: 1) to identically coloured but in defensive secretion different larvae of Scantius aegyptius, and 2) differently coloured larvae of white mutants of P. apterus. The defensive secretion of S. aegyptius has been found less effective in the first interaction with predator than that of P. apterus, however, after several trials the difference of reactions of the spider has not been noticeable. When changed the species of prey, E. arcuata has symmetrically and considerably generalised between the two species. Significant difference {{has been established in}} memory test - while P. apterus has been avoided even after <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>S.</b> aegyptius has been attacked as thought the spiders were naive. The learning sequence has been similar in both colour forms of P. apterus; the generalisation of the two colours has been symetrical as well. Both colour forms succeeded in memory test (e. g. spiders have proven difference in comparison with the naive ones), however, white mutants have been successfully attacked [...] ...|$|R

The plants were irrigated with water of low (S 1 = 0. 61 dS m- 1) and high (S 2 = 4. 78 dS m- 1) salinity levels, during each crop stage: S 1 S 1 S 2 S 2 - T 1; S 2 S 1 S 2 S 2 - T 2; S 2 S 2 S 1 S 2 - T 3. The 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th terms of these sequences correspond to initial growth, flowering, fruit ripening and harvest phenological stages, respectively. Additionally, there was irrigation rotation during all cycle, with water S 1 during two <b>days</b> followed by <b>S</b> 2 for <b>one</b> <b>day</b> (<b>S</b> 1 2 dias + S 2 1 dia - T 4) and irrigation with non-salt water S 2 during all cycle - T 5.

40|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML), {{a very rare}} type of cancer, {{generally}} affects patients over 50 years old. While clinical drugs to treat advanced stages of AML exist, the disease becomes increasingly resistant to therapies. Euphorbia formosana Hayata (EF) is a native Taiwanese medicinal plant used to treat rheumatism, liver cirrhosis, herpes zoster, scabies, and photoaging, along with tumor suppression. However, the mechanisms by which it suppresses tumors have not been explored. Here, we provide molecular evidence that a hot-water extract of Euphorbia formosana (EFW) selectively inhibited the growth of human leukemic cancer cells more than other solid human cancer cell lines. Most importantly, the plant extract had limited toxicity toward healthy {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). After THP- 1 leukemic cells were treated with 50 – 100 µg/mL EFW for <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> the <b>S</b> phase DNA content of the cells increased, while treatment with 200 – 400 µg/mL caused the cells to accumulate in the G 0 /G 1 phase. Notably, EFW did not affect A- 549 lung cancer cells. The effectiveness of EFW against THP- 1 cells may be through caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells, which is mediated through the Fas and mitochondrial pathways. The potent antileukemic activity of EFW in vitro warrants further investigation of this plant to treat leukemias and other malignancies...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} lead and sulfur accumulation in paddy soils in parts of southern China. A combined soil sand pot experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> on iron plaque formation and Pb accumulation in rice (Oryza saliva L.) under two Pb levels (0 and 600 mg kg(- 1)), combined with four S concentrations (0, 30, 60, and 120 mg kg(- 1)). Results showed that <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> significantly decreased Pb accumulation in straw and grains of rice. This result {{may be attributed to}} the enhancement of Fe plaque formation, decrease of Pb availability in soil, and increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) in rice leaves. Moderate <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> (30 mg kg(- 1)) significantly increased Fe plaque formation on the root surface and in the rhizosphere, whereas excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> (60 and 120 mg kg(- 1)) significantly decreased the amounts of iron plaque on the root surface. Sulfur supply significantly enhanced the GSH contents in leaves of rice plants under Pb treatment. With excessive S application, the rice root acted as a more effective barrier to Pb accumulation compared with iron plaque. Excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> may result in a higher monosulfide toxicity and decreased iron plaque formation on the root surface during flooded conditions. However, excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> could effectively decrease Pb availability in soils and reduce Pb accumulation in rice plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{breeding}} {{process can}} be facilitated if sulfur efficiency in canola at maturity can be reliably determined by screening germplasm in the vegetative stage. Twelve canola genotypes chosen fromapreliminary screening studywith either high or lowSefficiency indiceswere tested for consistency inS efficiencybetweenvegetative stage andmaturity. Plantswere grown under glasshouse conditions using low or adequate <b>S</b> <b>supply.</b> The criteria for efficiency assessment at the vegetative stage were: shoot biomass at deficient <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> relative biomass production, and S utilisation efficiency. Considering these three criteria of S efficiency, only one canola genotype was classified as efficient (Surpass 402 CL). Three genotypes were classified as inefficient under two criteria: genotypes IB 1337 and Surpass 300 TT for relative biomass production at low <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> and S-utilisation efficiency, and IB 1368 for biomass production and relative biomass production. In addition to seed yield, relative seed yield, and S utilisation, four additional efficiency criteria were used for thematurity stage: harvest index, S harvest index, and oil and protein concentrations in the seed. For all efficiency criteria used, highly significant genotypic differences existed. IB 1368 was ranked efficient under all criteria. Genotypes Surpass 402 CL and 46 C 74 were ranked inefficient atmaturity but efficient at the vegetative stage. In conclusion, screening canola germplasm for S efficiency requires {{an assessment of the}} efficiency at maturity rather than during vegetative growth...|$|R

HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE is supplied as a crystalline solid. A stock solution may be made by dissolving the HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE in an organic solvent purged with an inert gas. HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE is soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol, DMSO, and dimethyl formamide. The solubility of HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE in these solvents is approximately 20 mg/ml. HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE is sparingly soluble in aqueous buffers. For maximum solubility in aqueous buffers, HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE should first be dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with the aqueous buffer of choice. HMB-Val-Ser-Leu-VE has a solubility of approximately 0. 5 mg/ml in a 1 : 10 solution of ethanol:PBS (pH 7. 2) using this method. We do not recommend storing the aqueous solution for more than <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> The 20 <b>S</b> proteasome is a 700 kDa, multi-subunit cylinder-shaped protein that functions as the central protease within the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway utilized by cells for the regulated degradation of proteins. 1, 2 HMB-val-ser-leu-VE is a tripeptide bearing a C-terminal vinyl ester which acts as a potent, selective inhibitor of the trypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome.

The aim of this work was to characterize the strategies adopted by plants to cope with both Fe deficiency (release of phytosiderophores) and Cd contamination [production of glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins] when grown under conditions of limited <b>S</b> <b>supply.</b> Experiments were performed in hydroponics, using barley plants grown under S sufficiency (1. 2 mM sulphate) and S deficiency (0 mM sulphate), with or without Fe III-EDTA at 0. 08 mM for 11 d and subsequently exposed to 0. 05 mM Cd for 24 h or 72 h. In S-sufficient plants, Fe deficiency enhanced both root and shoot Cd concentrations and increased GSH and phytochelatin levels. In S-deficient plants, Fe starvation caused {{a slight increase in}} Cd concentration, but this change was accompanied neither by an increase in GSH nor by an accumulation of phytochelatins. Release of phytosiderophores, only detectable in Fe-deficient plants, was strongly decreased by S deficiency and further reduced after Cd treatment. In roots Cd exposure increased the expression of the high affinity sulphate transporter gene (HvST 1) regardless of the <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> and the expression of the Fe deficiency-responsive genes, HvYS 1 and HvIDS 2, irrespective of Fe supply. In conclusion, adequate S availability is necessary to cope with Fe deficiency and Cd toxicity in barley plants. Moreover, it appears that in Fe-deficient plants grown in the presence of Cd with limited <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> sulphur may be preferentially employed in the pathway for biosynthesis of phytosiderophores, rather than for phytochelatin production...|$|R
