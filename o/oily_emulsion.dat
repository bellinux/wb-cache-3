40|$|A {{detailed}} study of Seabra's lipasic reagent for the diagnostic of tuberculosis has been made. Substrate. The <b>oily</b> <b>emulsion</b> of cotton seed oil containing gum as dispersing agent, presented a pH variation to the ampoulles examined. In these belonging to the same cartoon {{as well as in}} those from different cartoons the values obtained electrometrically ranged from pH 5. 8 - 6. 4 (Table I). These variations lead us to presuppose: 1) instability of the <b>oily</b> <b>emulsion</b> in gum; 2) spontaneous hydrolysis of the oil; 3) different batches or technique of the oil extraction, or different sources. Buffer: The same variability observed with substrate was found for the buffer. In CHERRY & CRANDALL's method the buffer is pH 7. 0. The saline solution from Seabra's oscillated from pH 6. 25 - 6. 9 (table II). Titration - end point. A colorimetric comparison between the sample and the blank as suggested by Seabra becomes very difficult. The end point in the presence of serum, when phenolphtalein is used as indicator, is very difficult to compare with the blank containing water. Conclusion. The differences observed in the results when the same serum was used, must be due to the variations observed with Seabra's reagents...|$|E
30|$|It {{is known}} that {{interfacial}} tension is decreased due to the adsorption of surfactants at the interface of liquids with the polar end in water and the hydrocarbon chain in the oil. Thus, the lower the interfacial tension, the better the oil mobility and, consequently, the better its efficiency in the destabilization process of <b>oily</b> <b>emulsions</b> (Santos et al. 2016). All biosurfactants presented similar interfacial tensions from a statistical point of view, with a slight highlight for the biosurfactants from C. sphaerica, C. lipolytica (a) and P. aeruginosa, which presented values below 13  mN/m. Since the demulsification percentages varied between the biosurfactants, the interfacial tension values {{do not appear to}} contribute to the demulsifying capability and therefore may not be a key factor for the ability of the biosurfactants to act as demulsifiers.|$|R
40|$|Ultrafiltration of {{emulsified}} oil {{in water}} wastestreams from waste cutting and grinding operations, waste rolling oil solutions, and alkaline degreasing baths can produce an effluent water phase that is acceptable for discharge to sewer systems. Since ultrafiltration membranes {{act as a}} physical barrier between the wastestream and the clean water effluent, operator or flow caused upsets are prevented, ensuring no carryover of oil to the effluent. The effluent (permeate) from the ultrafiltration system is usually of sufficient quality for discharge to a sanitary sewer system. The permeate, as a rule, contains less than 100 mgll of freon-extractable oil and grease and less than 10 mgll suspended solids. The ultrafiltration process also produces a liquid oil concentrate containing up to 60 % oil and solids, which can be disposed of by hauling or incineration. The concentrate will be only 3. 5 % of the original volume. No sludge containing large amounts of chemicals and heavy metals is produced in ultrafiltration because no such chemicals are required as in other methods of treating <b>oily</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Ultrafiltration {{has been found to}} be the most costeffective treatment method for treatment of oillwater emulsions in many applications...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{functionalization}} of polymers {{after the}} synthesis of membranes has great importance for various applications separative processes of industrial or environmental interest. Polysulfone (PSf) {{is one of the}} most applied polymers for separative processes used especially in membrane technology, due to its excellent chemical, mechanical and thermal properties. The functionalization of PSf makes it very attractive to give special characteristics due to their high hydrophobicity and membrane fouling fast. In this work PSf perform functionalization by the method of Friedel-Crafts with choroethyl chloroacetate and subsequent hydrolysis of chloroetyl group (-OH). After synthesizing the membrane is characterized by FT-IR ATR spectroscopy, 1 HNMR, contact angle measurements, retention of polydisperse solutes and hydraulic permeability. Finally, the membranes tests fouling are performed with an <b>oily</b> wastewater <b>emulsion.</b> The fouling tests showed that the functionalized PSf membrane demonstrated significant anti-fouling property, suggesting the remarkable benefit for long-term operation in practical applications. Specifically, all the functionalized membranes reached almost 60 % water flux recovery and were able to maintain the constant initial fluxes in filtration test, whereas the raw membrane only recovered 70. 27 % and suffered continuous decline. This promotion might be related to the increase of membrane surface hydrophilicity. Fil: Masuelli, Martin Alberto. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

40|$|Abstract—The {{coalescer}} {{process is}} one of the methods for oily water treatment by increasing the oil droplet size in order to enhance the separating velocity and thus effective separation. However, the presence of surfactants in an <b>oily</b> <b>emulsion</b> can limit the obtained mechanisms due to the small oil size related with stabilized emulsion. In this regard, the purpose of this research is to improve the efficiency of the coalescer process for treating the stabilized emulsion. The effects of bed types, bed height, liquid flow rate and stage coalescer (step-bed) on the treatment efficiencies in term of COD values were studied. Note that the treatment efficiency obtained experimentally was estimated by using the COD values and oil droplet size distribution. The study has shown that the plastic media has more effective to attach with oil particles than the stainless one due to their hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, the suitable bed height (3. 5 cm) and step bed (3. 5 cm with 2 steps) were necessary in order to well obtain the coalescer performance. The application of step bed coalescer process in reactor has provided the higher treatment efficiencies in term of COD removal than those obtained with classical process. The proposed model for predicting the area under curve and thus treatment efficiency, based on the single collector efficiency (ηT) and the attachment efficiency (α), provides relatively a good coincidence between the experimental and predicted values of treatment efficiencies in this study.

40|$|A poluição hídrica evoluiu e ainda evolui através dos anos com o crescimento e o desenvolvimento do setor {{industrial}}. O petróleo e seus derivados são classificados entre os principais poluentes dos ambientes aquáticos. Na medida em que ocorre o crescimento econômico e o aumento da atividade industrial no mundo, cresce também o consumo dos derivados de petróleo, e conseqüentemente, a geração de efluentes líquidos contaminados com óleos lubrificantes. Estes efluentes, resultantes de várias modalidades de processos industriais atuais, caracterizam-se por sua alta carga orgânica (DQO) e baixa biodegradabilidade devido à presença de diversas substâncias orgânicas. Muitas vezes o tratamento físico químico convencional (coagulação / floculação) não é suficiente para reduzir a carga orgânica destes efluentes aos níveis permitidos por leis. Desta forma, torna-se importante o uso de técnicas alternativas para o tratamento destes efluentes. Este trabalho objetivou desenvolver uma rota processual para o tratamento de um efluente contaminado com óleo lubrificante, utilizando os Processos Oxidativos Avançados com aplicação do Reagente de Fenton. Esta rota deve ser viável, técnica e economicamente, para ser implantada na indústria, reduzindo com maior eficácia a carga orgânica desse tipo de efluente líquido. Utilizou-se, nos experimentos conduzidos, um efluente de bancada, de composição padronizada, que pudesse representar um efluente industrial típico contaminado com óleos lubrificantes emulsionáveis. Os resultados preliminares indicaram que o tratamento com aplicação direta do reagente de Fenton sobre o efluente não é eficaz, uma vez que não há sequer a quebra da emulsão oleosa. Com base nestes experimentos, propôs-se então uma técnica conjugada, consistindo da seguinte rota: o tratamento convencional iniciando com a quebra da emulsão; o tratamento com reagente de Fenton e uma etapa final envolvendo a floculação. Testou-se esta proposta em um novo conjunto de experimentos, os quais mostraram que essa rota processual de técnicas conjugadas apresenta melhores resultados do que aqueles obtidos no tratamento físico químico convencional. A faixa operacional, recomendada para a obtenção de valores de DQO dentro do limite da norma Técnica T 187. 2 da COPASA (DQO < 450 mg/L), é assim especificada: 750 a 1. 250 mg/L para a concentração de peróxido de hidrogênio; 300 a 500 mg/L para a concentração de ferro e 120 a 240 minutos para o tempo de reação. Uma análise de custos para operacionalizar essa rota na indústria foi realizada, visando comparar estes custos aos do tratamento atual utilizado. A comparação desses custos comprovou a viabilidade de se implementar a nova rota na indústria, uma vez que a diferença entre esses custos não foi significante. Entretanto, como mostrado, o fator limitante da implementação desta nova rota na indústria é o tempo de tratamento do efluente, o qual é aumentado em torno de 01 hora quando comparado ao tempo do tratamento convencional. Para a empresa analisada neste trabalho, este aumento no tempo de tratamento acarreta em utilizar plenamente a capacidade máxima da estação de tratamento de efluente da indústria. The {{water pollution}} has increased along all these years, but meanly {{during the last}} years with the growth {{and development of the}} industrial sector. The oil and its derivatives are classified among the main pollutants of the aquatic environment. As the economy and the industrial activities grow in the world, the consumption of the oil and its derivatives enlarges, generating a large increase in the oil contaminated wastewater. This type of wastewater is characterized by its high organic load (COD) and low biodegradability due to the presence of different organic compounds. The physicochemical treatment of these wastewaters (coagulation/flocculation), used conventionally in industries, is not enough to reduce the organic load in these effluents to a level allowed by the specific legislation. Then, the use of alternative techniques for treating these wastewaters becomes important. This work has aimed for developing a process route to perform the treatment of these oil contaminated wastewaters, by using of Advanced Oxidative Processes through the application of Fentons Reagent. This route should be feasible, economically and technically, to be incorporated into any industrial process, for reducing efficaciously the organic load (Chemical Oxygen Demand) in this effluent type. Experiments performed in this work have been used a standard oil contaminated wastewater, made in laboratory, with its chemical composition defined and controlled to well represent a tipic industrial wastewater contaminated with emulsified oils. Preliminary results have shown that the application of Fentons reagent directly on this effluent is not efficient, since the <b>oily</b> <b>emulsion</b> breakage cannot be even reached. Based on these results, a conjugate technique has been proposed, consisting of the following route: the conventional treatment beginning with the oil emulsion breakage; the treatment with Fentons reagent and a final step involving flocculation. This proposal was tested performing a new set of experiments, which have confirmed that this route of combined techniques presents better results than those obtained in the conventional physicochemical treatment. The operational range, recommended for obtaining the COD value within the limit allowed by the technical norm T 187. 2 from COPASA (COD < 450 mg/L), is specified as: 750 to 1. 250 mg/L for the hydrogen peroxide concentration; 300 to 500 mg/L for the iron concentration and 120 e 240 minutes for the reaction time. An analysis of costs required to operate industrially this new route was performed for comparing to the costs expend in the conventional treatment of this wastewater. This comparison confirmed the feasibility of implement this new route into the industry, since difference between these two costs was not significant. However, as shown, the restricted variable for implementing this new route in any industry is, in fact, the reaction time, which increases in one hour the time of the conventional treatment. For the industry analyzed in this work, the time increase in the treatment implies in operating the effluent treatment work station at its maximum capacity...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{extraction}} {{and processing}} operations in Romania {{have resulted in}} the production of large volumes of oily sludge, which constitute a severe pollution problem for this industry. The oily sludge contains crude oil (10 - 60 %), water (30 - 90 %) and petroleum solid particles (5 - 40 %) in various proportions depending on its origin. These <b>oily</b> sludges are <b>emulsions</b> of either oil-in-water or water-in-oil type, with relative stability determined by the presence of mineral particles along with the oil and reservoir water. Previous investigations of our research group have selected several bacterial consortia with high efficiency for hydrocarbon degradation. This paper presents the results of the studies regarding the degradation of sludge hydrocarbons by selected bacterial consortia. The bioremediation studies were conducted at Potlogi Oil Field, Dambovita County (Southern Romania). The experiments were carried out in field plots with and without addition of a special selected bacterial inoculum. Before addition of the inoculum, the sludge-contaminated soil was mixed with coarse sand and chopped hay in all experimental parcels except controls. These bulking agents increase the permeability and porosity of oily sludge, improving bacterial accessibility to hydrocarbons. A nutrient solution was added to all parcels to stimulate naturally occurring microbiota. Hydrocarbon concentrations in soil samples as well a...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using hydrochloric acid (HCl), heat, dilution and magnetic stirring for the pre-treatment of palm oil mill Effluent (POME) before the primary anaerobic treatment {{was investigated in}} this study. The theoretical background of <b>oily</b> water <b>emulsion</b> which is the characteristic of POME was reviewed. A range of experiments was performed on samples made up of different combinations {{of the three major}} components of POME namely, palm oil, solid from decanter and water. The results suggest that the development of a pre-treatment system to remove the 0. 5 - 1. 2 % residue oil and 3 - 4 % solid matter from the fresh POME is feasible thus it could improve the efficiency of further downstream POME treatment. Experiments were conducted to examine the rate of oil flotation from the mixtures of different ratios of palm oil and water treated with different concentrations of HCl, and temperatures and magnetic stirring. Similarly, a series of experiments were performed to determine the rate of solid settlement from palm oil-solid mixture, solid-water mixture and palm oil-solid-water mixture of different ratios treated with different concentrations of HCl and different temperatures. The data obtained from the experiments were used to determine the optimum dosage of HCl used and the temperature required for best oil recovery and solid settlement. From the kinetic studies, the models of the kinetic rate of palm oil flotation and solid settlement were derived. A macro kinetic modeling was adapted to the oil flotation while a power model was used for solid settling. The results showed that treatment with 0. 5 % HCl was sufficient to increase the rate of oil flotation significantly in Palm oil-water mixture. However, the effect was dependent on the oil-water ratio. An increase in temperature gave higher rate of oil flotation but not as great as that of HCl treatment. Dilution was found to be the two other factors that affected the rate of flotation. The solid settling rates in all tested samples were not significantly affected when they were treated with HCl. The rate of solid settlement was found to be temperature dependent. The optimum temperature for the rate of solid sedimentation was found to be in the region of 800 C. Similar positive effect was also observed for a more diluted sample of Solid-Palm oil-Water mixture...|$|R
