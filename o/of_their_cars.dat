5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW confirmed that they would be running the same specification of engine introduced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive-in}} {{theater is}} a form of cinema structure consisting of a large outdoor movie screen, a projection booth, a concession stand and a large parking area for automobiles, where patrons view the movie from the comfort <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> and listen via an electric speaker placed at each parking spot.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2008, Aoshima Bunka Kyozai {{launched}} [...] "ITASHA" [...] as one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> model <b>car</b> product lines. Since then, many model {{companies have}} produced various itasha versions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> models. Fujimi, Kyosho, HPI and Tamiya also sell models with itasha decorations.|$|R

5|$|Following the French Grand Prix on 2 July, six teams {{conducted}} testing {{sessions at}} the Silverstone Circuit between 4–6 July {{to prepare for}} the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring. Frentzen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing, ahead of Sauber's Pedro Diniz. Alexander Wurz's car was afflicted with an gearbox issue, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen for Arrows was quickest on the final day of testing, although his car's front wing was damaged when his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Ferrari and McLaren opted to test at the Mugello Circuit where both teams concentrated their efforts on aerodynamic and suspension set-ups between 4–7 July. Ferrari spent one further day performing shakedown runs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Autódromo do Estoril between 5–7 July where testing consisted of tyre, engine, aerodynamic and set-up optimisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{season was}} preceded by three test {{sessions}}; one at Jerez de la Frontera and two in Barcelona. These sessions gave the teams and drivers the opportunity to familiarise themselves with their cars, though the teams downplayed the accuracy of testing times as being representative of the running order for the season. At the second test in Barcelona, Lotus F1 discovered a critical fault in the build of their chassis that forced them to miss four days of running, while both HRT and Marussia were unable to complete any mileage with their 2012 cars after both the HRT F112 and Marussia MR01 failed their crash tests, though both teams were able to complete shakedowns <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{the race}} both McLaren drivers told {{the media that}} there was work to be done, {{particularly}} improvements in the aerodynamics <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R

5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via radio and the race was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five minutes until the marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the excess water and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars,</b> which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E
5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both drivers for another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that none <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the restart at the beginning of lap 58, Bottas made a move on Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 the Lanchester Motor Company at Sparkbrook was {{acquired}} and production <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> transferred to Daimler's Coventry works. The first new product was {{a version of}} the Daimler Light Twenty or 16/20 and called Lanchester 15/18.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Cosworth DFV in , F1 constructors found the exceptional power-to-weight ratio of the new engine gave them much more power than the grip levels <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> could deal with, particularly in wet conditions. As a result several solutions were tried, with three leading Cosworth customers and even Cosworth themselves each trying their hand at building 4WD F1 cars.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, the U.S. {{automakers}} were commissioning models <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> from suppliers {{that included}} AMT and Jo-Han. Automobile sales people realized that, as one slogan {{of the time}} put it, “the little ones sell the big ones”. The promise of a free toy car for the kids would entice families into showrooms to view the latest car designs and take them for test drives.|$|E

However, as soon as they’re allowed, they go after the plane Shaw is planning to take off on with Mia. Gisele and Han are one of two teams designated with the task of keeping the plane on the ground using the harpoons. During their efforts, Gisele is pulled out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> by Adolfson. Han follows after her, climbing onto the top <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R

Vehicles that carry a green plate at the front <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> are able to carry passengers across the Victoria Harbour to Kowloon. There are, however, areas with restricted kerbs and designated pick-up and drop-off points in the area.|$|E
25|$|After public protests by EV drivers' groups {{upset by}} the {{repossession}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars,</b> Toyota offered the last 328 RAV4-EVs for sale {{to the general public}} during six months, up until 22 November 2002. Almost all other production electric cars were withdrawn from the market and were in some cases seen to have been destroyed by their manufacturers. Toyota continues to support the several hundred Toyota RAV4-EV {{in the hands of the}} general public and in fleet usage. GM famously de-activated the few EV1s that were donated to engineering schools and museums.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for {{speeding}} more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not the color <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed {{that the number of}} speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars was about the same as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Louisville's West End rioted. On May 27, 1968, {{a protest against}} police {{brutality}} was happening at Twenty-eighth and Greenwood Streets that eventually turned violent when the Louisville police jumped out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> with their guns already drawn. Louie B. Nunn called out the National Guard. 472 arrests were made, $200,000 in damages happened, and James Groves Jr, 14, and Washington Browder, 19, were murdered. Washington Browder had a fish sandwich still clutched in his hand when found on the sidewalk, shot dead, by a business owner. James Groves Jr. {{was shot in the}} back, after supposedly looting during the riots.|$|E
25|$|David Coulthard {{took a good}} {{eleventh}} position; his team-mate, Webber, retired due to a full hydraulics failure. Adrian Sutil {{retired after}} a large engine failure going towards the Stowe corner. Toyota suffered the worst problems as both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> {{went out of the}} race, Ralf Schumacher retiring with a wheel fixation problem, and his team mate, Trulli retiring with handling problems. Anthony Davidson, after a good weekend of practice and an unlucky qualifying session, had to retire his Super Aguri car when he felt vibrations from the underside of the car. Liuzzi retired his car with gearbox failure but was ultimately still classified in 16th place.|$|E
25|$|An example {{arrangement}} {{includes the}} stacking of two headlamps {{on each side}} with low beams above high beams. Nash used this arrangement in the 1957 model year. Pontiac used this design starting in the 1963 model year; American Motors, Ford, Cadillac and Chrysler followed two years later. Also in the 1965 model year, the Buick Riviera had concealable stacked headlamps. The Mercedes-Benz W100, W108, W111, and W112 models sold in America used this arrangement because their home-market composite lamps were illegal in the US. The British firm Alvis and the French firm Facel Vega also used this setup for some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars,</b> as did Nissan in Japan.|$|E
