We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, asking their name and {{remarking}} to Walden, [...] "Get them the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> give them {{to me in the}} studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E

[...] Her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum, from Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (who told Coulter, [...] "You have to be responsible ... in something like this, you gotta get the folks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> you have to report worst-case scenarios") to MSNBC's Ed Schulz (who stated that [...] "You would laugh at her if she wasn't making light of a terrible tragedy.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} men charged has been met with strong criticism as well as conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office {{in the summer of}} 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. [...] " [...] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I think that they wanted someone else to take a look and someone else to say, 'We know what's going on.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{employed}} a fanciful translation of [...] to imagine God's {{response to the}} Israelites' complaints in the wilderness. The Midrash taught that God asked the Israelites whether when a mortal king went into the wilderness, the king found there the same ease, the same food, or the same drink that he enjoyed in his own palace. The Midrash taught that the Israelites, however, were slaves in Egypt, and God brought them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> caused them to recline on lordly couches. In support of this, the Midrash reread [...] "But God led the people about, ( [...] , vayaseiv) by {{the way of the}} wilderness," [...] reading , vayaseiv, to mean God caused them [...] "to recline" [...] (using the same root , svv) in the manner of kings reclining upon their couches.|$|E

The band confirmed that they were going [...] "on indefinite hiatus" [...] to dispel reports of a split. [...] "We were barely even speaking," [...] Manson later admitted. [...] "We didn't want to talk to anyone outside of the band about the problems we were having with our career, so of course it turned into this whole passive-aggressive thing between us. I just wanted to get the fuck <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> go home." ...|$|E

Just like his first stint in the lead, he picked up another piece of debris that covered his grill. The third caution of the race flew on lap 44 for a single-car spin on the backstretch. Going down the backstretch, Johnson made contact with Mears that sent him spinning through the grass. His car dug into the ground and ripped off the front fender. He said afterwards that he [...] "did a decent job of backing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> not causing a big one as the door shut on me."
