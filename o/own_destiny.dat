5|$|Alexander then chased Darius, {{first into}} Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer {{controlled}} his <b>own</b> <b>destiny,</b> {{and was taken}} prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.|$|E

Delita joins Prince Goltana's forces {{to rise up}} through the ranks and gain control over his <b>own</b> <b>destiny.</b> Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg, though this proves futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work in the shadows, working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions. Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should control their <b>own</b> <b>destiny</b> and used his position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could agree on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E

5|$|The Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{was formed}} as the Bobby Boyd Congress in 1970, in homage to their {{original}} vocalist Bobby Boyd. Upon deciding that the funk scene in the United States was too saturated for them to viably compete in, they relocated to France in 1971; with Bobby Boyd splitting from the group to pursue a musical career in America, they renamed themselves 'Soul Congress', then 'Ice'. After regular performances in Paris' Barbès district—an area made up primarily of North African immigrants—they {{caught the eye of}} producer Pierre Jaubert and became the house session band at his Parisound studio. The influence of their surroundings led Ice to increasingly weave African rhyme schemes, textures, and beat tendencies in their original funk style, and as such they changed their name to Lafayette Afro Rock Band following the 1972 release of the poorly produced Each Man Makes His <b>Own</b> <b>Destiny.</b>|$|E
5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his <b>own</b> <b>destiny.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Jainism, Soul is {{the master}} of its <b>own</b> <b>destiny.</b> One of the qualities of the soul is {{complete}} lordship of its <b>own</b> <b>destiny.</b> The soul alone chooses its actions and soul alone reaps its consequences. No God or prophet or angel can interfere in the actions or the destiny of the soul. Furthermore, it is the soul alone who makes the necessary efforts to achieve liberation without any divine grace.|$|E
