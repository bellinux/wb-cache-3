Maintaining proper lubrication is not always possible during transient conditions. Therefore, a method for detection of lubricant loss is of great interest to the automotive industry. Three methods for detecting lubrication loss were examined: contact resistance, acoustic emission, and dynamic pressure oscillations. A mobile air conditioning test stand capable of recording many system parameters was used. <b>Oil</b> <b>return</b> to the compressor was monitored using an oil separator and a refrigerant/oil concentration sensor. Data were taken during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates and after oil shut off. The electrical contact resistance between the shoe and swashplate was used to indicate changes in the lubrication conditions at this critical interface. Measurements were taken at two <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates, during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> tests.

40|$|This {{program was}} aimed at {{understanding}} refrigerant/lubricant circulation issues, developing test data and approximate models that can predict operating regimes where good oil management can be assured. A dynamic test facility was constructed and used to examine <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> under varying system operating conditions. The development of industry guidelines for system reliability in using the new refrigerant blends was a goal of this program. To validate the guidelines, techniques and predictions, this dynamic test facility was used to obtain data to compare to the analytical predictions.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{to what extent}} how oil movements differently affect equity returns in general and sectoral levels of the GCC countries stock markets. Modeling the equity returns volatility requires using GARCH-type models. These models help to explore the pronounced differences of the conditional variance structures across sectors and markets. Chapter 1 compares the effects of changes in oil price return and its volatility on equity returns and volatility across sectors. The findings of this chapter show that despite the GCC states dependency on oil revenues, equity market performance at the sectoral level do not exactly associate with oil movements. Our results, in particular, show that the GCC stock markets do not always move hand-in-hand with oil market movements. In chapter 2, we explore the relationship within a specific sector, i. e. Banks sector in Saudi Arabia Stock market. We examine if oil price changes affect Islamic banks differently than conventional ones.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is an experimental investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> characteristics of alternative refrigerants for residential air conditioning systems using R 22. Due to the phase-out of HCFC refrigerants, the production of R 22 will be stopped by the year 2020. In some cases of vapor compression systems installed in the field, {{it will be necessary to}} replace the R 22 with alternative drop-in refrigerants as a part of maintenance procedures. Since R 22 system typically use mineral oils and HFC replacement refrigerants use POE or PAG oils. It may be necessary to change the type of oil used inside the system when retrofitting an existing R 22 system with an alternative drop-in refrigerant. Changing the oil in a vapor compression system is an expensive proposition due to the required flushing and cleaning of the system before the new oil can be installed. Therefore, refrigerant manufacturers are searching for alternative refrigerants, which are compatible with mineral oils and have similar working performance and conditions as R 22. The measurement of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> in the suction line helps to draw conclusions about the ability of the oil circulating back to the compressor.

Finally, it is found that storage announcement for natural gas significantly affects near-month and far-month natural gas futures returns. Furthermore, both natural gas and heating <b>oil</b> futures <b>returns</b> are affected more by the weighted average temperature reported by multiple weather reporting stations than that reported by a single weather reporting station...|$|R
5|$|Acclaimed by many across Latin America, he {{traveled}} to Venezuela where he met with President-elect Rómulo Betancourt, unsuccessfully requesting a loan and a new deal for Venezuelan <b>oil.</b> <b>Returning</b> home, an argument between Castro and senior government figures broke out. He was infuriated {{that the government had}} left thousands unemployed by closing down casinos and brothels. As a result, Prime Minister José Miró Cardona resigned, going into exile in the U.S. and joining the anti-Castro movement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} co-movement between {{oil prices and}} stock markets during the period 2006 – 2017 {{utilizing}} quantile regression. The studied stock indices are AEX, BOVESPA, CAC 40, DAX 30, EUROSTOXX 50, FTSE 100, SMI, S&P 500 and TSX 60, and the United States Oil Fund ETF represents the oil price. We investigate the co-movement and find a positive and significant co-movement between <b>oil</b> <b>returns</b> and stock market returns across quantiles {{for the stock market}} return distribution in all indices examined. The estimated coefficients from the quantile regression exhibit a U-shape, meaning that the dependence between <b>oil</b> <b>returns</b> and stock returns is strongest for high and low quantiles of the stock market distribution. However, we show that this U-shaped pattern disappears after we include implied volatility as an additional explanatory variable. Next, we find that the co-movement between oil and equity is asymmetric for most indices, with higher dependence in the lowermost quantiles. Finally, we find that the contribution of oil prices to value at risk of stock indices vary over time and is asymmetric, meaning that oil price risk contribute differently to the long position in the stock market than to the short position...|$|R
