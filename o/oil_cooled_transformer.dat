5000|$|Buildings 48-1 through 48-5 were {{transformer}} houses. The city of Peru {{provided a}} 33,000 volt transmission line that fed a sub-station at {{the northeast corner}} of the base. The sub-station had three 500KVA step down transformers that took the voltage from 33,000 volt, 3 phase, 3 wire to 12,500 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire. Primary distribution was then by aerial or underground transmission to secondary distribution locations. There were [...] of overhead line, with [...] of bare copper wire; and [...] of underground line, with [...] of lead covered cable, [...] of fiber conduit encased in concrete and 58 manholes. To further step down the voltage for use in buildings, 18 transformer banks were utilized, with 67 <b>oil</b> insulated, air <b>cooled</b> <b>transformers</b> in transformer vaults and transformer houses, with a total capacity of 3,119 KVA volts. Standby emergency electricity was supplied by two [...] generators connected to two 12 cylinder gasoline engines.|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{focuses on}} Direct Monitoring & Control of Transformer Temperature {{in order to}} avoid its Breakdown Using FOS (fiber optic sensor). Although there are various reasons for failure of transformer operation but mainly it is due to conductor loss and hysteresis losses which causes temperature rise in the internal structures of the transformer leading to burning of windings. A system for monitoring the temperature of transformers is required. Existing sensors cannot be used for monitoring the temperature of transformers because they are sensitive to electrical signals and can cause sparking which can trigger fire since there is <b>oil</b> in <b>transformers</b> <b>cooling</b> coils. Distributed FOS based on microbend is simulated on MATLAB 7. 5 in order to check the effectiveness of this sensor.

5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would crack.

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is the use}} {{of engine}} oil as a coolant, {{typically}} to remove surplus heat from an internal combustion engine.

25|$|Not until 1927 {{were there}} once again plans for {{conversion}} to electric operations. Now, however, high tension alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, {{was to be}} used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air <b>cooled</b> <b>transformers</b> could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant.

50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the {{in-block}} <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and the EGR <b>cooler</b> materials. The <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{completed}} {{under the direction}} of Jacobs Engineering are presented and discussed. In the first case study, the economics of the installation of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> are examined. A vapor recovery unit (VRU) for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility in Grieve, WY, will be installed to capture the vapors from an oil tank. With the installation of the VRU, a question arose: would an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> proposed to be installed before the oil tank be necessary? A simulation and economic analysis of the process suggests that <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is still economically favorable. When the low pressure (LP) separator is operated at the typical temperature of 140 °F, nine additional barrels of oil per day (BOPD) are recovered through the use of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The net present worth (NPW) of <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is calculated to be 248, 000. In the second case study, an overfill protection line was proposed to be installed for a gas flotation unit on an offshore oil rig. It was postulated {{that there might be a}} risk of hydrocarbon diffusion through the stagnant liquid in the line, presenting a hazard to equipment and personnel. Calculations were performed to approximate the rate of gas flux through the line. As the physical situation is difficult to model without precise information, alternative preventative methods are presented. ...|$|R
