40|$|Abstract. The {{motion of}} {{relativistic}} {{particles in the}} field produced by two circularly polarised, electromagnetic plane waves travelling in opposite directions is studied. The Klein-Gordon equation is used, i. e. spin effects are neglected, and only motion along the beam direction is considered. If the electromagnetic beams carry <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation,</b> the particle energy shows a band structure. The transmission of a plane particle wave through a long device is calculated. Transmission occurs only if the particle energy corresponds to an allowed energy band. For other energies the particles are totally reflected. For equal polarisation a similar structure emerges for the particle momentum along the beam direction. The observation of the band structure poses serious experimental problems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nearly all {{the neutral}} iridium {{complexes}} widely used as dopants in PhOLEDs are racemic mixtures; however, this study observed that these complexes can be separated into stable optically active Λ and ∆ isomers {{and that their}} chirality is an intrinsic property. The circularly polarised phosphorescent photoluminescence (CPPPL) signals of Λ/Δ isomers are perfect mirror images with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation</b> and equal intensity exhibiting a “handedness” for the polarisation. For the first time, we applied the Λ/Δ iridium isomers as emitters in OLEDs, and the circularly polarised phosphorescent electroluminescence (CPPEL) spectra reveal completely positive or negative broad peaks consistent with the CPPPL spectra. The results demonstrate that the Λ/Δ isomers have potential application for 3 D OLEDs because they can exhibit high efficiency and luminance, and 3 D display technology based on circularly polarised light is the most comfortable for the eyes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{simulate}} the cyclic circularly-polarised pulses of the ultra-cool dwarf TVLM 513 - 46546, observed with the VLA at 4. 88 and 8. 44 GHz on May 2006, {{by using a}} 3 D model of the auroral radio emission from the stellar magnetosphere. During this epoch, the radio light curves are characterised by two pulses left-hand polarised at 4. 88 GHz, and one doubly-peaked (of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisations)</b> pulse at 8. 44 GHz. To {{take into account the}} possible deviation from the dipolar symmetry of the stellar magnetic field topology, the model described in this paper is also able to simulate the auroral radio emission from a magnetosphere shaped like an offset-dipole. To reproduce the timing and pattern of the observed pulses, we explored the space of parameters controlling the auroral beaming pattern and the geometry of the magnetosphere. Through the analysis of the TVLM 513 - 46546 auroral radio emission, we derive some indications on the magnetospheric field topology that is able to simultaneously reproduce the timing and patterns of the auroral pulses measured at 4. 88 and 8. 44 GHz. Each set of model solutions simulates two auroral pulses (singly or doubly peaked) per period. To explain the presence of only one 8. 44 GHz pulse per period, we analyse the case of auroral radio emission limited only to a magnetospheric sector activated by an external body, like the case of the interaction of Jupiter with its moons.

40|$|Based on {{the dual}} {{principle}} in super-luminous Lorentz transformation this work shows that pseudo-spin of a time-like bradyon appears to space-like observers as iso-spin of a corresponding tachyon. Due to the weak interaction, lepton-tachyon appears as neutrino with hidden imaginary transcendent mass, suppressed {{by a factor}} of ρ ∼ GFm 2 0 compared to the rest mass m 0 of a corresponding space-like lepton. Assuming a coexistence of tachyon dark matter in the solar system, we show that the solar neutrino deficit might be explained by depolarisation of time-like electrons due to elastic scattering in time-like plasma and the maximal deficit would reach 0. 5. Neither day-night nor seasonal effects are expected due to dynamic balance of fluxes with <b>opposite</b> pseudo-spin <b>polarisation.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The {{high energy}} polarised muon beam {{available}} at CERN with {{the option of}} using positive or negative muons with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation</b> gives COMPASS an excellent possibility to study generalised parton distributions via deeply virtual Compton scattering. In a first step we propose to use an unpolarised proton target to study {{the slope of the}} $t$ dependence of the differential cross section as a function of $x_{Bj}$ to observe a possible shrinkage of the nucleon with increasing $x_{Bj}$. Furthermore, the beam charge and spin difference will be measured over a wide kinematical range to determine the Compton form factor related to the GPD $H$. As a second step we consider to use a transversely polarised proton target to collect data to constrain the GPD $E$.

40|$|We numerically compute {{light and}} {{polarization}} curves of gamma-ray burst afterglows for various configurations {{of the jet}} structure and for different dynamical evolutions.

We show instead that polarisation curves are a powerful mean to solve the jet structure, since the predicted behaviour of polarisation and its position angle at times around the jet break (t_jet) are <b>opposite.</b> <b>Polarisation</b> from homogeneous jets has a minimum at t_jet associated with a rotation by 90 degree of the position angle, while polarisation from a structured jet has a maximum at t_jet and it is characterised by a constant position angle throughout the entire evolution.

40|$|Internal conical {{refraction}} {{leads to}} the formation of zero (J 0) and first order (J 1) Bessel beams in superposition. The (J 0) beam retains the input circular polarisation and the (J 1) has <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation</b> but with a single phase change around the beam axis giving it ? optical angular momentum per photon.

This provides a simple system in which a beam of 0, ? and ? optical angular momentum can be easily generated and selected with use of only a circular polariser. In the far field the characteristic Bessel beam structures are formed and can be made non-diverging with use of a lens. We report the formation of non-diverging Bessel beam of core diameter (a) of 5. 7 ?m over a maximum non-diverging core length of 1 (?. 05) mm.

40|$|The Rashba {{effect is}} one of the most {{striking}} manifestations of spin-orbit coupling in solids, and provides a cornerstone for the burgeoning field of semiconductor spintronics. It is typically assumed to manifest as a momentum-dependent splitting of a single initially spin-degenerate band into two branches with <b>opposite</b> spin <b>polarisation.</b> Here, combining polarisation-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission measurements with density-functional theory calculations, we show that the two "spin-split" branches of the model giant Rashba system BiTeI additionally develop disparate orbital textures, each of which is coupled to a distinct spin configuration. This necessitates a re-interpretation of spin splitting in Rashba-like systems, and opens new possibilities for controlling spin polarisation through the orbital sector.

40|$|We {{study the}} low energy {{effective}} field theory of fermions with electric and magnetic dipole moments at finite temperature. We find that at one loop there is an interaction term of the Chern-Simon form L_I=m_μA_νF̃^μν. The four vector m_μ≃ d_i μ_i m_i^ 2 ∂_μ(ln T) is interpreted as a Chern- Simon type mass of photons, which {{is determined by the}} electric (magnetic) dipole moments d_i (μ_i) of the fermions in the vacuum polarisation loop diagram. The physical consequence of such a photon mass is that, photons of <b>opposite</b> circular <b>polarisations,</b> propagating through a hot medium, have different group velocities. We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left and right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light propagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is T ∼ 100 MeV) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals of frequency ω will be Δ t(ω) ≃ 10 ^- 6 /ω. It may be possible to observe this effect in pulsar signals which propagate through nebula at high temperatures. Comment: plain TeX, 9 page...|$|R
40|$|Polarisation {{of radio}} pulsar {{profiles}} involves {{a number of}} poorly understood, intriguing phenomena, such as the existence of comparable amounts of orthogonal polarisation modes (OPMs), strong distortions of polarisation angle (PA) curves into shapes inconsistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), and the strong circular polarisation V which can be maximum (instead of zero) at the OPM jumps. It is shown {{that the existence of}} comparable OPMs and of the large V results from a coherent addition of phase-delayed waves in natural propagation modes, which are produced by an incident linearly polarised signal. The coherent mode summation implies <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation</b> properties to those known from the incoherent case, in particular, the OPM jumps occur at peaks of V, whereas V changes sign at a maximum of the linear polarisation fraction L/I. These features are indispensable to interpret various observed polarisation effects. It is shown that statistical properties of the emission mechanism and of propagation effects can be efficiently parametrised in a simple model of coherent mode addition, which is successfully applied to complex polarisation phenomena, such as the stepwise PA curve of PSR B 1913 + 16 and the strong distortions of the PA curve within core components of pulsars B 1933 + 16 and B 1237 + 25. The inclusion of coherent mode addition opens the possibility for a number of new polarisation effects, such as inversion of relative modal strength, twin minima in L/I coincident with peaks in V, 45 deg PA jumps in weakly polarised emission, and loop-shaped core PA distortions. The empirical treatment of the coherency of mode addition makes it possible to advance the understanding of pulsar polarisation beyond the RVM model.

40|$|The spin {{structure}} of the nucleon has been studied at the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) measurements are a powerful tool to access the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and the Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMD PDFs). The COMPASS polarised target gives the opportunity to measure the azimuthal modulations depending on the spin orientation and the extraction of the transverse spin asymmetries, which are convolutions of TMD PDFs of the nucleon and Fragmentation Functions (FF). The analysis of these data is done in several kinematic bins, which provides a vast input for the theoreticians to extract the TMDs and the FFs and their kinematic dependence. The TMD PDFs are also accessible through the measurement of the Drell-Yan process, {{in this case the}} transverse spin asymmetries are convolutions of two TMD PDFs, one corresponding to the annihilating quark from the beam hadron and the other to the annihilating quark from the target hadron. In COMPASS a negative pion beam and the polarised protons from ammonia target allow the measurement of the polarised DY process. In 2010 the COMPASS data taking was dedicated to the measurement of the SIDIS process, the naturally polarised positive muons scattering off a transversely polarised proton target. The detection of the scattering muon and the final state hadrons give access to the angular modulations. The three target cells are transversely polarised, the two outer ones oppositely to the inner one, and this configuration changes every two weeks. The events are combined between the two sub-periods with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarisation,</b> which allows to better control possible systematic effects. The analysis of these data in bins of Q^ 2, x, pT h, z, y and W is presented. The 2015 COMPASS data taking was dedicated to the polarised DY measurement. As the COMPASS experiment was designed and developed for DIS and spectroscopy measurements, it had to suffer modifications for the DY measurement. The DY process has a very low cross-section, thus a high intensity beam is mandatory. A hadron absorber has been added just downstream of the target to stop the secondary hadrons allowing only the passage of the muon pairs. This protects the detectors from possible radiation damage while keeping the combinatorial background at a reasonable level. A short DY beam test run, using a hadron absorber prototype, was performed in 2009. The analysis of these data is presented in this thesis. The 2015 DY run was preceded by a pilot run in 2014, with the majority of the 2015 setup already set up, but still with no target polarisation. The analysis of these data is also presented in this thesis, as well as the analysis of some preliminary reconstructed 2015 data. COMPASS has the opportunity to access the TMD PDFs from two independent processes and selecting the same phase space coverage. These results are very promising for the TMD PDFs community, since the theoretical prediction that the Sivers TMD must change sign when accessed through the DY or the SIDIS processes should be verified with these data...|$|E
