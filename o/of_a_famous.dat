5|$|In 1968, Ricky Nelson {{released}} his concept album Perspective, {{a move to}} expand his musical horizons. The album included songs by Newman, Nilsson and others woven together {{to tell the story}} of the interactions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> family; author Kevin Courrier writes that this album may have been part of the inspiration for Nilsson Sings Newman.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. There {{is very little}} evidence which shows his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was {{proud to be a}} student <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod. The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, and changed the original cover art <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus (died 24 April 624) was {{the first}} Bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity. He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604. Mellitus was the {{recipient}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> letter from Pope Gregory I known as the Epistola ad Mellitum, preserved in a later work by the medieval chronicler Bede, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. In 610, Mellitus returned to Italy to attend a council of bishops, and returned to England bearing papal letters to some of the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E

5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, he was the son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 {{expedition}} by RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} 28 dives during which over 800 artefacts were recovered, including the ship's engine telegraphs, perfume vials and watertight door gears. In 2001, an American couple – David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller – caused controversy {{when they were}} married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of Titanic, in a deliberate echo <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> scene from James Cameron's 1997 film. The wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a British company called SubSea Explorer which had offered a free dive to Titanic that Leibowitz had won. He asked whether his fiancée could come too {{and was told that}} she could– but only if she agreed to get married during the trip. The same company also brought along Philip Littlejohn, the grandson of one of Titanics surviving crew members, who became the first relative of a Titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. Cameron himself also returned to Titanic in 2001 to carry out filming for Walt Disney Pictures' Ghosts of the Abyss, filmed in 3D.|$|E
