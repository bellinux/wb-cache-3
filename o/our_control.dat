Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond <b>Our</b> <b>Control,</b> recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition.

25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So <b>our</b> <b>control</b> of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E

500|$|Casualties on {{both sides}} were heavy. Another {{skirmish}} took place several days later, when the English engaged Frenchmen, disembarked from ships retreating from Portsmouth to look for fresh water. A senior French commander, Chevalier D'Aux, was killed. [...] The assumed English victory at Bonchurch only had a marginal impact on {{the course of the}} war, because it only involved a fraction of the forces engaged throughout. Had the French captured the island, it is unlikely this would have drastically affected the war, because more significant territory was being contested. However, the island could have been used to support French operations against England; Claude d'Annebault, commander of the French armada, recorded: “having it [...] under <b>our</b> <b>control,</b> we could then dominate Portsmouth... and so put the enemy to extraordinary expense in maintaining a standing army and navy to contain us.” Although some sources do claim that the victory at Bonchurch was responsible for the French withdrawal, the source that claims a French victory says that fighting at Bembridge was ultimately responsible for forcing the French to leave.|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond <b>our</b> <b>control,</b> meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Virtual Network Topology (VNT) is one {{efficient}} way to transfer IP packets over wavelength-routed optical net-works. In recent years various new services have emerged, and IP traffic has been highly fluctuated. Therefore, adaptability against changes of traffic {{is one of the}} most important char-acteristics to accommodate the IP traffic efficiently. To achieve the adaptability, we have proposed a VNT control method using an attractor selection model. In this paper, we investigate the adaptability of <b>our</b> VNT <b>control</b> method via computer simulations. Simulation results on various physical topologies indicate that <b>our</b> VNT <b>control</b> method can successfully adapt to changes of traffic around twice higher variance comparing with conventional VNT control methods.

[...] Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform [...] "in our own way, including involving a charity" [...] and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival. The band had no intention to reunite before this decision. Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroethics also {{encompasses}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} neuroscience as it affects {{our understanding of the}} world and of ourselves in the world. [...] For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions? [...] A crime in the United States requires a [...] "guilty act" [...] and a [...] "guilty mind". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used {{in the criminal justice system}} and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of <b>our</b> <b>control.</b> [...] The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2011, during Screeching Weasel's South by Southwest Festival {{performance}} at the Scoot Inn in Austin, Texas, Foster punched {{the face of a}} female audience member who had thrown a beer and ice cubes at him, and also spit in his face. As a result a woman on the stage, believed to be the club's owner, grabbed him from behind, and Ben mistaking her for an attacking fan turned around and punched her twice in the scuffle. Foster was then restrained by security and left the venue. On March 22, Foster apologized. On March 23, Punknews.org posted a statement from the four other members of Screeching Weasel, Dan Schafer, Adam Cargin, Justin Perkins and Drew Fredrichsen, announcing their resignation from the band. [...] "The un-calculated act put forth by Ben 'Weasel' Foster leading up to and including the violence that erupted on stage is seen by the band as shameful and embarrassing.

2500|$|Attenborough {{starts the}} second {{programme}} {{by looking at}} potential future events, before warning that what happens {{over the next few}} years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38°C for the UK are [...] "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4°C and 5.8°C. Or, says Attenborough, [...] "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." [...] The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2°C rise for the south of England, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the 2004 Boscastle flood, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as [...] "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon tropical rainforest were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of Texas has been lost over the last 20 years.
