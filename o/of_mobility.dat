A Soviet offensive launched on 25 February by the Central Front against Army Group Center had to be abandoned by 7 March to allow the attacking formations to disengage and redeploy to the south {{to counter the threat}} of the advancing German forces under Manstein.

This paper discusses the implications <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> for destination governance where fluid populations of tourists, residents, second home owners and recreationists, and transnational flows of labour and capital intersect {{to create and}} recreate the physical, social, economic and political characteristics of place. Three key processes that affect destination management are identified: the spatial restructuring of destinations, the pluralisation of destination management and the re-envisioning of community. In {{a study of the}} hyper-neoliberal destination of the Gold Coast, Australia, mobilities are examined and implications for governance are discussed. Our research highlights the challenges of measuring, evaluating and understanding the extent and complexity <b>of</b> <b>mobilities,</b> and explores the tensions between mobilities and established sustainable tourism principles that suggest governance should be grounded in local community dialogue and values. The differences between “hard” and “soft” power structures in destination governance are noted. The paper contributes methodological insights into the study <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> and to theoretical and practical debates about the influence <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> on sustainable destination management, especially the need to re-visit the meanings of long-accepted concepts in sustainable tourism, including “public interest”, “community” and “community-based” tourism...|$|R

40|$|Foucault {{spent time}} {{investigating}} the stopping <b>of</b> <b>mobilities,</b> notably when studying carceral spaces such as asylums and prisons which effectively immobilise their inmates at a societal scale. In Discipline and Punish, he speculates on how such spaces {{are designed to}} put a stop to casual ‘nomadisms’. The purpose here is to inspect this aspect of Foucault’s thinking, particularly to recover what he also said about the regulation and cultivation <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> within the depths of immobility. Attention is also drawn to an engagement with mobility-immobility appearing in Foucault’s little-discussed Psychiatric Power lectures, prompted by the ideas and practices of Edouard Seguin, an educator of ‘idiot’ children, whose own words provide additional ‘empirical’ weight to an emerging argument. Reading the unabridged English translation of Madness and Civilization, a final claim is that Foucault’s phenomenology of ‘madness’ depends upon unruly mobilities within the asylum, the very stuff of ‘unstable and dangerous coagulation’.

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of this journal ten years ago, the field <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> {{research}} has developed at a rapid pace. In this editorial introduction we explore how this development has been curated, how the field has evolved, and what maturation might mean for mobilities research. After reviewing how early editorials encouraged particular trajectories <b>of</b> development within <b>mobilities</b> research, we introduce the papers in this special issue, which build upon and re-shape key discussions that have emerged in the last decade. Drawing out issues of power, interdisciplinarity, social processes and futures, the papers raise important questions about not only how understandings <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> are changing, but also how the field <b>of</b> <b>mobilities</b> research is itself on the move. Taking up these themes, we examine how understanding mobilities research as a field, following Bourdieu (1984), contributes to considerations {{of the potential for}} future struggles, fragmentation, and sub-disciplines. We argue that the open nature and strategic diversity <b>of</b> the <b>mobilities</b> field has fed the successes of the past decade, and therefore needs to remain a priority in the future – with a careful balance curated between convergence around key themes and the exploration of varied ‘internal goods’ (MacIntyre 1985) which remain an important source of inspiration and creative potential within the field...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the application of two new techniques, both of which depend essentially on improved instrumentation, to the study <b>of</b> the electrophoretic <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> red cells and their ghosts. The first technique has been developed to overcome difficulties which are encountered in the measurement <b>of</b> the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> ghosts. If the ghosts are substantially haemoglobinized, they can be seen, although with some difficulty, with the ordinary microscope and their mobility can be measured in an electrophoresis cell such as that described by Abramson (1934); if they are relatively Hb-free, on the other hand, they are almost invisible under the ordinary microscope, and can be seen satisfactorily only with phase contrast. The great majority of existing measurements <b>of</b> the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> ghosts, accordingly, are measurements <b>of</b> the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> ghosts which contain relatively large amounts of Hb. The new vertical cell to be described uses phase-contrast optics, and is fitted with removable electrodes which have several advantages over those usually employed.
