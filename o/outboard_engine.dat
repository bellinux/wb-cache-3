25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The left <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> lost power, and shortly afterwards the right <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 18 September 1953, while {{based at}} Kindley, Bermuda, the {{squadron}} suffered its only mission-related loss of an aircraft, a WB-29. Returning to base with a runaway propeller on the inboard {{engine of the}} right wing, the propeller separated from its shaft and struck the engine beside it, causing both the wing and <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> to catch fire. The pilot ordered an immediate bailout, but the aircraft went {{out of control and}} only three of the 10-man crew survived.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight was}} uneventful until the No. 1 engine, the <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> {{on the left}} wing, began {{backfiring}} and running roughly as the airplane neared Nashville, Tennessee. After reducing power and attempting corrective measures, the flight crew shut down the engine and feathered the propeller near Altheimer, Arkansas. Engine failures were considered fairly routine events on piston-engined airliners in the 1940s, so the crew elected to continue the flight to Dallas, and Captain Claude announced to the passengers that they would switch to another airplane upon arrival.|$|E

40|$|The 1980 s was an {{important}} period {{in the development of}} marine fisheries in Kerala. In {{the first half of this}} period rapid motorisation of the indigenous crafts with <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> made the traditional sector more efficient. <b>Outboard</b> <b>engines</b> became an integral part of the indigenous fisheries and the fishers could extend their activities to more distant and deeper waters. Slowly they started discarding their old dugouts and going for plank-built boats with transformed stern to fix their <b>outboard</b> <b>engines</b> conveniently. In the latter half of the 1980 s a new gear called ringseine became very popular in exploiting the pelagic resources and replaced the boatseines to a very great extent...|$|R
25|$|Four Kuznetsov NK-86 two-spool with five-stage LP compressors, six-stage HP compressors, annular {{combustor}} cans, single-stage HP turbine and two-stage LP turbine turbofan engines {{power the}} Il-86. The cascade thrust reversers are canted 15° {{in respect to}} the horizontal axis. Pneumatic starters start the engines (airborne relights use the windmill effect). The forward-facing ejectors blow away detritus during taxi. International Standard Atmosphere hourly fuel consumption per engine is 7.7t (16,975lb) at maximum continuous rated thrust, 6t/13,230lb at nominal maximum thrust, 5.1t (11,243lb) at 85% thrust, 4.2t/9260lb at 70%, 3.6t (7,937lb) at 60%, 2.45t (5,400lb) at 40% and 1t (2,205lb) at idle. Overall hourly fuel consumption at long-range cruise and 190t (419,000lb) is 9.75t (21,495lb) reducing to 7.79t (17,174lb) at 140t (308,650lb). <b>Outboard</b> <b>engine</b> pylons on the latter two-thirds of all Il-86s are marginally extended to cut drag.|$|E
500|$|During {{later stages}} of the flight test program, flutter testing showed that the wings {{suffered}} oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles of the early 747s. This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, for example El Al Flight 1862 at Amsterdam in 1992 with [...] of uranium in the tailplane (horizontal stabilizer).|$|E
500|$|Four {{struck the}} Shinano, {{at an average}} depth of [...] The first hit towards the stern, {{flooding}} refrigerated storage compartments {{and one of the}} empty aviation gasoline storage tanks, and killing many of the sleeping engineering personnel in the compartments above. The second hit the compartment where the starboard outboard propeller shaft entered the hull and flooded the <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> room. The third hit further forward, flooding the No. 3 boiler room and killing every man on watch. Structural failures caused the two adjacent boiler rooms to flood as well. The fourth flooded the starboard air compressor room, adjacent anti-aircraft gun magazines, and the No. 2 damage-control station, and ruptured the adjacent oil tank.|$|E

500|$|The second attack started {{just before}} 13:00. In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high {{overhead}} {{to begin their}} runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed {{by the number of}} targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. Yamatos main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing—a mere [...] from the ship—but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fireroom that had already been hit, one impacted a different fireroom, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth, unconfirmed, hit may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location. This attack left Yamato in a perilous position, listing ° to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to °, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant that the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The 161 was an {{all-metal}} monoplane with a high, semi-cantilever wing, braced on {{each side}} {{by a pair of}} parallel struts between the lower fuselage and the wing near the first <b>outboard</b> <b>engine.</b> The engines were mounted on a constant chord central section but the outer panels were tapered, with ailerons interconnected to Handley Page slots near the wing tips. [...] The trailing edges carried split flaps. [...] The flying boat's wing stabilizing floats retracted vertically to the outer engine cowlings. [...] The tail unit was of the twin endplate fin type with the tailplane, mounted with marked dihedral, on a fuselage pedestal and externally braced from below. The D-shaped fins were fixed to the tailplane a little below their horizontal mid-lines and were also lightly braced, with struts between them and the upper tailplane surfaces.|$|E

2500|$|It {{took about}} 12 seconds for the rocket {{to clear the}} tower. During this time, it yawed 1.25 degrees away from the tower to ensure {{adequate}} clearance despite adverse winds. (This yaw, although small, {{can be seen in}} launch photos taken from the east or west.) At an altitude of [...] the rocket rolled to the correct flight azimuth and then gradually pitched down until 38 seconds after second stage ignition. This pitch program was set according to the prevailing winds during the launch month. The four outboard engines also tilted toward the outside so that {{in the event of a}} premature <b>outboard</b> <b>engine</b> shutdown the remaining engines would thrust through the rocket's center of gravity. The Saturn V reached [...] at over [...] in altitude. Much of the early portion of the flight was spent gaining altitude, with the required velocity coming later. The Saturn V broke the sound barrier at just over 1 minute at an altitude of between 3 and 4 nautical miles. At this point, shock collars, or condensation clouds, could be seen forming around the bottom of the command module and around the top of the second stage.|$|E
