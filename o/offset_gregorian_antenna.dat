A low-side mount has some logistical and maintenance advantages over the high-side counterpart, since the feed can be accessed {{without the need for}} a crane.

40|$|Interference in {{radio-relay}} links {{caused by}} multipath propagation {{can be reduced}} {{by the use of}} receiving antennas with adaptive beam orientation. High-performance radio-relay antennas with low sidelobes and high polarization purity frequently consist of dual-offset reflectors with low edge illumination and feeds with low cross-polarization level. A simple means for achieving beam scanning with an antenna is the use of a dual-feed, which consists of two corrugated horns penetrating into each other. Measurements of such a feed were done with a 3 m <b>offset</b> <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antenna</b> (''shell antenna'') in the frequency band 9 - 11 GHz. It results that the phase centres of the dual-feed are not located as close as it would correspond to their geometrical distance. For this reason, the cross-over level of the two main beams of the antenna was by 2. 5 dB lower than expected. This effect can be compensated for by filling the feed horns partially with a dielectric foam. With an axial distance of 38 mm (corresponding to 1. 27 wavelengths) a cross-over level of - 2. 5 to - 3 dB was achieved. The low side-lobe level in the horizontal antenna pattern remains unchanged. However, the near-in sidelobes in the vertical pattern are increased. The maximum cross-polarization level amounts to - 27 dB (in comparison: - 31 dB for a single-feed horn) in the investigated frequency region. The cross-polarization can be diminished by enlarging the axial distance of the two horns, resulting in a decreased cross-over level. Another method for diminishing the cross-polarization level is the use of a feed with a larger beamwidth. But in this case, the sidelobes rise in the horizontal pattern. Moreover, the cross-over level is by 0. 2 dB to 0. 5 dB lower than {{in the case of the}} dual-feed with lower edge illumination. (orig.)

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} {{on the performance of}} the Cassegrain and Gregorian on-axis, off-axis and offset antennas. In our study, we have adopted the design parameters for the Cassegrain configuration used in the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) project. Modifications on the original parameters are made so as to meet the design requirement for the off-axis and offset configurations. To reduce spillover loss in the offset antennas, we have adjusted the angle between the axis of the primary reflector and that of the sub-reflector, so that the feed horn is placed right next {{to the edge of the}} primary reflector. This is to allow the offset antennas to receive the highest power at the feed horn. The results obtained from the physical optics simulation show that the radiation characteristics of both Cassegrain and <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antennas</b> are similar. The offset designs exhibit the best performance, followed by the on-axis, and, finally, the off-axis designs. Our analysis also shows that the performance of both <b>offset</b> Cassegrain and <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antennas</b> are comparable to each other...|$|R

A pins-made feed, that uses EBG concepts, PCB extension of the one presented in [4] has been used to efficiently feed the dual reflector system. However it has not been discussed here for the sake of brevity. Good performance of the antenna has been observed. The planar dual reflector system could be used in future planar imaging system applications, to achieve antennas with independent beams in the azimuth and elevation planes, resorting to frequency reuse and multiple focal plane feeds. The scanning of the pointing angle with the frequency is observed. In particular since the final user of these antenna is a radar system whose beam is scanned {{as a function of the}} frequency, the frequency squint that was observed in Fig. 3 should not be considered a disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|Reflector antennas {{are widely}} used in {{communication}} satellite systems because they provide high gain at low cost. Offset-fed single paraboloids and dual reflector <b>offset</b> Cassegrain and <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antennas</b> with multiple focal region feeds provide a simple, blockage-free means of forming multiple, shaped, and isolated beams with low sidelobes. Such antennas are applicable to communications satellite frequency reuse systems and earth stations requiring access to several satellites. While the single offset paraboloid {{has been the most}} extensively used configuration for the satellite multiple-beam antenna, the trend toward large apertures requiring minimum scanned beam degradation over the field of view 18 degrees for full earth coverage from geostationary orbit may lead to impractically long focal length and large feed arrays. Dual reflector antennas offer packaging advantages and more degrees of design freedom to improve beam scanning and cross-polarization properties. The Cassegrain and <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antennas</b> are the most commonly used dual reflector antennas. A computer program for calculating the secondary pattern and directivity of a generalized dual reflector antenna system was developed and implemented at LeRC. The theoretical foundation for this program is based on the use of physical optics methodology for describing the induced currents on the sub-reflector and main reflector. The resulting induced currents on the main reflector are integrated to obtain the antenna far-zone electric fields. The computer program is verified with other physical optics programs and with measured antenna patterns. The comparison shows good agreement in far-field sidelobe reproduction and directivity...|$|R
40|$|Radio telescopes {{striving for}} orders of {{magnitude}} more sensitivity in the cm-wave band require reflector antennas with high performance at low relative cost compared to conventional approaches. The Composite Applications for Radio Telescopes (CART) programme at the National Research Council's (NRC's) Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, near Penticton Canada has been investigating ways to build such telescopes since 2005.

This paper addresses design concepts of the broadband, exceptionally sensitive receivers and reflector antennas deployed in the SKA 1 -Mid radio telescope to be located in South Africa. SKA 1 -Mid (350 MHz - 13. 8 GHz with an option for an upper limit of similar to 24 GHz) will consist of 133 reflector antennas using an unblocked aperture, <b>offset</b> <b>Gregorian</b> configuration with an effective diameter of 15 m. Details on the unblocked aperture <b>Gregorian</b> <b>antennas,</b> low noise front ends and advanced direct digitization receivers, are provided from a system design perspective. The unblocked aperture results in increased aperture efficiency and lower side-lobe levels compared to a traditional on-axis configuration. The low side-lobe level reduces the noise contribution due to ground pick-up but also makes the antenna less susceptible to ground-based RFI sources. The addition of extra shielding on the sub-reflector provides a further reduction of ground pick-up. The optical design of the SKA 1 -Mid reflector antenna has been tweaked using advanced EM simulation tools in combination with sophisticated models for sky, atmospheric and ground noise contributions. This optimal antenna design in combination with very low noise, partially cryogenic, receivers and wide instantaneous bandwidth provide excellent receiving sensitivity in combination with instrumental flexibility to accommodate {{a wide range of}} astronomical observation modes...|$|R
