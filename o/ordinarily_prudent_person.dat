50|$|Given {{that the}} {{directors}} can not ensure corporate success, the business judgment rule specifies {{that the court}} will not review the business decisions of directors who performed their duties (1) in good faith; (2) with the care that an <b>ordinarily</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the directors reasonably believe {{to be in the}} best interests of the corporation. As part of their duty of care, directors have a duty not to waste corporate assets by overpaying for property or employment services. The business judgment rule is very difficult to overcome and courts will not interfere with directors unless it is clear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, etc.|$|E

The trial court found for defendants, holding that plaintiff failed to prove actual or constructive notice of the patch of ice on the mat. The D.C.

Several states have statutes adopting some variation of these duties which would be used in court {{to determine whether a}} board member acted improperly. These standards are usually described as the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty of obedience. Duty of Care The duty of care describes the level of competence that is expected of a board member and is commonly expressed as the duty of "care that an <b>ordinarily</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> would exercise in a like position and under similar circumstances. " This means that a board member owes the duty to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision as a steward of the organization. Duty of Loyalty The duty of loyalty is a standard of faithfulness; a board member must give undivided allegiance when making decisions affecting the organization. This means that a board member can never use information obtained as a member for personal gain, but must act {{in the best interests of}} the organization...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} Canadian pension funds relative to those from the UK and US, {{in the light of}} the ongoing quantitative asset restrictions that still apply in Canada, compared with the purer <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> approach in the UK and US. We find that although Canadian funds often obtain better combinations of return and risk, returns are often less than could be obtained given financial market conditions, as shown by dummy portfolios split evenly between bonds and equities, or diversified into real estate, as well as mean-variance optimal portfolios. In contrast, UK and US funds typically outperform such benchmarks. Combined with criticisms of specific Canadian regulations in the light of finance theory and empirical evidence, the paper makes a case for removal of residual quantitative restrictions in Canada, and their replacement by sole <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> regulations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the rationale, nature and financial consequences of two alternative approaches to portfolio regulations {{for the long-term}} institutional investor sectors life insurance and pension funds. These approaches are, respectively, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules and quantitative portfolio restrictions. The argument draws on the financial-economics of investment, the differing characteristics of institutions’ liabilities, and the overall case for regulation of financial institutions. Among the conclusions are: · regulation of life insurance and pensions need not be identical; · <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules are superior to quantitative restrictions for pension funds except in certain specific circumstances (which may arise notably in emerging market economies), and; · although in general restrictions may be less damaging for life insurance than for pension funds, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> rules may nevertheless be desirable in certain cases also for this sector, particularly in competitive life sectors in advanced countries, and for pension contracts offered by life insurance companies. These results have implications inter alia for an appropriate strategy of liberalisation. 1 The author is Professor of Economics and Finance, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB 3 4 PH, United Kingdom (e-mail ‘e_philip_davis@msn. com’, website: ‘www. geocities. com/e_philip_davis’).
