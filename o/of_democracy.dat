5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages <b>of</b> <b>democracy.</b> To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The {{competing}} parties' war propaganda {{aimed to}} prove their support <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> and liberty {{and their ability to}} represent the whole Finnish nation.

5|$|Before {{going to}} London Grainger had {{composed}} numerous Kipling settings, {{and his first}} mature orchestral pieces. In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that {{he was working on}} his Marching Song <b>of</b> <b>Democracy</b> (a Walt Whitman setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music and Charging Irishrey. In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right.

5|$|Khánh {{promised that}} the village {{elections}} abolished under Diệm would be held as soon as feasible and that a new National Assembly would be elected within a year. He started by abolishing the Council of Notables. Many Vietnamese and American observers considered this rash and premature, as promises of elections been frequently broken and that the council had at least been an effective forum for dissent, giving the semblance <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> {{in the absence of}} parliamentary representation.|$|E
5|$|No one {{government}} in the Commonwealth exercises power over the others, {{as is the case}} in a political union. Rather, the Commonwealth is an international organisation in which countries with diverse social, political, and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status, and cooperate within a framework of common values and goals, as outlined in the Singapore Declaration issued in 1971. Such common values and goals include the promotion <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> human rights, good governance, the rule of law, individual liberty, egalitarianism, free trade, multilateralism, and world peace, which are promoted through multilateral projects and meetings, such as the Commonwealth Games, held once every four years.|$|E

On 21 December 2011, in an interview with National Post, he criticized US support for royal dictatorships in the region and contrasted the hard attitude shown towards Syria and Libya with the soft attitude towards allies.|$|E
5|$|Seen as a restorer <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> Endara {{was later}} noted for having defended {{freedom of speech}} and {{democratic}} institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the Panamanian Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the primacy of the civilian government, and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara's urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch.|$|E
