When dealing with the issue chosen, I analysed the sources of inspiration for the interpretation and inference of legal concepts of the current legislation applicable to defects <b>of</b> <b>tours,</b> which present interpretive guidance for the interpretation and understanding of the defects <b>of</b> <b>tours.</b> First, I analysed the regulation of the consequences of a breach of contract as contained in the Package Tour Directive, which is a model for defects <b>of</b> <b>tours</b> in the Czech law and which regulates the reasons for liberation from the responsibility <b>of</b> a <b>tour</b> organiser for any breach of contract.
