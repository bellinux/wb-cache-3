5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an <b>oil</b> <b>mill.</b> In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok, the <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} process of vegetable oil involves {{the removal of}} oil from plant components, typically seeds.

25|$|His fellow captives {{included}} many political prisoners, who {{were forced to}} perform hard labour for many years. Reunited with his brother Ganesh, the Savarkars nevertheless struggled in the harsh environment: Forced to arise at 5am, tasks including cutting trees and chopping wood, and working at the <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> under regimental strictness, with talking amidst prisoners strictly prohibited during mealtime. Prisoners were subject to frequent mistreatment and torture. Contact {{with the outside world}} and home was restricted to the writing and mailing of one letter a year. In these years, Savarkar withdrew within himself and performed his routine tasks mechanically. Obtaining permission to start a rudimentary jail library, Savarkar would also teach some fellow convicts to read and write.|$|E

25|$|In 1780, what is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} the first hat shop in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict (although hat making existed in Danbury before the Revolution); it had three employees, and they made 18 hats weekly. By 1800, Danbury was producing 20,000 hats annually, more than any other city in the U.S. Due to the fur felt hat coming back into style for men and increasing mechanization in the 1850s, by 1859 hat production in Danbury had risen to 1.5 million annually. By 1887, thirty factories were producing 5 million hats per year. Around this time, fur processing was separated from hat manufacturing when the P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company (1884) on <b>Oil</b> <b>Mill</b> Road and the White Brothers' factory began operation.|$|E
25|$|With ocean {{access and}} vast tracts of forest, the South {{is home to}} a good deal of industry. Timber is a {{substantial}} part of the region's economy, and various logging companies have operations in the area. However, because the largest trees within the South itself have mostly been harvested, the region is increasingly being used as a transport network for logging vehicles from Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo {{on their way to the}} ports of Kribi and Douala. Kribi is also the site of sawmills, and a palm <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> operates in Lobé. Ebolowa was in past years an important ivory-working center, but government regulations and the scarcity of elephants in modern times have dampened this part of the economy. Much of the South's electricity is produced in hydroelectric power stations on the Ntem and Ma'an rivers.|$|E

[...] A tannery was located in a building in the back and up to 1910 an inn was located in the miller's house.
