40|$|The {{performance}} of a single classifier is often inadequate in difficult classification problems. In such cases, several researchers have combined the outputs of multiple classifiers to obtain better performance. However, the amount of improvement possible through such combination techniques is generally not known. This article presents two approaches to estimating performance limits in hybrid networks. First, we present a framework that estimates Bayes error rates when linear combiners are used. Then we discuss a more general method that provides decision confidences and error bounds based <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>types</b> arising from the training data. The methods are illustrated for a difficult four class problem involving underwater acoustic data. For this data, we compute the single classifier and combiner classification performances, {{as well as the}} Bayes error rate and an error bound.

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) is {{the most}} frequent form of human genetic variations and of importance for medical diagnosis and tracking disease genes. A haplotype is a sequence of SNPs from a single copy of a chromosome, and haplotype assembly from SNP fragments is based on DNA fragments with SNPs and the methodology of shotgun sequence assembly. In contrast to conventional combinatorial models which aim at different error types in SNP fragments, {{in this paper we}} propose a new statistical model [...] a Markov chain model for haplotype assembly based on information of SNP fragments. The main advantage of this model over combinatorial ones is that it requires no prior information <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>types</b> in data. In addition, unlike exact algorithms with the exponential-time computation complexity for most combinatorial models, the proposed model can be solved in polynomial time and thus is efficient for large-scale problems.

40|$|In this study, both Bayesian {{classifiers}} {{and mutual}} information classifiers are examined for binary classifications {{with or without}} a reject option. The general decision rules in terms of distinctions <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>types</b> and reject types are derived for Bayesian classifiers. A formal analysis is conducted to reveal the parameter redundancy of cost terms when abstaining classifications are enforced. The redundancy implies an intrinsic problem of "non-consistency" for interpreting cost terms. If no data is given to the cost terms, we demonstrate the weakness of Bayesian classifiers in class-imbalanced classifications. On the contrary, mutual-information classifiers are able to provide an objective solution from the given data, which shows a reasonable balance among error types and reject types. Numerical examples of using two types of classifiers are given for confirming the theoretical differences, including the extremely-class-imbalanced cases. Finally, we briefly summarize the Bayesian classifiers and mutual-information classifiers in terms of their application advantages, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} rate, error type, causes and {{clinical}} significance of unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents reported by Welsh National Health Service (NHS) hospital pharmacies. Methods: Details of all unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents occurring over 3 months (September–December 2005) at five district general hospitals across Wales were reported and analysed using a validated method. Rates of unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Reported error types, contributory factors and clinical significance of unprevented and prevented incidents were compared using Fisher's exact test. Key findings: Thirty-five unprevented and 291 prevented dispensing incidents were reported amongst 221 670 items. The rate of unprevented (16 / 100 000 items) and prevented dispensing incidents (131 / 100 000 items; P = 0. 04) was significantly different. There {{was a significant}} difference in the proportions of prevented and unprevented dispensing incidents involving the wrong directions/warnings on the label (prevented, n = 100, 29 %; unprevented, n = 4, 10 %; P = 0. 02) and the wrong drug details on the label (prevented, n = 15, 4 %; unprevented, n = 6, 14 %; P = 0. 01). There {{was a significant difference}} in the proportions of prevented and unprevented dispensing incidents involving supply of the wrong strength (prevented, n = 46, 14 %; unprevented, n = 2, 5 %; P = 0. 02) and issue of expired medicines (prevented, n = 3, 1 %; unprevented, n = 5, 12 %; P = 0. 002). Conclusion: The use of prevented dispensing incidents as a surrogate marker for unprevented incidents is questionable. There were significant differences between unprevented and prevented dispensing incidents in terms of rate and error types. This is consistent with the medication error iceberg.

40|$|Literacy development, {{particularly}} spelling {{development is}} an important topic in SLA because spelling ability {{is the foundation of}} literacy skills (Venezky, 1989). However, {{little is known about the}} development of spelling in ESL. Research on the development of spelling skills has focused on native English language. This study investigated English L 2 spellings among Korean L 1 learners of English on the basis of linguistic differences in their L 1 and L 2 phonology and orthography. Two groups of 3 rd graders, Korean L 1 English learners (N= 36) and native English speakers (N= 30), performed a pseudoword spelling task, in which they listened to an audio recording of a total of 34 pseudowords and dictated what they heard. The task material targeting phonological difference consists of two types of pseudowords: the consonants that exist in both English and in Korean (congruent type) and the consonants that do not exist in Korean but exist English (incongruent type). The task material targeting orthographic difference consists of two types of pseudowords: more consistent vowels and less consistent vowels. Data were tested with an experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial design with “group” and “word type” as independent variables. The groups included two groups who are from contrasting L 1 backgrounds: English and Korean. For phonological difference, word type included two contrasting types: congruent and incongruent. For orthographic difference, word type included two contrasting types: more consistent and less consistent. The results support the prediction that Korean L 1 learners of English would have difficulty in spelling pseudowords containing phonemes which do not exist in Korean but are present in English phonology and that learners whose L 1 is relatively transparent had difficulty in spelling L 2 words whose grapheme phoneme correspondence is less transparent.

40|$|Background. The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a sensorimotor speech disorder in children, is both challenging and controversial. Uncertainty exists regarding the disorder’s underlying nature and its salient features. This uncertainty impacts the formulation of treatment approaches. Numerous approaches for CAS treatment have been suggested, based on different authors’ theoretical conceptualisation of the disorders’ underlying nature and its characteristic features. Research on many of these approaches report improvements in items targeted in treatment, but generalisation to untreated items and maintenance of skills varies. Factors which influence the outcomes of treatment include the treatment methods, as well as the types of targets selected. Authors tend to attribute improvements achieved by participants to the methods employed in a particular treatment. Comparatively little theoretical consideration is given to the selection of targets and the influence this has on treatment, generalisation and maintenance effects. The current study investigated the speech motor learning (SML) approach (Van der Merwe, 1985; 2011), which is based on a comprehensive speech motor planning and programming model (Van der Merwe, 1997; 2009). This model aids one in understanding the nature of CAS and predicts many of its characteristic features. Furthermore, the model provides guidelines for treatment targets in particular, but also for treatment methods. Aims. The primary aim was to determine whether the SML approach would effect a positive change in the speech production of a child with CAS, as measured by whole word accuracy. The sub-aims were to determine whether treatment effects would generalise to untreated non- and real-word stimuli containing: 1) only treated age-appropriate consonants and five vowels (Set 1 sounds); 2) in addition, untreated age-appropriate consonants and the same five vowels (Set 2 sounds); 3) in addition, untreated age-inappropriate consonants and the same five vowels (Set 3 sounds). Method. A single-case experimental design, with multiple baselines and multiple probes across behaviours was implemented. The Participant, a 33 -month old boy, presented with a cluster of CAS symptoms. He received 18 sessions of treatment according to the SML approach (Van der Merwe, 1985; 2011) over 9 weeks. Three baseline, nine treatment, and two follow-up probes were performed across the study duration. Probe stimuli comprised untreated non- and real-words containing treated (Set 1) and untreated (Set 2 : age-appropriate and Set 3 : age-inappropriate) sounds. Whole word accuracy was determined through perceptual analysis. Accuracy scores were compared through effect size (ES) calculations. A post-hoc analysis <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>types</b> was performed to explore the effect of improvement on the nature of errors across time. Results. The Participant demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of treated sounds (Set 1), while less or no change was observed in untreated age-appropriate (Set 2) and untreated age-inappropriate (Set 3) consonants respectively. The post-hoc analysis revealed a predominance of phonetic-motoric errors throughout the study. Set 3 real words showed a small increase in phonological errors, with a coinciding {{decrease in the number of}} words that were distorted to such an extent that individual sounds could not be distinguished. Conclusions. The SML approach was effective in improving the Participant’s ability to plan and coarticulate sounds, resulting in significantly improved production of treated sounds in untreated nonword exemplars and untreated real words. Generalisation of treatment gains to untreated stimuli provides support for the target selection of the SML approach, in addition to the SML methods as implemented in this study. The predominance of phonetic-motoric errors supports the notion that CAS is a disorder of motor planning and/or programming.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{distinctly}} different <b>types</b> of measurement <b>error</b> are Berkson and classical. Impacts of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of ambient air pollution {{are expected to}} depend <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>type.</b> We characterize measurement error due to instrument imprecision and spatial variability as multiplicative (i. e. additive on the log scale) and model it over a range of <b>error</b> <b>types</b> to assess impacts on risk ratio estimates both on a per measurement unit basis and on a per interquartile range (IQR) basis in a time-series study in Atlanta. Methods Daily measures of twelve ambient air pollutants were analyzed: NO 2, NO x, O 3, SO 2, CO, PM 10 mass, PM 2. 5 mass, and PM 2. 5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon and organic carbon. Semivariogram analysis was applied to assess spatial variability. Error due to this spatial variability was added to a reference pollutant time-series on the log scale using Monte Carlo simulations. Each of these time-series was exponentiated and introduced to a Poisson generalized linear model of cardiovascular disease emergency department visits. Results Measurement error resulted in reduced statistical significance for the risk ratio estimates for all amounts (corresponding to different pollutants) and <b>types</b> of <b>error.</b> When modelled as classical-type error, risk ratios were attenuated, particularly for primary air pollutants, with average attenuation in risk ratios on a per unit of measurement basis ranging from 18 % to 92 % and on an IQR basis ranging from 18 % to 86 %. When modelled as Berkson-type error, risk ratios per unit of measurement were biased away from the null hypothesis by 2 % to 31 %, whereas risk ratios per IQR were attenuated (i. e. biased toward the null) by 5 % to 34 %. For CO modelled error amount, a range of <b>error</b> <b>types</b> were simulated and effects on risk ratio bias and significance were observed. Conclusions For multiplicative error, both the amount and <b>type</b> of measurement <b>error</b> impact health effect estimates in air pollution epidemiology.

The children were between the ages of 9 and 12 years. ^ The LD groups consisted of 7 subjects with learning disorders primarily referenced to left frontal systems (LD-LF) and 18 subjects with learning disorders primarily referenced to left hemisphere systems in general (LD-LH). The tumor group consisted of 13 subjects. Subjects in the clinical groups were matched for age, sex, and handedness with the control subjects. A scoring system was devised to evaluate the production of ten <b>error</b> <b>types</b> across copy, immediate recall, and delayed recall administrations of the R-OCF. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in error production between the control group and the two clinical groups across the copy and immediate recall conditions and between the two clinical groups across the copy, immediate recall, and delayed recall conditions. ^ Problems of statistical power and sample size resulted in the elimination of the LD-LF group from the analyses. Consequently, the question of differences in error production between the LD-LF and LD-LH groups could not be answered and awaits research with a larger sample. Overall, results indicate that error analysis can reliably differentiate normal children from children in clinical groups. Children in the LD-LH and tumor groups produced significantly higher frequencies of errors in reproductions of the figure than children in the control group under copy and immediate recall conditions.

Memory stimuli comprised two or four real world objects (the memory load) presented sequentially, each for 650 ms, at random locations on a computer screen.

Participants were asked to report the name of the object presented at the cued location. Errors rates wherein participants reported the names of objects that had been presented in the memory display but not at the cued location (non-target errors) vs. objects that had not been presented at all in the memory display (non-memory errors) were compared. Significant effects of aging, memory load and target recency <b>on</b> <b>error</b> <b>type</b> and absolute <b>error</b> rates were found. Non-target error rate was higher than non-memory error rate in both age groups, indicating that VSTM may have been more often than not populated with partial traces of previously presented items. At high memory load, non-memory error rate was higher in young participants (compared to older participants) when the memory target had been presented at the earliest temporal position. However, non-target error rates exhibited a reversed trend, i. e., greater error rates were found in older participants when the memory target had been presented at the two most recent temporal positions. Data are interpreted in terms of proactive interference (earlier examined non-target items interfering with more recent items), false memories (non-memory items which have a categorical relationship to presented items, interfering with memory targets), slot and flexible resource models, and spatial coding deficits...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} our ongoing work <b>on</b> grammatical <b>error</b> correction (GEC). Focusing <b>on</b> {{all possible}} <b>error</b> <b>types</b> in a real-life environment, we propose a factored {{statistical machine translation}} (SMT) model for this task. We consider error correction {{as a series of}} language translation problems guided by various linguistic information, as factors that influence translation results. Factors included in our study are morphological information, i. e. word stem, prefix, suffix, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) information. In addition, we also experimented with different combinations of translation models (TM), phrase-based and factor-based, trained on various datasets to boost the overall performance. Empirical results show that the proposed model yields an improvement of 32. 54 % over a baseline phrase-based SMT model. The system participated in the CoNLL 2014 shared task and achieved the 7 th and 5 th F 0. 5 scores 1 on the official test set among the thirteen participating teams. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous error {{detection}} research {{focused on the}} effectiveness of different checking methods. In this paper, we focus on the psychological mechanisms <b>on</b> <b>error</b> detection. We conceptualize working memory (WM) as a critical cognitive component in {{error detection}} and two studies were carried out to investigate the effects of WM load and capacity <b>on</b> <b>error</b> detection performance and the detection of different <b>error</b> <b>types.</b> Study I found a significant interaction effect of WM load x capacity: low WM capacity participants performed significantly worse in higher WM load condition, however, high WM capacity participants 2 ̆ 7 performances were unaffected by higher WM load. Study II employed think-aloud technique to gain insights into detectable <b>error</b> <b>types</b> and generated novel predictions about the effect of WM demands <b>on</b> detecting different <b>errors.</b> These predictions allow for a new research direction in error detection...|$|R

The native speaker students of the foreign language the others were learning corrected paragraphs written by their peers. The feedback provided by each group of tutors was analyzed for (1) language corrected, (2) input <b>on</b> <b>errors,</b> and (3) <b>types</b> of feedback provided. We found that both Colombian and New Zealand tutors willingly provided corrections to their peers and used other feedback strategies to foster attention to linguistic form. The Colombian tutors identified a higher number of errors, but the New Zealanders provided more detailed comments. We draw lessons from the exploration...|$|R
30|$|The {{medication}} <b>error</b> <b>types</b> (b) ‘medication without indication’, (e) ‘double medication’, and (f) ‘wrong medication’ {{were frequently}} not identified by our CDSS. Depending <b>on</b> the medication <b>error</b> <b>type,</b> {{it can be}} reasoned why the CDSS did not find these <b>types</b> of <b>errors.</b> The medication <b>error</b> <b>type</b> (b) requires the input of the ‘indication’. In the included medication reviews only three indications for all patients where documented in the CPOE and therefore available for the CDSS. It has already been suggested that multi-morbidity from electronic health records is poorly adopted by currents CDSSs (Fraccaro et al. 2015). The reason why the medication <b>error</b> <b>types</b> (e) ‘double medication’ and (f) ‘wrong medication’ were not found by the CDSS is because these DRPs {{are not included in}} the algorithms. These DRPs are routinely screened by the physician and pharmacist in the CPOE integrated G-standard. Our CDSS has been developed to have new notifications in addition to the CPOE notifications. The appearance of the many medication <b>error</b> <b>types</b> (e) ‘double medication’ and (f) ‘wrong medication’, suggests there is a high degree of alert fatigue with regard to CPOE alerts. Alert fatigue occurs when there are a high number of non-clinically relevant alerts, which results in the overlooking of both relevant and not-relevant alerts (van der Sijs et al. 2006). The CPOE integrated G-standard has been reported to generate 5.8  % relevant drug safety alerts (Eppenga et al. 2012). The efficiency of our CDSS is much higher with a sensitivity of 72.9  % and a specificity of 98.6  %. The analysis of why the CDSS assessed DRP notifications as non-relevant or relevant, while later evaluated as relevant and non-relevant respectively, can be used to increase the efficiency of the CDSS.|$|R
40|$|For several decades, {{there has}} been a heated debate about the value of {{providing}} corrective feedback in writing assignments in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes. Despite the fact that corrective feedback in writing has been analysed from various angles, learners’ expectations regarding feedback given by language instructors are still to be considered, especially in different learning settings. Student attitudes {{have been found to be}} associated with motivation, proficiency, learner anxiety, autonomous learning, etc. (Elwood & Bode, 2014). Thus, the aim of this paper was to compare EFL learners’ attitudes towards corrective feedback and self-evaluation of writing skills in different learning settings. Students at two technological universities in France and Lithuania were surveyed and asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire combining the Likert scale and rank order questions. The results indicate that frequency of writing assignments seems to have little or no impact on students’ self-evaluation of writing skills. Moreover, although the two groups of students showed preference for feedback <b>on</b> different <b>error</b> <b>types</b> (e. g., feedback on structure vs. feedback on grammar), nevertheless, indirect corrective feedback with a clue was favoured by all the respondents...|$|R
