5|$|The {{name of the}} bastion {{refers to}} {{the faces of the}} {{fortification}} and not to the slope of the ground on which it was built; Flat Bastion was constructed on sloping ground. A 1908 map of the Flat Bastion confirms that its south faces join at an <b>obtuse</b> <b>angle</b> which is relatively flat, and nearly parallel to the Charles V Wall. Flat Bastion includes Flat Bastion Magazine within its eastern portion, now a geological research and exhibition facility. The bastion is a listed building with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. While St. Jago's Bastion has been said to be an early name for Flat Bastion, it has a separate listing with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, next to those for Flat Bastion and Flat Bastion Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very <b>obtuse</b> <b>angle,</b> with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils.

Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E

40|$|This project treats {{a classic}} problem in {{combinatorial}} geometry: {{the study of}} <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> (angles larger than pi/ 2 radians) {{in a set of}} points on the plane. The main question is: What is the minimum number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> that are determined by any set of n points? This problem was studied by Conway, Croft, Erdös and Guy in their work "On the distribution of values of angles determined by coplanar points" in the year 1979, where they could determine bounds on the minimum number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> among all point clouds with n points. This thesis presents a computational approach to the problem. In the first place, these proofs of Conway et al. are discussed. Furthermore, a program to verify the good quality of these bounds has been implemented. Also the expected number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> in a random point set, which was determined by E. Langford in 1970, is confirmed by means of experiments. The central part of the project studies the effect of geometrical transformations on the number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> in a given point cloud. The considered functions include: the Möbius transformation, the exponential function, and the shear transformation, among others. We present experimental results on the question: Which of the considered transformations tend to decrease the number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles,</b> if applied to a random point set? Also, we study the degree of reduction of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles,</b> which measures by how much the number of <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> can be decreased if a specific transformation is applied to a point cloud. Finally, we combine some of the considered transformations in order to generate point clouds with few <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles.</b> The different experiments in this project have been carried out with the program MATLAB.

The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back.

40|$|Abstract—Shapes on picture {{surfaces}} are not seen accurately (Arnheim, 1954). In particular, if they depict 3 -D forms, angles between lines on a picture surface are misperceived.

Each quadrilateral was shown alone {{or as part of}} a drawing of a cube. The drawings showed the tops of the cubes, tilted at various angles around a horizontal axis. This generated different acute and <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> in the drawings. Compared to a quadrilateral on its own, judgments of the acute and <b>obtuse</b> <b>angles</b> in the cube drawings were biased towards 90 ◦.

A right or acute angle would indicate a head held high for browsing leaves at various heights. Elasmotherium had the most <b>obtuse</b> <b>angle</b> of the Rhinocerotids.

25|$|<b>Obtuse</b> <b>Angle</b> – {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} based on James Parker, Blake’s fellow apprentice during his time with Basire. George Mills Harper, however, believes that Angle is instead based on Thomas Taylor (Harper agrees with Erdman that Sipsop is not based on Taylor but on William Henry Mathew). Harper argues that Angle seems to be an educator, and his relationship with many of the other characters is that of a teacher and student. This is significant because there is evidence that Blake took lessons in Euclid under Taylor, hence Angle's apparent role as teacher. Erdman supports this theory. Rawlinson suggests that Angle may be partially based on Blake's friend George Cumberland, as well as the antiquarian Francis Douce.|$|E

25|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{is a statement}} of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra (2006) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), Zupaysaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the maxillary fenestra is within the antorbital fossa (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the rostral process of the lacrimal is ventrally bowed (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the ventral process of the squamosal is kinked (according to Ezcurra, 2006), wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (according to Ezcurra, 2006). The maxillary-jugal ventral margin describes an <b>obtuse</b> <b>angle</b> in lateral view (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a notch on the dorsal margin of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal ramus of the lacrimal is rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the ascending process of the maxilla; (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a lacrimal with a highly pneumatized antorbital recess (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a short and square-shaped retroarticular process of the mandible (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), the cnemial crest is poorly developed (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006).|$|E
