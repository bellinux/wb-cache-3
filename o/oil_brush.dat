50|$|Lynd Kendall Ward (June 26, 1905 - June 28, 1985) was an American {{artist and}} storyteller, {{known for his}} series of wordless novels using wood engraving, and his {{illustrations}} for juvenile and adult books. His wordless novels have influenced {{the development of the}} graphic novel. Strongly associated with his wood engravings, he also worked in watercolor, <b>oil,</b> <b>brush</b> and ink, lithography and mezzotint. Ward was a son of Methodist minister and political organizer Harry F. Ward.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to woodcuts, Ward also worked in watercolor, <b>oil,</b> <b>brush</b> and ink, lithography and mezzotint. Ward illustrated {{over a hundred}} children's books, several of which were collaborations with his wife, May. Starting in 1938, Ward became a frequent illustrator of the Heritage Limited Editions Club's series of classic works. He was well known for the political themes of his artwork, often addressing labor and class issues. In 1932 he founded Equinox Cooperative Press. He {{was a member of}} the Society of Illustrators, the Society of American Graphic Arts, and the National Academy of Design.|$|E

50|$|Neatsfoot oil {{is often}} used to <b>oil</b> sign-writers' <b>brushes</b> that have been used in {{oil-based}} paint, as this oil is non drying and can be easily washed out with solvent at any time. <b>Oiling</b> the <b>brushes</b> reduces the buildup of pigment in the ferrule, the metal part that many brushes have to hold the hairs in place.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} forms of {{refractive}} surgery, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially referred to as 'dry eye,' {{is the most common}} complication of PRK, and can be permanent. In more advanced cases, recurrent erosions occur during sleeping from adherence of the corneal epithelium to the upper eyelid with rapid eye movement. Adjuvant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with high Omega-3 content before and after surgery improves sicca, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Foods containing PUFAs include flax and fish <b>oil.</b> <b>Brush</b> PRK to denude the epithelium, instead of alcohol based techniques, also result in quantitatively lower ocular dryness after surgery. The amount of corneal hazing after surgery is also decreased with brush technique. The platelet activating factor LAU-0901 has shown effect in mitigating dry eye in mouse models. Rabbit models have also shown improvement with topical nerve growth factor (NGF) in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Mitomycin C worsens post-surgical dry eye.|$|E
40|$|Brush seals {{are used}} in gas Turbine engine {{applications}} for their effectiveness in controlling leakage flows between stationary parts and rotating shaft With their superior leakage performance, they are becoming the successor to the labyrinth seals, which have always been widely used since the first gas turbine engines. After gaining popularity in secondary flow air sealing, applications extended to more challenging oil and oil mist sealing locations. Due to high rotor surface speed oil temperature rise and coking become main issues in addition to leakage performance. While each bristle forms very small bearing surface. high rotor surface speed and viscous sealing medium provide sufficient hydrodynamic lift force to overcome bristle reaction forces. The gap generated between the bristle tips and the rotor surface determines the oil temperature rise and leakage rate. Due to shear thinning in oil sealing applications lift force is inversely correlated to oil temperature rise leading to a self-balancing effect with surface speed. The aim of a proper design for <b>oil</b> <b>brush</b> seals would be to keep the leakage at the minimum rate while avoiding excess oil temperature rise. Inherent complexity of bristles make calculation of hydrodynamic lift forces under a brush seal rather complicated. To avoid costly experimental investigations, a closed form analytical solution would prove very useful to compare candidate designs and to study what-if scenarios. This work investigates analytical solutions to hydrodynamic- lift clearance and bristle lift forces based on bearing theory. After a detailed discussion on short bearing approach, possible closed form solutions based on long bearing approach have been explored. A more comprehensive yet numerical solution based on finite beating approach has also been provided to compare and understand pressure and lifting force results. Analyses have been performed for effective constant oil viscosity. Shear thinning effect has been later introduced through use of published oil temperature data for various rotor surface speeds. As bristle tip clearance data are not available, validity of analytical {{the results have been}} evaluated using beam bending forces and experimental leakage flow data for various surface speeds. The results indicate that long bearing solution underestimates the oil lift force. Although more comprehensive, finite bearing solution requires the knowledge of axial deflection/bloom of the bristle pack. Simple yet functional, short bearing solution appears as a viable tool for seal designers to compare various seal designs before doing detail experimental evaluation on a plausible candidate. Finally, possible further work areas have been discussed...|$|E

50|$|After a thousand-year abeyance, wigs {{came back}} into fashion in western Europe from the 16th century onwards, boosted in {{particular}} by King Louis XIV of France in the 17th and early 18th centuries.

A burgeoning trade in hair products included all the tools needed to maintain elaborate hairstyles - curling sticks, crimping irons, creams, soaps, <b>oils,</b> <b>brushes,</b> pins and so on. The increasing ornateness of formal hairstyles required many to supplement their natural hair with extensions, or to use wigs instead, created by commercial wig-makers.|$|R

First the rice is soaked in water and dried in shade and ground into a fine powder when the rice is 3/4th dried and retains some moisture. For adding sweet [...] "vellam" [...] (jaggery)is melted in water by boiling it till it reaches 'soft ball' consistency (235° F-240° F, if using a candy thermometer) and added to the rice flour along with some powdered cardamom to make a thick dough. It is then transferred to an earthenware pot and the top of the pot is closed with a thin white cloth. It is then allowed to ferment for about 3-5 days by placing it in the sunlight during the day time. Finally when the batter is ready for preparation, small balls of the dough is taken and flattened using fingers in a small piece of <b>oil</b> <b>brushed</b> banana leaf and deep fried in oil until golden brown. Then it is pressed with a flat bottomed bowl to remove the excess oil.|$|R

50|$|Artists in Zambia {{are faced}} with particular, though assuredly not unique, challenges. Even today, {{materials}} such as <b>oil</b> paints, <b>brushes,</b> canvas {{still have to be}} imported from South Africa and this makes them prohibitively expensive.

40|$|Retention wires {{permanently}} {{bonded to}} the anterior teeth are used after orthodontic treatment {{to prevent the}} teeth from relapsing to pre-treatment positions. A disadvantage of bonded retainers is biofilm accumulation on the wires, which produces {{a higher incidence of}} gingival recession, increased pocket depth and bleeding on probing. This study compares in vivo biofilm formation on single-strand and multi-strand retention wires with different oral health-care regimens. Two-centimetre wires were placed in brackets that were bonded to the buccal side of the first molars and second premolars in the upper arches of 22 volunteers. Volunteers used a selected toothpaste with or without the additional use of a mouthrinse containing essential <b>oils.</b> <b>Brushing</b> was performed manually. Regimens were maintained for 1 week, after which the wires were removed and the oral biofilm was collected to quantify the number of organisms and their viability, determine the microbial composition and visualize the bacteria by electron microscopy. A 6 -week washout period was employed between regimens. Biofilm formation was reduced on single-strand wires compared with multi-strand wires; bacteria were observed to adhere between the strands. The use of antibacterial toothpastes marginally reduced the amount of biofilm on both wire types, but significantly reduced the viability of the biofilm organisms. Additional use of the mouthrinse did not result in significant changes in biofilm amount or viability. However, major shifts in biofilm composition were induced by combining a stannous fluoride- or triclosan-containing toothpaste with the mouthrinse. These shifts can be tentatively attributed to small changes in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity after the adsorption of the toothpaste components, which stimulate bacterial adhesion to the hydrophobic oil, as illustrated for a Streptococcus mutans strain...|$|R
