5|$|The society debated an {{extensive}} range <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> social topics, often violating {{its own rules}} which banned religious and political subjects. Even though its membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region, and the organization greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise {{them away from the}} wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged.|$|E

40|$|The image {{prevailing}} {{among the}} public <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> research <b>and</b> researchers constitutes a contradictory and complex combination of traditional stereotypes. We explore central facets of the image <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> research <b>and</b> researchers as reflected in Greek adolescent students' drawings. Drawings were produced by 171 students participating in a drawing competition launched {{in the context of}} the "Researchers' Night 2007 " implemented by three research institutions in Greece. Analysis of students' drawings involved dimensions related to the image <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> researchers <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> research. Outcomes indicate that the students hold fairly outdated views <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> researchers <b>and</b> their activity, involving stereotypic views of scientists and science, as well as gender stereotypes. Therefore there is an urgent need to promote a more relevant image <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> researchers <b>and</b> their activity to young people and especially students...|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} and description of new species and {{the collection of}} specimens became a passion <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> gentlemen <b>and</b> a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> knowledge <b>and</b> adventure.|$|R
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|Siddiqui studied {{philosophy}} at Aligarh Muslim University and later studied chemistry at Frankfurt University, {{where he received}} his PhD in 1927.

He later moved to Pakistan and worked in the Pakistan Council <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Industrial Research and went on to establish the Pakistan National Science Council and was appointed as its first chairman in 1961.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} challenges for art historians {{in establishing the}} names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only {{as a result of}} decades <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.|$|E
5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E

From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to 1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food flood protection research committee. Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Placzek became {{head of the}} {{theoretical}} physics division. Kowarski was designated {{to be the head}} of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir Edward Appleton, the permanent secretary of the British Department <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Industrial Research, of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for James Chadwick. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist Jules Guéron, who had been working for Free France at Cambridge, and Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian scientist who had worked with Enrico Fermi in Italy before the war.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E
