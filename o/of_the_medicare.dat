5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Paul {{went against}} the {{majority}} of Republicans and voted to block implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Part D program, which expanded Medicare {{to cover the costs}} of medications for the elderly and disabled, and which prohibited the government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to try to get lower prices for the covered medications. In 2007, he again {{went against the}} majority of House Republicans when he voted with all of the Democrats in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which, if enacted, would have given the government the authority to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices with the manufacturers.

We estimate behavioral responses in <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> population and incorporate the estimates into a micro-simulation model which uses data that are representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>Medicare</b> population.

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> program, CMS (that {{was not always}} {{the name of the}} responsible bureaucracy) has contracted with private insurance companies to operate as intermediaries between the government and medical providers to administer Part A and Part B benefits.

Beginning in 1997 and 2005 respectively, these and other insurance companies also began administering Part C and Part D plans.|$|E

25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending {{as a share of}} gross domestic product (GDP), the solvency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> {{beneficiaries}} {{who are not}} dual {{eligible for}} both Medicare (around 20%) and Medicaid or that do not receive supplemental insurance via a former employer (40%) or a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan (about 30%), almost all elect to purchase a type of private supplemental insurance coverage, called a Medigap plan (20%), to help fill in the financial holes in Original Medicare (Part A and B). Note that the percentages add up to over 100% because many beneficiaries {{have more than one}} type of supplement. These Medigap insurance policies are standardized by CMS, but are sold and administered by private companies. Some Medigap policies sold before 2006 may include coverage for prescription drugs. Medigap policies sold after the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006 are prohibited from covering drugs. Medicare regulations prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from being sold both a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan and a private Medigap Policy. As with public Part C health plans, private Medigap policies are only available to beneficiaries who are already signed up for benefits from Original Medicare Part A and Part B. These policies are regulated by state insurance departments rather than the federal government though CMS outlines what the various Medigap plans must cover at a minimum. Therefore, the types and prices of Medigap policies vary widely from state to state and the degree of underwriting, open enrollment and guaranteed issue also varies widely from state to state.|$|E

500|$|Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton health economist, wrote. [...] "The rigid, {{artificial}} rules {{under which}} the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation", but {{went on to say}} [...] "But even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit, I doubt that the financing of this bill will be anywhere near as fiscally irresponsible as was the financing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Modernization Act of 2003." [...] Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO director during the George W. Bush administration, who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.|$|E
500|$|The CBO {{reported}} in several studies that the ACA {{would reduce the}} deficit, and that repealing it would increase the deficit. The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period: it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction. The CBO separately predicted that {{while most of the}} spending provisions do not begin until 2014, revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years. The CBO claimed that the bill would [...] "substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs"—ultimately extending the solvency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> trust fund by 8 years.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to provide {{estimates}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> basing Medicaid physician payment levels on <b>the</b> new resource-based <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule. Two possible policy options are considered: setting all Medicaid physician fees at <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule level and setting only office visit fees at <b>the</b> new <b>Medicare</b> levels. METHODS. Data on Medicaid physician fees, use patterns, and <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule are used to develop state-level estimates of expenditure changes under each option. RESULTS. Setting Medicaid rates at <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule level could increase expenditures by $ 3. 2 to $ 4. 1 billion nationally; the other option would result in substantially lower increases in expenditures. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current variations in Medicaid physician fees and in <b>the</b> breadth <b>of</b> eligibility across states, <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> adopting <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule varies considerably among states. CONCLUSIONS. Adopting <b>the</b> new <b>Medicare</b> Fee Schedule for Medicaid payments, proposed by policy-makers as a way to increase access to appropriate medical care, could double physician expenditures in some states. Adoption of more limited versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fee schedule might achieve some access gains at lower costs...|$|R
