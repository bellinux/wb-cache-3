40|$|This map is {{inspired}} by the 2013 subsidized housing unit density dataset published on MetroGIS datafinder catalog. It improves upon the spatial resolution of the original dataset, which aggregates raw count data by census track enumeration unit, by aggregating normalized density data (# of subsidized rental unit / total # of rental unit) at the census block group level. And with the availability of individual addresses of properties that contain subsidized rental units, the density value distribution is further restricted to individual land use parcels at a sub-census-block-group spatial level.

30|$|Statistical {{characteristics}} of compressed audio/video data are dramatically {{different from the}} ones of text data, because the variable-length codes and other processes used in compression remove the redundant information from the <b>original</b> <b>data.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis in [12] shows that the coded data have high randomness at the byte level. Based on this statistical characteristic of media data, we extend the idea of VEA algorithm to a new method that uses traditional block cipher to encrypt a part of data (part I), and uses its plaintext as the stream cipher key to encrypt another part of data (part II). By changing the ratio between parts I and II, we can adjust {{the speed of the}} encryption algorithm.|$|R

After the trend associated with biological factors related to increasing age has been removed and all variables have been standardized, some statistical parameters have been computed and a variance analysis has been performed. After the persistence has been eliminated, an original technique of multiple regression on the principal components and of selection of the most significant variables has been built. Twenty -four climatic variables have been used. The principal aim {{of this paper is to}} describe this <b>original</b> <b>statistical</b> technique of <b>data</b> analysis and to illustrate its power with dendroclimatological data in Morocco. For the temperate site located in low altitude (1280 m), among the most important variables, we have retained total monthly precipitation for August, mean temperature of January, April, and May of the current year and mean temperature of October of the previous year.

Since current theories on non-profit location choice tend to neglect such tendencies, this article develops an evolutionary economic geography approach to non-profit organizations. It focuses on increasing returns to scale, labor mobility and path dependence and contextualizes those factors. A survey involving visual ranking methods of OECD-based development NGOs and structured field-level interviews with local NGOs in the Central African Republic and Tanzania provide <b>original</b> empirical <b>data.</b> <b>Statistical</b> methods {{are used to}} contrast the divergent experiences in the two countries. The article concludes that the increased interest of international NGOs in Tanzania and their continued {{lack of interest in}} the Central African Republic are self-perpetuating processes that explain the concentration of NGOs. This concentration may lead to increased efficiency, but reduces the equitable distribution of NGO aid and therefore has implications for the attainment of global poverty goals. economic geography; clusters; NGO; aid; Tanzania, Central African Republic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} urban-rural {{inequality}} of opportunity in health care in China based on Roemer’s (1998) theory of equality of opportunity (EOp). Following the compensation principle proposed by Fleurbaey and Schokkaert (2011), this paper establishes a decomposition strategy of the fairness gap which we use to measure the urban-rural {{inequality of opportunity}} in health care in China. Empirical analysis using the CHNS data shows that the ratios of the urban-rural fairness gap to the urban-rural average difference {{in the use of}} health care are 1. 167 during 1997 - 2000 and 1. 744 during 2004 - 2006, which indicates that the urban-rural average difference observed directly from <b>original</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> may underestimate the degree of the essential inequity. Meanwhile, the increasing fairness gap and the decomposition results imply that generally leveling the urban-rural reimbursement ratios is probably not sufficient, and pro-disadvantage policies should be put in place in order to mitigate or even eliminate the inequality of opportunity in health care between urban and rural residents. This implication is also illuminating for the experiments and the establishment of the urban-rural integrated medical insurance system (URIMIS) in China. Under the background of the dual social structure and the evident income gap between the urban and the rural, the pro-disadvantage policies will be more appreciated and effective in the promotion of the equality of opportunity in health care. And such positive role of the pro-disadvantage policies is supported by data from URIMIS pilot districts in Jiangsu province. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this contribution is to present the final results of a long-term research project which aimed at constructing an input-output table for Germany in 1936. Our research {{can be seen as}} follow-up of the activities of the German Imperial Statistical Office (Statistisches Reichsamt) which worked on a “matrix of economic interdependencies” (Volkswirtschaftliche erflechtungstabelle) for Germany as early as in the thirties of the last century. The symmetric table for 1936 is completely based on <b>original</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> and does not refer to separate supply and use tables. The input-output table for Germany in 1936 covers 40 branches. This paper depicts its aggregated version with 13 sectors, five final demand categories and five primary inputs. Government is placed as an intermediate sector into quadrant I. In quadrant II it appears with only one figure (government gross production minus fees for specific government services). Government is delimitated into three subsectors as can be seen from Table 1 : public administration, military spending and social security. In addition, public investment for civilian purposes is assigned to the investment vector of quadrant II. Military expenditure, however, is treated as government consumption and not as investment. The input-output table offers a new benchmark for gross domestic product and thus income, expenditure and production of the German Empire in 1936. We found a comparably high level of GDP and a significantly higher mixed income/operating surplus which confirms rudimentary and qualitative evidence on exceptionally high incomes and hidden profits of armament industry. Due to our unique production approach of calculating GDP these hidden profits could be revealed. ...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} problem that macroeconomic indicators calculated for different countries are not directly comparable if the <b>original</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> are expressed in different prices. The artificial prices, computable from input-output models, can provide quite a solid ground for the comparison of otherwise incomparable economic indicators. The main {{purpose of this paper}} was to disprove the assertion of Jerzy Osiatynski that it cannot be theoretically proven that the two-level system of prices used in East European countries, creates a systematic price bias in the macroeconomic indicators. Osiatynski correctly pointed out that the problem is much more complicated than it is usually believed. The main complication results {{from the fact that the}} imposition of indirect tax influences not only the level of prices, but also relative prices. Nevertheless, he was wrong in claiming that the change in relative prices is absolutely unpredictable and that there is an equal chance for each indicator to be biased upward or downward - except in the case of “labor-value prices”. In fact the price bias can be easily detected and measured not only at “labor-value prices”, but also at some other types of prices. The extent and direction of price bias can be empirically measured by decomposing the bias into two parts: the part which is due to the changes in relative prices, and the part which is due to the differences in the levels of retail and wholesale prices. This paper also shows that certain macroeconomic indicators can be made internationally comparable without recalculating statistics of the involved countries into the same price system. It is sufficient to measure the indicators at their own artificially computed price vectors or on the specially standardized output vectors. It is also suggested that the dominant characteristic roots of certain matrices may serve as the best unbiased measures of basic macroeconomic indicators.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} performance {{movement has}} tended to assume that a key to restoring public trust in the civil service lies in a focus on outcomes or results—what government is doing to solve real problems and improve people’s lives. If government can better deliver and demonstrate key outcomes, so the thinking goes, citizens will recognize these accomplishments and reward the public sector with an outpouring of trust. But there is growing evidence from various fields that people’s trust in institutions of authority often depends more on process than on outcomes. This finding that process matters {{in the formation of}} trust judgments appears across a wide range of settings (police, courts, work places), yet it has not been adequately recognized in the public administration literature and rhetoric on government performance—especially in the current era of outcomes-based, results-driven government. This paper presents an <b>original</b> <b>statistical</b> analysis of <b>data</b> from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP), the World Bank Governance Indicators, and the UN Human Development Index to test the relative influence of process versus outcomes on the perceived trustworthiness of the civil service across nations. Both individual-level and country-level analysis suggest that indicators of process, such as fairness and rule of law, predict trust of the civil service much more strongly than do indicators of outcomes (such as health, public safety, education, and economic well being). Implications for the performance movement and for public administration research are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{research}} fields of exploring valuable information from the large number of collected <b>data.</b> Applying <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining techniques in several fields like medicine, bioinformatics, business, and bacteriology can be beneficial. Among them, bacteriology {{is one of the}} promising fields where <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining is hardly ever used. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the contribution of <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining in the field of bacteriology. The research problem named as bacterial identification from bacteriology that we handle in this paper is a special kind of classification problem of <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining where the only single representation of every class is present in the dataset. After studying this research problem, this paper proposes a novel <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining approach using the decision tree technique in bacterial identification with better performance. The experimental results show significantly less number of biochemical tests are needed in bacterial identification using this proposed approach than the conventional approach that is being followed currently in the biochemical laboratory. Thus, the proposed approach not only benefits microbiologists, but it also improves the traditional approach of bacterial identification by saving time, total cost, and manual labour involvements. <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> mining; SDM; biology; bacteriology; bioinformatics; classification; decision tree; bacterial identification. ...|$|R

Combining knowledge from case-study literature with <b>original</b> analyses of <b>statistical</b> <b>data,</b> this book presents an institutional analysis of specialized clusters of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, showing the considerable diversity of forms they take. Many modes of governance - certain forms of market, cooperation among themselves, joining associations, networking with larger firms located in the same area, or making use of local facilities provided by governmental or other external agencies - enable small firms to become part of local production systems. The international comparison shows that such patterns of governance can often be attributed to national differences. While the importance of local production systems is increasing, their most rapidly growing form - groups of small suppliers which depend on a major customer firm - may undermine their autonomous capacities in the future. 1 Patrick Le Galès and Helmut Voelzkow: Introduction: The Governance of Local Economies 2 Andrés Rodriguez-Pose: Local Production Systems and Economic Performance in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom 3 Luigi Burroni and Carlo Trigilia: Italy: Economic Development through Local Economies 4 Ulrich Glassmann and Helmut Voelzkow: The Governance of Local Economies in Germany 5 Valeria Aniello and Patrick Le Galès: Between Large Firms and Marginal Local Economies: The Making of Systems of Local Governance in France 6 Colin Crouch and Henry Farrell: Great Britain: Falling through the Holes in the Network Concept 7 Colin Crouch and Carlo Trigilia: Conclusions: Still Local Economies in Global Capitalism...|$|R
