[...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Features of the {{requirement}} to disclose <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> {{raise questions about the}} usefulness of these disclosures in practice. Despite these concerns, I provide evidence that disclosing the dollar amount of <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> in the 10 -K has several implications for firms in the manufacturing sector. On average, firms that disclose <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> have significantly higher forward earnings response coefficients and greater investment efficiency. These effects, however, are concentrated amongst firms for which <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> {{is expected to be a}} stronger signal of demand (i. e., firms that follow more of a make-to-order business model). Disclosers also have less persistent operating profitability when <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> is a relatively more important signal of demand, suggesting that although <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> can provide useful information for valuation and monitoring purposes, it can also influence competitors’ product market and investment decisions. The results should be of interest to regulators as they examine Regulation S-K disclosure requirements, and firms and standard setters as they prepare for greater forward-looking revenue disclosures under ASC 60...|$|R

40|$|Information on <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> {{has been}} {{disclosed}} in the notes of financial statements since 1970; however, {{it is not}} clear whether financial markets understand its importance. We show that almost all information in <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> is in its change, to which the stock market substantially underreacts. In this paper, we decompose changes in earnings into sales growth and changes in profitability. We find that the stock market partially understands the implication of changes in <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> on future sales growth, but not on future profitability. As a result, a hedge portfolio constructed on the change in <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> earns significantly positive returns on average. A further investigation suggests that the results are consistent with a market mispricing explanation. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes whether {{the quality of}} earnings concept can be usefully employed in the security analysis of defense contractors. Background is provided by an extensive {{review of the literature}} relevant to quality of earnings. Since the quality of earnings concept is very subjective, specific quantitative measures of quality of earnings are developed and used in a statistical analysis to validate the variables as explanatory predictors of a firm's price earnings (P/E) ratio. The statistical techniques employed include Pearson's Product Moment Correlation, Spearman's Rank Order Correlation, stepwise regression and other multiple linear regression models. Results of the study suggest that there are significant relationships between several hypothesized quality of earnings variables and a firm's P/E ratio. The statistically significant variables in the final regression models explain between 67. 8 % and 76. 6 % of the variation in the P/E ratio. The evidence indicates that variables related to cash flow, degree of government business, <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> and earnings stability reflect aspects of a firm's quality of earnings.

Because of the vital yet specialized {{nature of that}} market, {{the health of the}} ADI should be assessed periodically to enable government and industry leaders to understand clearly how and to what extent changes to its capacities and capabilities can be forecast and incorporated in their policy deliberations for better decisions. It is widely assumed that changes in defense spending will affect ADI market health, but in fact, our research indicates that although true for four decades after 1950, the comfortable predictive connection between ADI equity valuations and defense spending underwent changes with the shift in ADI industry structure for the largest companies in the 1990 s, and can challenge interpretation even at present. The role of large company <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> appears to significantly mediate the modern predictive relationship.

40|$|As {{aerospace}} Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM's) <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> soar {{to between}} six {{to ten years}} and growing, the community sees automation as vital to increasing throughput. Yet the community seems divided on the quantifiable financial benefits. While automation in aerospace assembly dates back to 1937, there is little substantive research on quantifying its business case. This thesis develops a financial model that predicts the benefit of introducing automation into an OEM's manual assembly line. The hypothesis of this project is that there is, in fact, a quantifiable benefit to implementing assembly automation into a current manual assembly process. Based on an initial automation capital investment, the financial model calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) of an aerospace automation project given various OEM production inputs such as: the annual production schedule, learning curve metrics, labor hour savings through automation, rework, health & safety metrics, and automation operating and downtime costs. A current program {{was used as a}} case study against the financial model. One significant finding is the effect production learning has on the labor hours saved from automation introduced in this thesis as the 'Efficiency Factor'. Based on the OEM's conservative production data and an initial automation investment of $ 12 M the NPV for the project is about $ 16 M for the firm order (600 ship sets) and about $ 27 M for the entire program (2000 ship sets). by Sean Michael Caetano.

40|$|Performance {{indicators}} {{have been}} assuming {{an increasingly important}} role in the nuclear industry. An integrated methodology is proposed in this research for the identification and validation of performance indicators for assessing and predicting nuclear power plant overall performance (i. e., both economic and safety performance) in a systematic and quantitative way. The methodology consists of four steps: the selection of target sites/plants, the identification and refinement of candidate indicators, the collection of historical operating records of selected indicators, and the identification and evaluation of correlations between selected indicators and plant performance through data analysis. The methodology is centered upon individual plants, using plant-specific operation records to identify and validate plant-specific correlations. It can also be applied to multiple plants and the results from different plants can be compared to identify and analyze commonalities and differences in plant operations across-plant. Case studies of the proposed methodology were performed at three target plants. A list of candidate performance indicators was identified through a sensitivity analysis on a quantitative model of nuclear power plant operation. The list was validated and supplemented through interviews with plant personnel and a refined, plant-specific list was obtained for each target plant. Historical operating records of candidate indicators in the lists were collected from target plants. Data analyses, including correlational analysis, multivariate regression analysis, and lead/lag time analysis, were performed using the historical data collected. (cont.) The methodology was originally intended for the identification of leading indicators, which can provide advance warnings of deterioration of performance before the direct outcome indicators are affected. A regression-based lead/lag time analysis method was proposed and applied in the case studies to evaluate lead/lag relationships between candidate indicators and plant performance. However, the method did not produce stable and reliable results by using the data currently available at the target plants and was not able to identify leading indicators with certainty. As a result, we shifted the focus of our data analysis to identifying correlations between candidate indicators and plant performance through correlational analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Several findings are noteworthy: (1) Data analysis results were sensitive to the indicators and data points used, mainly due to the small number of data points (30 - 60) available for use in the analyses; (2) Data analysis results generally agreed with our knowledge and expectation, with a few exceptions; (3) Correlations showed large variations from plant to plant; (4) Correlations varied from time to time at most target plants; (5) The outcome indicators with smoother patterns (e. g., the INPO performance index) tended to correlate better with candidate indicators than the outcome indicators that measured relatively rare events and had sharp changes in their patterns (e. g., unplanned capability loss factor); (6) Work <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> stood out as important indicators for all three target plants; [...] . by Yu Sui.
