40|$|Abstract: The {{integral}} water reactor design (i. e. {{a design}} where all primary system components—steam generators, pumps, pressurizer and even control rod drive mechanisms–are within the reactor vessel) is presented here. A background {{discussion of how}} integral designs were introduced in the 1990 s is provided, followed by a description {{of one of those}} designs, the safe integral reactor (SIR). The rest of the article is then devoted to the international reactor innovative and secure (IRIS) which is currently being developed by an international consortium led by Westinghouse and including 20 þ members from 10 nations. In discussing how IRIS has furthered the integral reactor concept, the design characteristics of IRIS are described along with its unique approach to safety, which focuses on exploiting the integral configuration to eliminate by design the occurrence of accidents in lieu of coping with their consequences. The IRIS safety approach is so successful that seven of eight class IV accidents (the accidents that could eventually lead to a radioactive release to the environment) typical of loop PWRs are either eliminated or downgraded, and thus it is being considered to pursue the licensing of IRIS without the requirement for <b>off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> response.

40|$|Abstract (max. 2000 char.) : In the {{framework}} of the DAONEM project (Data Assimilation for <b>Off-site</b> Nuclear <b>Emergency</b> Management), a data assimilation module, ADUM (Atmospheric Dispersion Updating Module), for the mesoscale atmospheric dispersion program RIMPUFF (Risø Mesoscale Puff model) – part of the early-phase programs of RODOS (Realtime Online DecisiOn Support system for nuclear emergencies) – has been developed. It is built on the Kalman filtering algorithm and it assimilates 10 -minute averaged gamma dose rates measured at ground level stations. Since the gamma rates are non-linear functions of the state vector variables, the applied Kalman filter is the so-called Extended Kalman filter. In more ways the implementation is non standard: 1) the number of state vector variables varies with time, and 2) the state vector variables are prediction updated with 1 -minute time steps but only Kalman filtered every 10 minutes, and this based on time averaged measurements. Given reasonable conditions, i. e. a spatially dense distribution of gamma monitors and a realistic wind field, the developed ADUM module is found to be able to enhance the prediction of the gamma dose field. Based on some of the Kalman filtering parameters, another module, ToDeMM, has been developed for providing the late-phase DeMM (Deposition Monitoring Module) of RODOS with an ensemble of fields of ground level air concentrations and wet deposited material. This accounts for the uncertainty estimation of this kind of quantities as calculated by RIMPUFF for use by DeMM. Risø-R- 1466 (EN...|$|R

Various pathways of radionuclide transport to human body are taken into account including local, regional or national specific features of the problem. Primary concern is given to localisation of atmospheric, hydrological and food-chain and dose modules of European decision support system RODOS. Main endpoint is to achieve harmonisation of the <b>off-site</b> nuclear <b>emergency</b> management methodology with EU conventions and integration of the Czech Republic within international cooperation. Status of customisation of the RODOS system is shortly described with accent on online connection with meteorological data.

The functional support provided to NASA by DOE included the Advance Launch Support Group (ALSG). If there had been a launch anomaly, the ALSG would have provided a level of radiological emergency response support adequate to transition into a Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC). Additional functional radiological emergency response support, as part of the ALSG, included the: (1) Aerial Measurement System (AMS); (2) Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC); (3) Geographic Information System (GIS); (4) Emergency Response Data System (ERDS); (5) Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site (REAC/TS); (6) Field monitoring and sampling; (7) Radioanalysis via RASCAL; (8) Source recovery; and (9) Neutron dosimetry and communications support.

40|$|Development {{of tools}} {{for use in}} the fast, online {{diagnosis}} of an event or an accident, and in the subsequent radiological source term forecasting at nuclear power plants, is increasingly desired by <b>off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> planning and response personnel. In this thesis the framework for such a tool for Swedish Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) is developed. Bayesian belief networks (BBN) are used to model severe accident progression in a generic Swedish PWR. The advantage of using the BBN methodology is that meaningful results can be obtained despite missing information. By adding observable information, e. g. pressure, water level and activity measurements in certain plant compartments the most probable plant state, in case of a severe accident, will be predicted. The plant states will all have an associated environmental source term, i. e. the quantity, characteristics and timing of the release of radioactivity to the environment. The starting points of this thesis are two previously developed BBN models for accident progression in one specific Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) and one generic PWR. These two models provide significant input to the model developed in this master's thesis. Beyond examination of the previously developed models, investigation of plant specific information for the Swedish PWRs has been a key part when modelling the BBN.

40|$|The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) Charter envisions {{the safe}} and {{reliable}} operation of nuclear systems as an essential priority in the development of next-generation systems. Safety and reliability goals broadly consider operations, improved accident management and minimization of consequences, investment protection, and reduced need for <b>off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> response. This emphasis on enhanced safety and reliability has been duly reflected in the Policy Group’s selection of the system designs, as well as in recognition of the need to establish in 2004 a system cross cutting methodology working group on Risk and Safety (RSWG). The group was charged with the responsibility to promote a homogeneous approach to safety and quality in the design of Generation IV systems and define the framework for safety design and evaluation methodology which could be applied to all reactor systems. It was recognized that development of advanced and enhanced safety assessment methodologies might be needed for this purpose. The paper provides an overview of the recent GIF Risk and Safety Working Group developments of technology neutral nuclear safety requirements and safety assessment methodologies. In particular, it addresses the applicability of “Objective Provision Tree” (OPT) methodology for verification of defence in depth application for new designs, {{as well as on the}} need to complement this methodology with traditional safety assessment techniques such as deterministic accident analysis and probabilistic safety assessments. The later are needed to judge on the adequacy of the safety provisions and relative importance of different provisions. The experienced gained with the pilot applications of the OPT methodology to different reactor designs will be also discussed along with the further effort needed to validate the applicability of this new proposed methodology for GIF reactor systems.

40|$|Following a {{large-scale}} release of radioactivity into the environment, different urban, industrial and rural environments may be contaminated for many years. Currently, {{there is limited}} systematic consideration of long-term management to ensure sustainability of areas contaminated by long-lived radionuclides. To sustain acceptable living and working conditions in such areas {{it is important to}} be able to construct robust, effective restoration strategies which address the many different types of environment, land use and ways of life. The overall objective of the STRATEGY project (directly addressing Key Action 2 : Nuclear Fission - <b>Off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> management in the Fifth Framework Programme) is to establish a decision framework to enable the selection of robust and practicable remediation strategies for Member States, which enable the long-term sustainable management of contaminated areas. The special objectives of the work carried out by GSF - Radiation Protection Institute and presented in this report was to contribute to the different urban/industrial parts of the STRATEGY project. Countermeasures being different from the usual urban ones and largely applicable in industrial area are collected and evaluated. The industrial area is defined here as such an area where productive and/or commercial activity is carried out. A good example is a supermarket or a factory. In designing restoration strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability of large and varied contaminated areas, there is a requirement to adopt a more holistic approach rather than simply selecting cost-effective countermeasures. The potentially negative consequences of restoration must be fully considered. The implementation of a remediation strategy may lead to a reduced collective dose, but increased dose to those implementing the strategies. Countermeasures may themselves generate waste and the practical consideration of disposal options has to be addressed. There is also a requirement that the radiological situation is fully explained and any remediation measures employed are transparent to affected populations. These issues are covered by the generation of a database, the so called countermeasure templates. (orig.)

40|$|In the {{preliminary}} study, the technical working group used a conservative calculation {{to demonstrate a}} minimum amount of time available to take unplanned <b>emergency</b> <b>off-site</b> evacuation actions. We calculated the time to heat a single fuel rod from 30 0 C to 900 °C at various times following permanent shutdown without considering any heat losses. This is a very conservative, non-realistic calculation because some cooling through conduction, convention or radiation would occur and increase the time to heatup. However, it provides a measure of time that is a bounding value for all heatup scenarios, including scenarios such as having a flat material fall {{on top of an}} assembly. This information was not used in determining interim criteria. The time available prior to a release is useful because the likelihood that personnel actions or offsite actions could be taken could affect the consequences of the event. Figures Al 1 - 1 and Al 1 - 2 show the increase in time that is required to heat a fuel pin from 30 'C to 900 'C as the time following shutdown increases given that all the heat is maintained in the fuel pin.

40|$|The IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) reactor {{design is}} being {{developed}} by an international consortium of 21 organizations from ten countries, including three members from Brazil and one from Mexico. This reflects the interest that Latin America has for a project which addresses the energy needs of the region. Presented {{here are some of}} the most recent developments in the IRIS project. The project's highest priority is the current pre-application licensing with the US NRC, which has required an investigation of the major accident sequences and a preliminary probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). The results of the accident analyses confirmed the outstanding inherent safety of the IRIS configuration and the PRA analyses indicated a core damage frequency due to internal events of the order of 2 E- 8. This not only highlights the enhanced safety characteristic of IRIS which should enhance its public acceptance, but it has also prompted IRIS to consider the possibility of being licensed without the need for <b>off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> response planning which would have a very positive economic implication. The modular IRIS, with each module rated at {approx} 335 MWe, is of course an ideal size for developing countries as it allows to easily introduce a moderate amount of power on limited electric grids. IRIS can be deployed in single modules in regions only requiring a few hundred MWs or in multiple modules deployed successively at time intervals in large urban areas requiring a larger amount of power increasing with time. IRIS is designed to operate ''hands-off'' as much as possible, with a small crew, having in mind deployment in areas with limited infrastructure. Thus IRIS has a 48 -months maintenance interval, long refueling cycles in excess of three years, and is designed to increase as much as possible operational reliability. For example, the project has recently adopted internal control rod drive mechanisms to eliminate vessel head penetrations and the possibility of corrosion cracking as in Davis-Besse and other plants. Latin America, as many other regions on the earth, needs water as much as electricity. IRIS has developed a water desalination co-generation design which can employ a variety of processes as dictated by local and economic conditions.

40|$|Executive summary Finland {{signed on}} 20 September 1994 the Convention on Nuclear Safety which was adopted on 17 June 1994 in the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. The Convention was {{ratified}} on 5 January 1996, {{and it came}} into force in Finland on 24 October 1996. This report is the Finnish National Report for the Seventh Review Meeting in March/April 2017. There are two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: the Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises of two PWR units (pressurised water reactors, of VVER type), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy, and the Olkiluoto plant two BWR units (boiling water reactors), operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj. In addition, a new nuclear power plant unit (PWR) is under construction at the Olkiluoto site. At both sites there are interim storages for spent fuel as well as disposal facilities for low and intermediate level nuclear wastes. Posiva, a joint company by Fortum and TVO, submitted a construction licence application for the spent nuclear fuel repository {{in the end of}} 2012. The construction licence was granted for Posiva by the Government in November 2015. Finland is currently reviewing a construction licence application for Fennovoima Hanhikivi unit 1 in Pyhäjoki (VVER type design). Since the review is underway, Hanhikivi unit 1 is discussed in this report mainly with regard to the licensing process and siting (see Articles 7 and 17 and Annex 5). Furthermore, there is a Triga Mark II research reactor, FiR 1 in Espoo licensed to VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 is valid until the end of 2023. However, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd has decided to shut down and decommission the reactor earlier due to economical reasons. This will be the first decommissioned nuclear facility in Finland representing a new challenge for the utility and the regulatory body. In this report, latest development in the various topics of the Convention on Nuclear Safety is described. Major safety reviews and plant modernisations are explained including safety assessment methods and key results. Safety performance of the Finnish nuclear power plants is also presented by using representative indicators. Finnish regulatory practices in licensing, provision of regulatory guidance, safety assessment, inspection and enforcement are also covered. Major developments in Finland since the Sixth Review Meeting are as follows: updating of legislative and regulatory framework, implementation of the renewed regulatory guides at the operating nuclear power plants completed, periodic safety review carried out at the Loviisa nuclear power plant in 2015 - 2016, and IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) carried out in Finland. Furthermore, construction of the new nuclear power plant unit continued and progressed to the operating licence phase, one new unit has entered into construction licence phase and construction licence for Olkiluoto Spent Nuclear Fuel encapsulation and disposal facility was granted. Latest development in the various topics of the Convention on Nuclear Safety is described in relevant articles. Finland continues the hosting and participation in the international peer reviews and the Government of Finland has requested the IAEA to carry out four OSART missions in Finland between 2017 – 2022 : • Olkiluoto 1 & 2 OSART mission will be conducted from 27 February until 16 March 2017 • Loviisa NPP OSART mission would take place in March 2018. • Pre-Operational OSART mission for Olkiluoto 3 before the first fuel loading (according to current schedule in April 2018) • Pre-Operational OSART mission for Fennovoima (Hanhikivi unit 1) would take place in 2022. In the report, the implementation of each of the Articles 6 to 19 of the Convention is separately evaluated. Based on the evaluation, the following features emphasising Finnish safety management practices in the field of nuclear safety can be concluded: • During the recent years Finnish legislation and regulatory guidance have been further developed and the revision of regulatory guide system was finalised in 2013. The overall revision of the regulatory guides took into account international guidance such as IAEA safety standards and WENRA (Western European Regulators’ Association) safety reference levels for existing reactors and safety objectives for new reactors. In addition, the lessons learnt from the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident are taken into account. No deviation from the convention obligations has been identified in the Finnish regulatory infrastructure including nuclear and radiation safety regulations. • The revised regulatory guides were published at the end of 2013. The revised guides are applied as such for new nuclear facilities. For the existing facilities and facilities under construction separate facility specific implementation decisions are made. In the end of 2014 the licensees of operating NPPs submitted to STUK assessments on the fulfilment of the revised regulatory guides. In 2015, STUK evaluated the assessments and made decisions on how to further improve safety. Regular update and implementation of regulatory guides, particularly with regard to nuclear power plants in operation, are unique measures on the international perspective. • The licensees have shown good safety performance and rigorous safety management practices in carrying out their safety related responsibilities in the operation and modernisation of existing NPPs. During recent years, only minor operational events (INES 1 and below) have taken place and no major safety problems have appeared. The licensees’ practices are considered to comply with the Convention obligations. • Safety assessment is a continuous process and living full scope level 1 and 2 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) practices are effectively used for the further development of safety. Periodic safety review of the Loviisa plant was carried out in 2015 – 2016, and the periodic safety review of the Olkiluoto plant was carried out in 2007 – 2009. The decisions how to apply the revised regulatory guides at the operating NPPs were made by STUK in 2015. Several plant modifications have been carried out at the operating NPPs during the recent years to further improve the safety. Some of these modifications are originating from the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. • The resources of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) have been increased to meet the needs to oversee the construction of the new plants in Finland. The reports of the recent IRRS mission and follow-up mission have been published on STUK’s website and mission results have been and will be used to further improve regulatory guidance and practices. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd supports effectively the regulatory body in the safety assessment work providing safety analysis capabilities and tools and performing safety analyses. There are also national research programmes which support and develop the competencies in nuclear safety and waste management of VTT {{as well as in the}} universities participating in the research programmes. • The Nuclear Energy Act was amended in 2015. The Act was revised to broaden STUK’s legal mandate to issue binding regulations. This was one of the recommendations from IRRS mission to Finland in 2012. Based on the amended Act, STUK published the new binding regulations concerning nuclear safety, security, emergency preparedness and waste management, as well as uranium and thorium mining in the beginning of 2016. Furthermore, based on changes in the Act the Government has to take into account the proposals included in the STUK’s statements when considering the conditions of the Decision-in-Principle and licences for nuclear facilities. • In January 2013 the Ministry of Employment and the Economy set up a working group to prepare a research and development strategy for the safe use of nuclear energy. The working group emphasized the importance of the research in the competence building. The Ministry of the Employment and Economy has started the implementation of the recommendations. In 2015 the Nuclear Energy Act was changed to ensure the financing for the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. The Sixth Review Meeting in 2014 identified some challenges and recorded some planned measures to improve nuclear safety in Finland. These issues are included and responded in this seventh national report of Finland. Some of these topics are discussed also below. These items were (in brackets the Articles, in which the issues are addressed) : • regulatory oversight of existing NPP’s: ageing management (see Article 14) • challenges in new NPP construction project (Olkiluoto unit 3); oversight of contractors and subcontractors, operating licence application review, digital I&C (see Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 18 and Annex 4) • preparation for the new build (see Annex 5) • maintaining and improving competence and responding to the growing needs for professional staff (see Articles 8 and 11) • continuous improvement of plant design: natural hazards, ultimate heat sink, I&C, electrical systems, spent fuel storage, emergency control room, replacement of diesel generators (see Articles 14, 17, 18 and Annexes 2, 3 and 4) • implementation of the action plan based on IRRS findings 2012, and follow-up IRRS mission in June 2015 (see Articles 7, 8, 10, 13, and Annex 6). Still some of these issues require further development to enhance safety, i. e., including provision for plant ageing, reliability and safety demonstration of digital I&C and management of competence taking into account the new build projects and retirement of experts. Other important issues cover new technologies, security arrangements and the growing need for new research and development programmes. These are generic issues that require international attention in all countries using nuclear energy. Implementation of the updated ageing management requirements is underway for NPPs in operation and some specific challenges to fulfil these requirements have been met. For instance the revised regulatory guide has a requirement on the availability and operability as well as monitoring the condition of spare parts. Inspections have revealed that the amount of spare parts can be inadequate for keeping the plant in a safe state also during either aged or obsoleted. Another challenge has to do with knowledge and resources allocated for ensuring appropriate ageing management programme at NPPs. Inspections have revealed that the licensees have challenges to implement knowledge management to ensure that in the event of personnel changes information and knowledge necessary for discharging the duties involved is transferred to the successors. Additional challenge is to conduct relevant research to both educate personnel and to identify new ageing mechanisms to develop new inspection or monitoring technologies to detect degradation early enough. The expected lifetime of the existing nuclear power plants requires renewal of systems, structures and components and modernisation of technologies. The regulation of the existing nuclear power plants emphasises the management of ageing and the quality of plant operations. The modernisation of I&C and other systems at the Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants are either undergoing or under planning, and therefore extra care is needed to ensure that operational safety will be maintained notwithstanding the plant modifications. Operating experience has shown that special attention has to be paid on the meticulous planning and controlled implementation and testing of the plant modifications and STUK is following this in its regulatory inspections. A generic lesson learned in Finland is that the closer nuclear power plants get to the end of their design lifetime, especially due to the current market price of electricity, more difficult it is for the licensees to make decisions to modernise or modify the NPPs. Instead of renewing a system or a component, modernisation may be rejected or a partial modification is planned resulting in ageing issues in the remaining parts. Finland has successfully applied periodic safety reviews (PSR) for the operating NPPs. Practice has been that the licensee is obliged to demonstrate that the safety of the operations can be ensured and improved also during the next 10 years, and to do that the licensee has to commit to make safety improvements including major modernisations to address ageing of SSCs. The retirement of large age groups in Finland has been affecting public administration and industry throughout, including STUK, utilities and the spent fuel management company Posiva as well as organisations providing technical support and education to them. The plans for a new NPP construction project and the above mentioned challenges and activities require additional resources and efforts from the nuclear power utilities and regulatory body as well as from technical support organisations. Thus, ensuring an adequate national supply of experts in nuclear science and technology and ensuring high quality research infrastructure are continuous challenges in Finland. For the moment, STUK has adequate resources to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. However, resources used for developing STUK’s own activities may be considered to be occasionally insufficient. The Government has been decreasing STUK’s budget during the past years mostly due to reorganisation of funding and conduct of research in the government organisations. While oversight activities are charged in full from the licensees and nuclear safety research programmes are funded via waste management fund, budget cuts have not impacted the nuclear safety research or resources needed for the regulated activities. However, due to budget cuts STUK has partly terminated and also decreased significantly its radiation safety research (e. g. biological effects of radiation, biodosimetry). Since radiation safety research activities have been contributing to the maintenance and development of know how in Finland, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will be continued in Finland. Since the interest in nuclear power in Finland is increasing, communication and information sharing with media and the general public on nuclear and radiation safety has become an increasingly important success factor for STUK and utilities. Regulatory processes and decisions have to be clear and understandable to general public. Due to the challenge, STUK has initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. In addition, STUK has also initiated a project to develop its crisis communication capabilities. This work is based on the experience on recent events as well as past emergency exercises. Actions taken as a result of the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident Following the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant on the 11 th of March in 2011 (TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident), safety assessments were initiated in Finland immediately. In order to ensure nuclear safety, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy requested STUK to carry out a study on how the Finnish NPPs have prepared against prolonged losses of electric power supply and ultimate heat sink and extreme natural phenomena. Based on the results of the assessments conducted in Finland, it was concluded that no such hazards or deficiencies have been found that would require immediate actions at the Finnish NPPs. However, areas where nuclear safety can further be enhanced were identified, and accordingly, Finnish National Action Plan how to address these areas was created. The experiences from the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident were also addressed in the renewed regulation and Finnish Regulatory Guides (YVL Guides) and in the nuclear safety research programme (SAFIR), see Articles 7 and 8. In addition to the periodic safety reviews carried out for the nuclear power plants, an extraordinary review of site related issues was performed after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident in connection with the so called European stress tests. Assessment of the safety margins and effects of exceeding the design basis values have been available and utilised for all identified relevant hazards (including extreme weather conditions) in connection with external events probabilistic risk assessments (PRA) which are mandatory for the Finnish NPPs. The stress tests did not reveal any new site-related external hazards or vulnerabilities of the plants to external events. No need for immediate action was recognised, but some additional studies of external hazards and feasibility studies for plant modifications to improve robustness against external events were found justified (see Article 17). The following examples of safety improvements and additional analyses of external events can be mentioned: enhanced protection against high seawater level at the Loviisa NPP, detailed structural analysis of spent fuel pools to demonstrate integrity of the pools in the case of an earthquake with consequential boiling in the pools and seismic walk-downs of the fire extinguishing water system at the Olkiluoto NPP following with some improvement measures. The systems needed for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools require external power at both Finnish NPPs. At both sites, the ultimate heat sink is the sea. A reliable supply of electrical power to the systems providing for basic safety functions at the Finnish NPPs is ensured by the Defence-in-Depth (DiD) concept. As a result of multiple and diversified electrical power sources at different DiD levels, the probability of loss of all electrical supply systems is considered very low at the Finnish NPPs. However, as a result of the studies made after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, further changes are under planning or implemented at the both NPPs (see Articles 6 and 18). For example at the Loviisa NPP the independent air-cooled cooling units have been installed for decay heat removal from the reactor core and from the spent fuel pools in case of the loss of sea as an ultimate heat sink. These cooling units were considered already before the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident due to the increased risks related to transporting of oil on the Finnish Gulf. Safety improvements at the Olkiluoto units 1 and 2 include ensuring cooling of the reactor core in case of total loss of AC systems, ensuring operation of the auxiliary feed water system pumps independently of availability of the sea water systems, and diverse cooling of the spent fuel pools. The emergency diesel generators will be replaced within the next few years. The new emergency diesel generators will be provided with alternative air and seawater cooling, while the existing diesels have only seawater cooling. A comprehensive severe accident management (SAM) strategy has been developed and implemented at the operating Finnish NPPs during 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s after the accidents in TMI and Chernobyl (see Annexes 2 and 3). These strategies are based on ensuring the containment integrity which is required in the existing national regulations. STUK has reviewed these strategies and has made inspections in all stages of implementation. As a result of the studies made after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, no major changes at the plants are considered necessary for severe accident management. However, the licensees are expected to consider ensuring the cooling of spent fuel pools in the SAM procedures (see Article 19). In addition, there are many actions related to the update of the emergency plans (see Article 16). Both NPPs were required to clarify and update their emergency preparedness plans with respect to issues like the possibility of several reactor units’ simultaneous accident, evaluation of the number and the suitability of emergency response personnel to their duties, management of access control and contamination control in the case when the normal arrangements are out of function and restoring the access routes and connections to the site in case of massive destruction of the infrastructure. Concerning the <b>off-site</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness and response (see Article 16), no needs for major changes were identified. However, some improvements were identified and implemented that are for instance improved accessibility to the site in case of extreme natural hazards, ensured sufficient amount of radiation protection equipment and radiation monitoring capabilities for rescue services and improved the communication arrangements between emergency centers of NPPs, STUK, and Rescue Service. In 2014 Loviisa NPP exercised for the first time a two reactor unit’s simultaneous accident scenario. Furthermore, during the national full command post exercise OLKI- 14 actions and decision making of the intermediate phase of the severe accident were exercised for the first time. Most of the Fukushima Dai-ichi related safety improvements presented in the Finnish national action plan have already been implemented. A few ongoing measures will still be completed in the next few years. Further information related to the actions taken in Finland following the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant are described in more detail under Articles 16, 17,...|$|E
