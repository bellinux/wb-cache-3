40|$|Reduction {{of support}} {{measures}} affecting soybean {{oil in the}} major soybean producing countries, {{as a consequence of}} WTO rules, coupled with rising demand for palm oil in non-traditional palm oil importing countries may lead to pronounced increases in agricultural land demand for oil palm expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia – two main palm oil producing and exporting countries. However, it is expected that the effects on agricultural land demand and consequently impact upon the environment will depend much on existing governance affecting environmental and forestry management in the two countries. Given the relatively more prevalent policy and institutional failures in Indonesia, it is anticipated that deforestation consequences and <b>open</b> <b>burnings</b> in the country will be stronger, inevitably giving rise to recurring haze externalities in the region. This study employed single and multi-country output supply exogenous policy models with explicit factor markets to examine agricultural land demand-trade linkages in the world vegetable oil markets. Shifts in export demand for palm oil and reductions of support measures affecting soybean production were simulated and effects on land use in Malaysia and Indonesia were observed under varying assumptions of environmental and forestry policy regimes in the two countries.

50|$|Using biomass as a fuel {{produces}} {{air pollution}} {{in the form of}} carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, NOx (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking). Use of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than <b>open</b> <b>burning</b> as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications. Black carbon - a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass - is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming. In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by <b>open</b> <b>burning</b> of biomass, {{and to a lesser extent}} by fossil-fuel burning.

40|$|<b>Open</b> biomass <b>burning</b> from {{wildfires}} and {{the prescribed}} burning of forests and farmland {{is a frequent}} occurrence in South-East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. This work reports on data collected from 10 - 30 September 2011, which covers the days before (10 - 14 September), during (15 - 20 September) and after (21 - 30 September) a period of biomass burning in SEQ. The aim of this project was to comprehensively quantify {{the impact of the}} biomass burning on air quality in Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. A multi-parameter field measurement campaign was conducted and ambient air quality data from 13 monitoring stations across SEQ were analysed. During the burning period, the average concentrations of all measured pollutants increased (from 20 % to 430 %) compared to the non-burning period (both before and after burning), except for total xylenes. The average concentration of O 3, NO 2, SO 2, benzene, formaldehyde, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and visibility-reducing particles reached their highest levels for the year, which were up to 10 times higher than annual average levels, while PM 10, PM 2. 5 and SO 2 concentrations exceeded the WHO 24 -hour guidelines and O 3 concentration exceeded the WHO maximum 8 -hour average threshold during the burning period. Overall spatial variations showed that all measured pollutants, with the exception of O 3, were closer to spatial homogeneity during the burning compared to the non-burning period. In addition to the above, elevated concentrations of three biomass burning organic tracers (levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan), together with the amount of non-refractory organic particles (PM 1) and the average value of f 60 (attributed to levoglucosan), reinforce that elevated pollutant concentration levels were due to emissions from <b>open</b> biomass <b>burning</b> events, 70 % of which were prescribed burning events. This study, which is the first and most comprehensive of its kind in Australia, provides quantitative evidence of the significant impact of <b>open</b> biomass <b>burning</b> events, especially prescribed burning, on urban air quality. The current results provide a solid platform for more detailed health and modelling investigations in the future...|$|R
