The nutrient-poor soil has been reseeded with meadow plants such as red clover, <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy,</b> self heal and yellow rattle.

Presently, however, it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched, for it led the nimble-footed Marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder; the grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up, and every <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy</b> did its best to catch the runaway, but failed entirely, for the wind liked a game of romps, and had it that day.

6000|$|For one sunny Sunday morning, after worship, Cyril {{had turned}} out into the fields behind the Common, for a quiet stroll among the birds and flowers: when, close by the stile in the upper meadow, he came {{unexpectedly}} upon Netta Leaworthy, alone upon the grass with her own fancies. She was pulling an <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy</b> carelessly to pieces as he passed, and he stopped a minute unperceived beside the hedge, to watch her deft fingers taking out one ray after another quickly from the blossom {{to the words of}} a foolish childish charm. Netta blushed crimson when she saw she was observed at that silly pastime, and Cyril thought to himself he had never seen anything in his life more lovely than the blushing girl at that moment. Learned and educated as he was, he had sprung himself from among the ranks of the many, and his heart was with them still rather than with the rich, the noble, and the mighty. [...] "I will never marry among the daughters of Heth," [...] he said to himself gently, as he paused beside her: [...] "I will take to myself rather a wife and a helpmate from among the Lord's own chosen people." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{a lovely}} summer evening. The sun was low {{enough to make the}} shadows long and refreshing, as they lay upon the {{blooming}} grass of the wilderness, softly swaying in the breeze, all pale with its numerous chaffy blossoms, and varied by the tall buttercups that raised up their shining yellow heads, or by white clouds of bold- faced <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisies.</b>|$|R

Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisies,</b> and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|R
