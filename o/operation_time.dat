5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing <b>operation</b> <b>time.</b> To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total <b>operation</b> <b>time,</b> including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, <b>operation</b> <b>time</b> etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E
25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle <b>operation</b> <b>time</b> and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|E

40|$|The first tool {{presented}} in this paper is a generic factory cost model that can estimate various costs at multiple levels of any manufacturing plant. The model is activity based which means that the cost of each manufacturing operation is calculated and then summed up so that the true £-per-hour factory cost rate as well as the exact unit cost (i. e. manufacturing cost) of an unlimited number of different components can be estimated. The second tool is a scalable cost model that predicts the unit cost of future integrally bladed disc (blisk) designs that are found in gas turbine compressors. The tool multiplies the machine cost rates, calculated by the factory cost model, by the <b>operation</b> <b>times</b> derived from blisk scaling rules. As the <b>operation</b> <b>times</b> often depend on the number of blades, the disc diameter and other design variables, many scaling rules are based on the correlation between <b>operation</b> <b>times</b> and certain design parameters. Conversely, the remaining process times are constant because they are independent of the blisk geometry. As future process times can only be estimated and the correlation between <b>operation</b> <b>times</b> and design parameters is never perfect, all <b>operation</b> <b>times</b> have uncertainty distributions. These are cascaded through the model to generate a probability distribution of the unit cost. Through the interactive exchange of detailed cost information at the manufacturing operation level as well as extrapolated <b>operation</b> <b>times,</b> the two cost models facilitate design and manufacturing engineering to concurrently optimise blisk designs and manufacturing processes in terms of cost...|$|R
