40|$|Recognition <b>of</b> {{handwritten}} <b>similar</b> shaped {{character is}} a difficult problem and in character recognition system most of the errors occur from similar shaped characters. In this paper we proposed a novel feature extraction technique to improve the recognition results <b>of</b> two <b>similar</b> shaped characters. The technique is based on F-ratio (Fisher Ratio), a statistical measure defined by the ratio to the between-class variance and within-class variance. F-ratio modifies the feature vector <b>of</b> two <b>similar</b> shape characters by weighting the feature elements. This weighting scheme enhances the feature elements that belongs to the distinguishable portions <b>of</b> the <b>similar</b> shaped characters and reduces the feature elements of the common portion of the characters, so that similar shaped characters can be identified easily. We considered pair <b>of</b> handwritten <b>similar</b> shape characters <b>of</b> different scripts like Arabic/Persian, Devnagari English, Bangla, Oriya, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu etc. and we noted that f-ratio based feature weighting shows better recognition results. 1...|$|R

40|$|Epr, a minor {{extracellular}} protease, {{is involved}} in the swarming motility of Bacillus subtilis. It does so by providing essential signals required for swarming. It has also been demonstrated that DegU is required for swarming and that it occurs at very low levels <b>of</b> DegU <b>similar</b> to P and is inhibited at high levels <b>of</b> DegU <b>similar</b> to P. In this study, we show that maximal epr expression is observed at very low concentrations <b>of</b> DegU <b>similar</b> to P, whereas it is repressed at high DegU similar to P. A parallel effect <b>of</b> DegU <b>similar</b> to P levels on swarming motility is also observed, where very low levels <b>of</b> DegU <b>similar</b> to P support swarming and excessive DegU similar to P abolishes swarming. We further demonstrate that the defect of swarming motility in a degU(-) strain can be rescued, albeit incompletely, by increased expression of an exogenous epr gene. We also show that an additional extracellular factor(s), apart from epr, regulated by DegU, is required for robust swarming...|$|R
