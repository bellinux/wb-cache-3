5|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} game, The Shivering Isles is an <b>open-ended</b> expansion. The main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with non-player characters, and develops a character according to their taste. Once the game is updated the player can access the extra content at any time with any character.|$|E
5|$|Kutuzov ordered Yermolov to take action; {{the general}} brought forward three horse {{artillery}} batteries {{that began to}} blast the <b>open-ended</b> redoubt, while the 3rd Battalion of the Ufa Regiment and two Jäger regiments brought up by Barclay rushed in with the bayonet to eliminate Bonami's Brigade. The Russian reinforcements' assault returned the redoubt to Russian control.|$|E

5|$|The first {{departures from}} St Pancras on 14 November 2007 coincided with an <b>open-ended</b> strike by French rail unions {{as part of}} general strike actions over {{proposed}} public-sector pension reforms. The trains were operated by uninvolved British employees and service was not interrupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is <b>open-ended</b> with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has {{to set in}} motion a process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, <b>open-ended</b> roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an <b>open-ended</b> conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, {{the extent to which the}} thoughts are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Adventure mode is a turn-based, <b>open-ended</b> roguelike {{where the}} player starts off as an adventurer. In Legends mode, players can view maps, {{histories}} of each civilization and any figure {{who has lived}} or died in the generated world.

A testing arena is present, where players can simulate battles between selected units in various conditions.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its <b>open-ended</b> nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
5|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass {{a variety of other}} music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and <b>open-ended</b> dissonance.|$|E
5|$|Just Cause 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its gameplay, <b>open-ended</b> nature, stunts, world design and graphics and criticized its story, gunplay and mission design. Sales of six million copies worldwide exceeded original projections. The game was supported with downloadable content at release, and a multiplayer fan project was eventually approved as an add-on. A sequel, Just Cause 3, {{was released in}} late 2015.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, and it takes place in an <b>open-ended</b> world with interconnected regions. Gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Progress through the game requires both dimensions to be explored, using power-ups that Samus acquires over time. Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus to somersault in midair and off certain surfaces, and new beam weapons that have limited ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The V-scale, which {{originated}} in the United States, is an <b>open-ended</b> rating system with higher numbers indicating {{a higher degree of}} difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} released for Microsoft Windows {{at the start}} of 2011 via Zachtronics' own website. Though it was initially rejected for sale on the Steam platform, Valve later offered to sell the game after it received high praise from game journalists; further attention came from the game's release alongside one of the Humble Indie Bundles. The game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices. Reviewers found the game's <b>open-ended</b> problem-solving nature as a highlight of the title. SpaceChem was incorporated into some academic institutions for teaching concepts related to both chemistry and programming.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} edit {{was almost}} three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut {{material from the}} first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to leave it <b>open-ended.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Dutch-language {{production}} began previews at the Circustheater in Scheveningen, The Netherlands on October 26, 2011 and {{was produced}} by Joop van den Ende Theaterproducties/Stage Entertainment. The official opening took place on November 6. Willemijn Verkaik reprises her role of Elphaba from the German productions, becoming the first actress {{to play the role}} in two different languages. She is joined by Chantal Janzen as Glinda, Jim Bakkum as Fiyero, Pamela Teves as Madame Morrible, Christanne de Bruijn as Nessarose, Niels Jacobs as Boq, Jochem Feste Roozemond as Doctor Dillamond and Bill van Dijk {{in the role of the}} Wizard. As musicals do not usually run for a long <b>open-ended</b> run in the Netherlands, closing night took place as announced on January 11, 2013, following a 14-month run.|$|E
5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting <b>open-ended</b> levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an <b>open-ended</b> environment to find a magical chalice {{and return it to}} the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains <b>open-ended</b> from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as <b>open-ended</b> with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance is an <b>open-ended</b> 4X {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{game from}} Gremlin Interactive, released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. Diplomacy is crucial to {{the success or failure of}} this franchise operation as the players colonies begin to encroach on one another.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto Online {{launched}} on 1 October 2013, {{two weeks after}} Grand Theft Auto Vs release. Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens. Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October {{in an effort to}} resolve the issues, but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared. Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch as recompense. Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand Theft Auto Online experience, but generally recognised its <b>open-ended</b> exploration and dynamic content as strengths.|$|E
5|$|Instead, Super Mario 64 was {{followed}} by other 3D Mario games on subsequent Nintendo systems, such as Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube and Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii. These later titles built on Super Mario 64s core design of enhancement items and open ended gameplay. Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a remake of Mario 64s Whomp's Fortress level. Later 3D titles, namely Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, while keeping many of Super Mario 64s core gameplay elements, departed from the game's <b>open-ended</b> design and focused more on platforming reminiscent of 2D titles. The Nintendo Switch game Super Mario Odyssey returns to Super Mario 64s open design.|$|E
5|$|It had {{now become}} clear to President Johnson that McNamara {{had become a}} {{liability}} to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned his position {{and was replaced by}} Clark Clifford, who was chosen because of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara's suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara's position, however was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, (until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign). Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi's reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt the views of the man he had replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from an <b>open-ended</b> commitment to the war.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of <b>open-ended</b> gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of <b>open-ended</b> questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Zero Mission {{takes place}} on Planet Zebes, a large, <b>open-ended</b> world with areas {{connected}} by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet's caverns and environments, hunting Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible, so that the game can be played linearly or non-linearly. For example, the player may come across underground caverns that bypass certain sections, a method termed sequence breaking. To save their progress, players can enter either Save Rooms or Samus's ship on Crateria. As a remake of Metroid, Metroid: Zero Missions layout bears a resemblance to the original, and various powerups and items make reappearances from previous games in the series, with similar uses, effects, and appearances. However, the game adds new items, areas, and mini-bosses, {{as well as a}} completely new area named Chozodia.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or <b>open-ended</b> interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six <b>open-ended</b> questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in January 2007 by publisher Eidos Interactive, {{and a year later}} a Christmas 2008 release was planned. Its release was later postponed to the third quarter of 2009. A demo for the game, released on 4 March 2010, attracted more than two million players. According to studio founder Christofer Sundberg, the demo was envisioned as a smaller version of the game so players could fully experience its <b>open-ended</b> gameplay. After Japanese publisher Square Enix acquired Eidos Interactive, it announced that the game would be released in North America on 23 March 2010 and in Europe on 26 March. Pre-orders received a map of Panau and access to the Black Market Chaos Pack. An Ultimate Edition, with the game and the Black Market Aerial and Boom Packs, was released on 20 December 2011 for the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for <b>open-ended</b> game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an <b>open-ended</b> sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} touring cast intended {{to play a}} limited engagement from April 29 to June 12, 2005 at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, producers decided to extend it to an <b>open-ended</b> run, making it the first non-Broadway sit-down production of Wicked. Opening at the same Chicago theatre {{the day after the}} touring production had finished, {{the original}} Chicago cast included Ana Gasteyer as Elphaba, Kate Reinders as Glinda, Rondi Reed as Madame Morrible, Kristoffer Cusick as Fiyero, Telly Leung as Boq, Heidi Kettenring as Nessarose and Gene Weygandt as the Wizard. The production closed on January 25, 2009, after over 1,500 performances. The touring production returned to Chicago for a special engagement at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from December 1, 2010 to January 23, 2011. In celebration of the musical's 10th anniversary, the tour played an eight-week return engagement, returning to the Oriental Theatre, from October 30 through December 21, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors III is a {{platforming}} {{video game}} which features <b>open-ended</b> gameplay elements similar to games such as Metroid and Faxanadu. Players control {{the main character}} Kuros as he sets out to defeat Malkil and free the town of Piedup. The game features three separate realms in which the player must explore - the town, the underworld, and the palace; players can freely navigate from one realm to another. Throughout the game, players find money {{which can be used}} to buy items from inns located throughout Piedup; players can buy keys for unlocking doors, food and drink for restoring health, and information from shopkeepers. Players begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives have been lost; unlike the previous Wizards & Warriors games, there is no password or continue feature.|$|E
