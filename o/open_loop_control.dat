25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control.</b> Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

30|$|As the UE {{is limited}} by the maximum {{transmission}} power, the uplink power control is an important issue. It consists of <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> and closed <b>loop</b> power <b>control.</b> The <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> aims at compensating for slow variations of channel conditions, i.e., pathloss and shadowing. The closed <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> targets at further adjusting the UE’s transmission power to optimize the system performance.|$|R

The speed is regulated by using PI and fuzzy controllers. The response of these two systems are compared. This drive has advantages like low EMI, low stress and improved dynamic response...|$|R
2500|$|In <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control,</b> {{the control}} {{action from the}} {{controller}} is independent of the [...] "process output" [...] (or [...] "controlled process variable"). A {{good example of this}} is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. (The control action is the switching on/off of the boiler. The process output is the building temperature).|$|E
2500|$|In <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control,</b> {{the control}} {{action from the}} {{controller}} is independent of the [...] "process output" [...] (or [...] "controlled process variable" [...] - PV). A {{good example of this}} is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.|$|E
50|$|Although {{feedback}} {{is an important}} aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control.</b> A classic example of <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> is a washing machine that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of sensors.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend our earlier {{results on the}} use of {{periodic}} forcing and averaging to solve the constructive controllability problem for drift-free left-invariant systems on Lie groups with fewer controls than state variables. In particular, we prove a third-order averaging theorem applicable to systems evolving on general matrix Lie groups and show how to use the resulting approximations to construct <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> for complete controllability of systems that require up to depth- two Lie brackets to satisfy the Lie algebra controllability rank condition. The motion control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle is modeled as a drift-free left-invariant system on the matrix Lie group SE (3). In the general case, when only one translational and two angular control inputs are available, this system satisfies the controllability rank condition using depth-two Lie brackets. We use the third-order averaging result and its geometric interpretation to construct <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> to arbitrarily translate and orient an autonomous underwater vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} (linear) Schrödinger equations, of very general form, which are defined on a bounded domain ­ Omega subset R^n. With focus on these dynamics, we shall then discuss {{and analyze the}} {{specific}} and foundational topic of a-priori energy identities, {{with the goal of}} deriving control-theoretic implications. These will include the issue of optimal regularity, as well as the problems of exact controllability (by <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls)</b> and of uniform stabilization (by closed <b>loop</b> feedback <b>controls)</b> ...|$|R

The detection mechanism {{is based on a}} novel technique of wavelet transform. In this method, the stator currents will be used as an input to the system. No direct access to the induction motor is required. The simulation results are presente...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two common}} classes of control systems, <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> systems, and {{closed loop control}} systems.|$|E
50|$|Feedforward {{control is}} {{distinctly}} different from <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> and teleoperator systems. Feedforward control requires {{a mathematical model}} of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant's relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the physical system or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model {{of the system is}} a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the task of}} controlling ensembles of initial and terminal state vectors of parameter-dependent linear systems by applying parameter-independent <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls.</b> Necessary, as well as sufficient, conditions for ensemble controllability are established, using tools from complex approximation theory. For real analytic families of linear systems it is shown that ensemble controllability holds only for systems with at most two independent parameters. We apply the results to networks of linear systems and {{address the question of}} open-loop robust synchronization...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{profilometer}} that is under {{development at the}} Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Cagliari (DiMeCa) requires a translation stage able to displace part of the optical system with sub-micrometric resolution. This work describes {{the development of an}} interferometric displacement sensor which enables, by its feedback, to accurately <b>control</b> an otherwise <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controlled</b> electrostrictive translation stage. After a short description of the optical system, the mechanical assembly, the electronic module and the software interface will be described. At the end some experimental result, showing the performances of the sensor will be illustrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to affirm the application of closed-loop optimal control for load shifting in plants with electricity tariffs that include time-of-use (TOU) and maximum demand (MD) charges. The water pumping scheme of the Rietvlei water purification plant in the Tshwane municipality (South Africa) is selected for the case study. The objective is to define and simulate a closed-loop load shifting (scheduling) strategy for the Rietvlei plant that yields the maximum potential cost saving under both TOU and MD charges. The control problem is firstly formulated as a discrete time linear <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> optimal <b>control</b> model. Thereafter, the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> optimal <b>control</b> model is converted into a closed-loop optimal control model using a model predictive control technique. Both the open and closed-loop optimal control models are then simulated and compared with the current (simulated) level based control model. The optimal control models are solved with integer programming optimization. The <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> optimal <b>control</b> model is also solved with linear programming optimization and the result is used as an optimal benchmark for comparisons. Various scenarios with different simulation timeouts, switching intervals, control horizons...|$|R
50|$|Process control {{may either}} use {{feedback}} {{or it may}} be <b>open</b> <b>loop.</b> <b>Control</b> may also be continuous (automobile cruise control) or cause a sequence of discrete events, such as a timer on a lawn sprinkler (on/off) or controls on an elevator (logical sequence).|$|E

50|$|Brushless DC motors {{are widely}} used as servomotors for machine tool servo drives. Servomotors are used for {{mechanical}} displacement, positioning or precision motion control. In the past DC stepper motors were used as servomotors; however, since they are operated with <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control,</b> they typically exhibit torque pulsations. Brushless DC motors are more suitable as servomotors since their precise motion is based upon a closed loop control system that provides tightly controlled and stable operation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} Active Fault Tolerant Control System {{based on a}} {{reconfigurable}} reference input when performance degradation occurs on system due to faults. The main idea/contribution is to consider the reconfigured system as an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controlled</b> by a classical MPC strategy in order to design “one-line” new reference inputs. The added value of this method {{is to reduce the}} energy spent to achieve desired closed-loop performance and consequently to maintain a reliable system in dynamical way. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a three-tank system corrupted by abrupt actuator faults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of closed <b>loop</b> and <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controlled</b> Interleaved Boost Converter (ILBC). It is seen that, for higher power applications, more modules can be paralleled to increase the power rating and the dynamic performance. One of the challenge in designing a boost converter for high power application is {{how to handle the}} high current at the input side. In this paper an interleaved boost dc-dc converter is proposed for current sharing on high power application. Moreover, this converter also reduces the ripple current. The simulated results are presented with R load...|$|R

Using this theorem, we show how to construct <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> for complete controllability of systems that require up to depth-one Lie brackets to satisfy the Lie algebra controllability rank condition. We apply these results to the attitude control problem with only two controls available and to the unicycle motion planning problem...|$|R
50|$|A {{thermostat}} on {{a heater}} {{is an example}} of <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> that is on or off. A temperature sensor turns the heat source on if the temperature falls below the set point and turns the heat source off when the set point is reached. There is no measurement of the difference between the set point and the measured temperature (e.g. no error measurement) and no adjustment to the rate at which heat is added other than all or none.|$|E
50|$|Some movements, however, occur {{too quickly}} to {{integrate}} sensory information, and instead {{must rely on}} feed forward control. <b>Open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> is a feed forward form of motor control, and is used to control rapid, ballistic movements that end before any sensory information can be processed. To best study this type of control, most research focuses on deafferentation studies, often involving cats or monkeys whose sensory nerves have been disconnected from their spinal cords. Monkeys who lost all sensory information from their arms resumed normal behavior after recovering from the deafferentation procedure. Most skills were relearned, but fine motor control became very difficult.|$|E
50|$|Inverse models {{predict the}} {{necessary}} movements of motor components {{to achieve a}} desired perceptual outcome. They can also take {{the outcome of a}} motion and attempt to determine the sequence of motor commands that resulted in that state. These types of models are particularly useful for <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control,</b> and allow for specific types of movements, such as fixating on a stationary object while the head is moving. Complimentary to forward models, inverse models attempt to estimate how to achieve a particular perceptual outcome in order to generate the appropriate motor plan. Because inverse models and forward model are so closely associated, studies of internal models are often used as evidence for the roles of both model types in action.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} optimisation based <b>control</b> techniques: an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> optimal <b>control</b> (OLOC) and a recording horizon control (RHC), for the control of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system with exothermic reactions, which exhibit multiple steady state conditions. This type of control techniques requires the solution of an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> optimal <b>control</b> problem which consists of an objective function, system constraint and state or manipulated variable constraint. Simulation results have demonstrated that the OLOC controller can only perform well if all model parameters are known exactly and not when model mismatches exist. The RHC controller, on the other hand, gives better results and is much more robust for systems with plant/model mismatches within a certain range...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{methodology}} {{is used to}} determine optimal <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> for the atmospheric portion of the aeroassisted plane change problem. The method is hybrid {{in the sense that}} it combines the features of numerical collocation with the analytically tractable portions of the problem which result when the two-point boundary value problem is cast in the form of a regular perturbation problem. Various levels of approximation are introduced by eliminating particular collocation parameters and their effect upon problem complexity and required number of nodes is discussed. The results include plane changes of 10, 20, and 30 degrees for a given vehicle...|$|R

First, <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> scalar <b>control,</b> closed <b>loop</b> scalar <b>control</b> and speed estimated scalar control are explained. Then, static characteristics obtained by experimental measurements are analyzed and compared for different control principles. Finally, based on experimental results, it is proposed when and which drive is to be used...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> system is manual non-power-assisted {{steering}} of a motor car; the steering system does {{not have access to}} an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, power steering has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism. This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See Model predictive control.|$|E

40|$|Existence of viable (controlled invariant) {{solutions}} of {{a control}} problem regulated by absolutely continuous <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> is proved {{by using the}} concept of viability kernels of closed subsets (largest closed controlled invariant subsets). This is needed to provide dynamical feedbacks, i. e., differential equations governing the evolution of viable controls. Among such differential equations, the differential equation providing heavy solutions (in the sense of heavy trends), i. e., governing the evolution of controls with minimal velocity is singled out. Among possible applications, these results are used to define global contingent subsets of the contingent cones which allow to prove the convergence of {{a modified version of}} the structure algorithm to a closed viability domain of any closed subset...|$|R
40|$|The time optimal motion {{problem for}} the {{overhead}} crane is split into two sub-problems: {{the selection of a}} geometric path for the load which fulfills the rendezvous and the generation of the time optimal trajectory along the chosen path. Our method uses the differential flatness of the system: it is sufficient to know the Cartesian coordinates of the load and their derivatives, to compute each variable of the system, including state and controls. This property greatly simplifies the motion planning problem and allows us to set bounds on any set of variables of the system. A numerical example shows that this new approach is very efficient to generate <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> as smooth as needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} differences in operator control strategies {{in a complex}} task were evaluated in two training scenarios: in-the-loop training and out-of-the-loop training. Verbal protocols and performance measures revealed four types of complex control mechanisms dependent upon these two training approaches. The four types were display based <b>control,</b> <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> input <b>control,</b> closed <b>loop</b> input <b>control,</b> and an input-display control mix. Performance differences favored in-the-loop training, {{and led to the}} development of an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> input <b>control</b> strategy. The overall results indicate that performance improvements may be achieved with operator training on the system dynamics and optimization aspects rather than operator training directed only at the optimization aspects. A "sitting by Nellie" approach such as watching an expert or watching an algorithm perform a task may be disastrous if the system dynamics are poorly understood. This study also suggests how operator strategies can be effectively used to design user-friendly aids which improve operator performance in complex control tasks. © 1995 Elsevier B. V.
