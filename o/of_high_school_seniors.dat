Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as [...] "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "strong and [...] "charismatic" [...] young actors were [...] "let down by the screenplay". The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores {{the relationship between a}} high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him [...] "a better actor". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as [...] "major star material" [...] with a [...] "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon" [...] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his [...] "raw talent". The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411. In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was [...] "emotionally disconnected for the whole film." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the [...] "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he [...] "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché" [...] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his [...] "one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer". The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.|$|E
