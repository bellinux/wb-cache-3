Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines {{have been used for}} household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Frenchtown to Raritan, Somerset County, running along its current alignment to Flemington and following present-day US 202 between Flemington and Raritan. By the 1940s, US 202 and Route 29 replaced Route 12 east of Flemington, and the route was officially designated to end in Flemington in 1953. There are currently plans to modify <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> three traffic circles along the route in Flemington to ease traffic congestion.|$|E

5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 was legislated {{as a new}} {{route in}} the 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} that was to run from Frenchtown east to Route 28 in Raritan borough, running along its current alignment to Flemington and following present-day US 202 to Raritan. By the 1940s, US 202 and Route 29 were designated along the alignment of Route 12 between Flemington and Raritan, cutting the route's eastern terminus back to Flemington. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 12 was officially legislated to run from Frenchtown to US 202 and Route 69 (now Route 31) in Flemington. There are currently plans to modify <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> the three traffic circles along Route 12 in Flemington in order to ease traffic congestion along the route. The Main Street Circle was converted to a modern roundabout in 2010 while plans are still being thought out for the other two traffic circles.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit <b>or</b> <b>eliminate</b> his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At {{the peak of his}} power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E
