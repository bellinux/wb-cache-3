40|$|In {{the last}} nine years, we have designed, implement, and {{evaluated}} the systemic approach to teaching and learning chemistry (SATLC) [1 - 4]. In continuing this work, we have designed {{a new kind of}} <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> based on systemics, which is presented here. The questions in <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> require a very short answer. The questions are related to facts (thus, objective) which have unequivocal answers. Objective questions can be multiple choice, true/false, and fill in the blank. The scoring procedure for an <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> is completely specified enabling agreement among different scorers. Traditional <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> are usually good instruments examining the recall of information and the application of terms, but they cannot assess learning beyond comprehension. However, systemic <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> can challenge students and potentially can test higher learning levels (e. g., analysis, synthesis, and evaluation in Bloom’s taxonomy [5, 6]). We illustrate here examples of systemic multiple choice questions that can form the basis of conventional <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> and which require a choice from a list of possible systemic-related answers. Each systemic choice represents three to five physical, or chemical relations, between concepts, atoms, or molecules. Various types of systemic multiple choice questions from the fields of general, organic, heterocyclic, and physical, chemistry are presented here. 2...|$|R

40|$|This paper contends for {{a greater}} role for <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> on public safety grounds, and {{building}} on the measure of objectivity contained in reckless murder at common law and constructive murder in all Australian States, seeks to redress the balance in favour of <b>objective</b> <b>tests.</b> The argument is made for an <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> for recklessness as the underlying fault element, based on the natural and probable consequences test adopted in Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [1961] AC 290, {{which is similar to}} objective ‘Caldwell’ recklessness where the defendant does not foresee the relevant risk but a reasonable person would have, following Caldwell [1982] AC 341. The paper also advances the case for the adoption of purely <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> for provocation and self-defence, because the current tests in Australia for both defences are confusing as they combine subjective and objective elements. ...|$|R
40|$|Tactile, verbal subjective, and <b>objective</b> <b>tests</b> {{were done}} on 300 {{patients}} after inferior dental, lingual, and buccal nerve anaesthetic block injections were given.

Forty-two (63. 6 %) out of the 66 patients (with change in the middle-third and satisfactory <b>objective</b> <b>test)</b> complained of pain when extraction was attempted. When re-injected, a change in labial sensation occurred in the mid line or beyond the midline during subsequent tactile subjective test. Adequate anaesthesia was achieved and extractions were carried out. These findings suggest that tactile subjective test is more efficient and sensitive than verbal subjective and <b>objective</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

50|$|The court {{justified}} an <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> {{by citing}} cases from other circuits. The court also endorsed an <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> on policy grounds. First, the court reasoned that an <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> is more easily administered. That is, {{it would be}} impractical to determine what combination of price and style would push clothes out of the personal category and into a work-only status. Moreover, a subjective test would involve an examination of a taxpayer’s personal taste and fashion sense, providing no guidelines for a court to follow in its determination of what is deductible. Second, under a utilitarian theory, fairness among {{the greatest number of}} taxpayers is best served with an <b>objective</b> <b>test.</b> Under a subjective test “two similarly situated YSL boutique managers with identical wardrobes would be subject to disparate tax consequences depending upon the particular manager’s lifestyle and ‘socio-economic level.’” The court wished to avoid such a result.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>objective</b> <b>test</b> is a {{psychological}} test that measures an individual's characteristics independent of rater bias or the examiner's own beliefs, usually {{by the administration}} of a bank of questions marked and compared against exacting scoring mechanisms that are completely standardized, much {{in the same way}} that examinations are administered. <b>Objective</b> <b>tests</b> are often contrasted with projective tests, which are sensitive to rater's or examiner's beliefs. Projective tests are based on Freudian Psychology (Psychoanalysis) and seek to expose the unconscious perceptions of people. <b>Objective</b> <b>tests</b> tend to have more validity than projective tests; however, they are still subject to the willingness of the examinee to be open about his/her personality and as such can sometimes be badly representative of the true personality of the subject. Projective tests purportedly expose certain aspects of the personality of individuals that are impossible to measure by means of an <b>objective</b> <b>test,</b> and are much more reliable at uncovering [...] "protected" [...] or unconscious personality traits or features.|$|R

50|$|<b>Objective</b> <b>testing</b> {{should begin}} with {{spirometry}} at rest. In true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the {{results should be}} within normal limits. Should resting values be abnormal, then asthma, or some other chronic lung condition, is present. There is, of course, no reason why asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction should not co-exist but the distinction is important because without successful treatment of underlying asthma, treatment of an exercise component will likely be unsuccessful. If baseline testing is normal, some form of exercise or pharmacologic stress will be required, either on the sideline or practice venue, or in the laboratory.|$|E

But the technology of testing that followed, with its major emphasis on reliability and the automatisation of marking, has been an uncomfortable partner for some areas of educational achievement: assessing writing or speaking, and other kinds of performance need something more qualitative and judgemental.|$|E

Cattell also developed several mathematical methods for adjusting psychometric graphs, such as his [...] "scree" [...] test and similarity coefficients. His research {{led to the development}} of his theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence, as well as his 16 Personality Factors theory of personality. Cattell was a strong advocate of factor analysis and psychometrics. He believed that all theory should be derived from research, which supports the continued use of empirical observation and <b>objective</b> <b>testing</b> to study human intelligence.|$|E
