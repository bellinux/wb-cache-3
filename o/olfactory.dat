5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the <b>olfactory</b> lobes, a pair of {{structures}} that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two <b>olfactory</b> nerves. The <b>olfactory</b> lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the <b>olfactory</b> lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|Other {{regions of}} Tbr1 {{expression}} are: the <b>olfactory</b> bulbs and <b>olfactory</b> nuclei, the lateral hypothalamus region, the entopeduncular nucleus, the eminentia thalami.|$|E
5|$|Studies of the <b>olfactory</b> bulbs of dromaeosaurids {{reveal that}} they had similar <b>olfactory</b> ratios for their size to other non-avian theropods and modern birds with an acute sense of smell, such as tyrannosaurids and the turkey vulture, {{probably}} reflecting {{the importance of the}} <b>olfactory</b> sense in the daily activities of dromaeosaurids such as finding food.|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> bulb is {{a special}} {{structure}} that processes <b>olfactory</b> sensory signals and sends its output to the <b>olfactory</b> part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> {{system is}} made up in part of the RMS which {{stretches}} from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the <b>olfactory</b> bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the <b>olfactory</b> tract and the <b>olfactory</b> bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior <b>olfactory</b> cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the <b>olfactory</b> tract, which ends in the <b>olfactory</b> bulb.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the <b>olfactory</b> mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the <b>olfactory</b> nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the <b>olfactory</b> bulb from where information is passed to the <b>olfactory</b> cortex.|$|E
5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as <b>olfactory</b> neuroblastoma, is {{believed}} to arise from the <b>olfactory</b> epithelium and its classification remains controversial. However, since {{it is not a}} sympathetic nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is {{not to be confused with}} neuroblastoma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olfactory</b> lobes {{are absent}} in river dolphins, {{suggesting}} {{that they have no}} sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while <b>olfactory</b> receptors of the main <b>olfactory</b> system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The <b>olfactory</b> bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the <b>olfactory</b> bulbs, {{as well as the}} {{terminal}} and <b>olfactory</b> nerves, suggest that Tarbosaurus had a keen sense of smell, as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus. The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the <b>olfactory</b> bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen's organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> lobes {{are absent}} in porpoises, {{suggesting}} {{that they have no}} sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> nerve (I) {{conveys the}} sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the <b>olfactory</b> lobes. The enlarged <b>olfactory</b> region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large <b>olfactory</b> bulbs and <b>olfactory</b> nerves {{relative}} to their brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the <b>olfactory</b> bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} strepsirrhine primates, <b>olfactory</b> {{communication}} is used extensively by ruffed lemurs – scent marking in territorial defense and disputes, {{as well as}} female greeting displays. The scents communicate the sex, location, and identity of their owner.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the <b>olfactory</b> bulb, but they do have an <b>olfactory</b> tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no <b>olfactory</b> nerves or <b>olfactory</b> lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large <b>olfactory</b> bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed {{cartilaginous}} nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the <b>olfactory</b> region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the <b>olfactory</b> region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the <b>olfactory</b> region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major advocate {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large <b>olfactory</b> bulbs and <b>olfactory</b> nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E
5|$|The {{cranial nerves}} are {{considered}} {{components of the}} peripheral nervous system (PNS), although on a structural level the <b>olfactory,</b> optic and terminal nerves are more accurately {{considered part of the}} central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high <b>olfactory</b> acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of <b>olfactory</b> receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory <b>olfactory</b> bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory <b>olfactory</b> bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main <b>olfactory</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminal}} nerves, <b>olfactory</b> nerves (I) and optic nerves (II) {{emerge from}} the cerebrum or forebrain, and the remaining ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which is {{the lower part of}} the brain.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, mature {{females of}} P. fimbriata, P. africana, P. fimbriata, P. labiata, and P. schultzi emit <b>olfactory</b> signals that {{reduce the risk}} that any other females, males or juveniles {{of the same species}} may contend for the same prey. The effect {{inhibits}} aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if the prey spider is visible, and also if the prey is inhabiting any part of a web. If a female of one of these Portias smells a male of the same species, the female stimulates the males to court. These Portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive <b>olfactory</b> signals from members of other Portia species.|$|E
5|$|William Tinsley Keeton (1933–1980) studied homing pigeons, {{showing that}} they were able to {{navigate}} using the earth's magnetic field, the sun, as well as both <b>olfactory</b> and visual cues.|$|E
5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by <b>olfactory</b> and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and <b>olfactory</b> discrimination, and <b>olfactory</b> learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|Like all ants, {{they can}} also make use of visual {{landmarks}} when available as well as <b>olfactory</b> and tactile cues to navigate. Some species of ant are {{able to use the}} Earth's magnetic field for navigation. The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{is based}} on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for {{direction}} involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields (magnetoception), use visual landmarks as well as <b>olfactory</b> cues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olfactory</b> cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olfactory</b> {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how <b>olfactory</b> cues are used.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{developing}} neurons reach {{the core of}} the <b>olfactory</b> bulb, they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this migration is dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons. These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging.|$|E
5|$|Sharks have keen <b>olfactory</b> senses, {{located in}} the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the {{anterior}} and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater.|$|E
5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola that {{surrounds}} the nipple in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} <b>olfactory</b> stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> lobe of its brain {{responsible}} for processing smells is particularly large {{compared to other}} animals. This characteristic of New World vultures {{has been used by}} humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the foraging vultures.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main <b>olfactory</b> bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our <b>olfactory</b> sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E
