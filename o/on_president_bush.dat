40|$|Betting on {{elections}} {{has been}} of interest to economists and political scientists for some time. We recently persuaded TradeSports to run experimental contingent betting markets, in which one bets <b>on</b> whether <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> will be re-elected, conditional on other specified events occurring. Early results suggest that market participants strongly believe that Osama bin Ladens capture would have a substantial effect <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bushs</b> electoral fortunes, and interestingly that the chance of his capture peaks just before the election. More generally, these markets suggest that issues outside the campaign - like {{the state of the}} economy, and progress on the war on terror - are the key factors in the forthcoming election. ...|$|R

50|$|The book's chief contention, which {{provides}} {{the rationale for}} its title, is that President Bush planned from early in his presidency to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force, rather than making any serious effort to use diplomacy or other means. The book describes White House deliberations implying that if Saddam were removed from power without a military invasion, Iraq would need a foreign-implemented regime change. It focuses mainly <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush,</b> Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and CIA Director George Tenet, as well as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair. Other fixtures are White House advisers such as Karen Hughes and Karl Rove.|$|E
5000|$|Wheaton {{described}} himself as a liberal in 2005. In September 2006, he criticized George W.

[...] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas. Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2003 Senator Bob Graham {{pressed the}} Senate Select Committee on Intelligence {{to release the}} material, per its {{authority}} under Senate Resolution 400, which established the Committee in 1976. However, the committee did not vote and his request was merely denied. Then-chair Senator Pat Roberts, (R-Kan.) and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) wrote Graham that [...] "it is our view that release of additional information from Part Four could adversely affect ongoing counterterrorism efforts." [...] Graham later said the response showed that the Intelligence Committee had shown [...] "a strong deference to the executive branch." [...] In the same month, Senator Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) joined approximately 42 Democratic senators in calling <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> to release the 28-page section which was censored for [...] "national security reasons". Senator Graham stated the refusal [...] "is {{a continuation of the}} pattern of the last seven months-a pattern of delay and excessive use of national security standards to deny the people the knowledge of their vulnerability." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clinton has {{repeatedly}} criticized the Chinese government's human rights record. In 2011, for example, {{she described the}} Chinese government's human rights record as [...] "deplorable" [...] and its crackdown on dissent as [...] "a fool's errand." [...] Clinton has criticized Chinese leader Xi Jinping's record on gender inequality, accusing the Chinese regime of [...] "persecuting feminists," [...] referring to the detention of five Chinese women activists (Wei Tingting and four others) who had campaigned against sexual harassment. As First Lady, she criticized China's one-child policy. [...] She has been criticized by Chinese state media and [...] "government-affiliated opinion writers," [...] {{as well as by}} Chinese social media commentators, for her forceful human rights critiques and her opposition to China's activities in the South China Sea. In 2008, she called <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, citing political violence in Tibet and China's failure to pressure Sudan to halt the violence in Darfur. As Secretary of State, Clinton warned against [...] "new colonialism" [...] in Africa, referring to China's involvement in Africa. On a trip to Africa in 2011, Clinton said that China was not a role model for governance. In a trip to Africa the following year, Clinton launched the trip by contrasting the U.S. commitment to [...] "democracy and human rights" [...] with rival powers' desire [...] "to look the other way and keep the resources flowing"—a comment that was widely interpreted as a veiled attack on China.|$|E
5000|$|The A.V. Club {{wrote of}} the song: [...] "Eminem stops attacking scapegoats and straw men and finally goes after the people who {{actually}} wield power. Over Dr. Dre's apocalyptic production—all rain-clouds and thunderclaps—Eminem launches into a searing, overtly emotional attack <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and his administration's bloodlust and misplaced priorities. Eminem has always been angry, but his anger has never before been this righteous, focused, or plugged in to what matters in American life." [...] Los Angeles Times was somewhat positive too: he stated that Eminem [...] "catches us off-guard with eloquent political reflections in 'Mosh,' his equivalent of Bob Dylan's [...] "The Times They Are A-Changin'." [...] While Eminem's rap doesn't have the timelessness or literary aspirations of the Dylan song, it hits with the visceral charge and topical urgency of the best rap. Lashing out at various social injustices, he leads a legion of young followers toward {{what appears to be}} the kind of violent rebellion one might expect in hard-core rock and rap. Instead, as the video for 'Mosh' shows, their charge is to the voting booth." [...] The Austin Chronicle called the song a [...] "potent anti-Bush rant". [...] SPIN was a bit positive: [...] "The seething anti-Bush single 'Mosh' may not have brought droves of Eminem acolytes to the polls last November, but it suggests that Em—like fellow potty-mouth-turned activist Howard Stern—realizes that his gifts have uses beyond FCC-baiting and fart jokes." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{understanding}} that the efforts made in improving global health affects the health of U. S. citizens, a policy analysis of President Barak Obama 2 ̆ 7 s Global Health Initiative was conducted. Using materials gathered from {{experts in the field}} of health and their findings and recommendations, paired with the current policies of other G 8 countries that pledged to support the efforts of improving global health, the analysis was conducted using four specifically defined criteria. The set criteria determine the appropriateness, responsiveness, effectiveness and equity of Obama 2 ̆ 7 s GHI in comparison to other G 8 country health policies and overall global health priorities. G 8 countries without a specific global health policy, or with a policy that was not in English were excluded from this study and Switzerland, headquarters of the World Health Organization, was added due to its membership in the OECD, {{and the fact that it}} has a specific foreign health policy. In evaluating the U. S. Global Health Initiative it is clear that in terms of implementing foreign policy specific to health, the United States is on the forefront alongside the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Other G 8 Countries have pledged monies and in order to Millennium Development Health Goals by 2015. The U. S. Global Health Policy does not address issues necessary to meet Millennium Development Goals in Health. Instead the Global Health Initiative is focused narrowly on Fighting and rolling back the HIV/Aids Epidemic based <b>on</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> 2 ̆ 7 s PEPFAR policy.
