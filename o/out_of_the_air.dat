5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and {{his friend}} (and CIA agent) Felix Leiter, {{on their way to}} Leiter's wedding in Key West, to have them assist in {{capturing}} drugs lord Franz Sanchez.

Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony.|$|E

Meanwhile, south of Tikrit, the army managed to recapture the town of Mukayshifah in fighting that an army spokesman claimed killed 40 ISIS fighters.|$|E

5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler. As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E

However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honor of the Krusty Krab to the tune of O Tannenbaum. Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having been caught by Mr. Krabs. The eleventy-seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.|$|E

25|$|Graf’s {{technique}} on the forehand {{was unique}} and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, {{she reached the}} point of contact late and typically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> As a result, she hit her forehand with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Složil and Heinz Günthardt, Graf's superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her forehand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of slope soaring, EPP has found {{greatest}} favour and use, as it permits the construction of radio-controlled model gliders of great strength and maneuverability. In consequence, the disciplines of slope combat (the active process of friendly competitors attempting to knock each other's planes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> by direct contact) and slope pylon racing have become commonplace, in direct consequence of the strength characteristics of the material EPP.|$|E

25|$|To {{control or}} {{mitigate}} dust, chlorides need moisture to work effectively so it works better in humid than arid climates. As the humidity increases the chloride draw moisture <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{to keep the}} surface damp and as humidity decreases it diffuses and releases moisture. These naturally occurring equilibrium changes also allow chlorides to {{also be used as}} a dehydrating agent including the drying out of and curing and preservation of hides.|$|E

25|$|The east of {{the state}} is {{dominated}} by the Sierra Madre Occidental, which has less extreme temperatures and, due to the high altitude, relatively more rainfall. As moist air masses move inland from the Pacific and the tropics and are forced against the mountains, they cool and this leads to precipitation, mostly rain but occasional snows in the highest regions. This process takes most of the moisture <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and feeds the various rivers and streams, which empty into Gulf as well as underground aquifers that are under the coastal plain.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{the early}} renown of the raintree stemmed from the {{apocryphal}} story {{that it was a}} panacea for drought stricken districts through the ability of its leaves to condense moisture <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> retain it in large quantities and then expel it through its leaves and trunk. This story, and how it had been disproved, was discussed in two 1911 articles from the Port Douglas and Mossman Record. Otherwise it was seriously considered as a useful crop for the fodder its large seed pods provided for cattle.|$|E
25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
