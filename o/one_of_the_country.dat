It is owned by the state of Luxembourg and by the Luxemburgish railway company: the CFL. It is connected to the German, Belgian and French railway network via several trains per hour. The station is also connected to the French TGV Est network (with which connections are provided to Paris and Strasbourg) and to Basel and Zürich in Switzerland via two daily international trains.|$|E
500|$|... 1. Horner's {{impotence}} trick {{provides the}} play's organising principle and the turning-points of the action. The trick, to pretend impotence {{to be allowed}} where no complete man may go, is (distantly) based on the classic Roman comedy Eunuchus by Terence. The upper-class town rake Harry Horner begins a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible and thus cuckolding or [...] "putting horns on" [...] their husbands: Horner's name serves to alert the audience to what is going on. He spreads a false rumour of his own impotence, to convince married men that he can safely be allowed to socialise with their wives. The rumour is also meant to assist his mass seduction campaign by helping him identify women who are secretly eager for extramarital sex, because those women will react to a supposedly impotent man with tell-tale horror and disgust. This diagnostic trick, which invariably works perfectly, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Country</b> Wifes many running jokes {{at the expense of}} hypocritical upper-class women who are rakes at heart.|$|E
2500|$|Also of note is {{the violin}} heard on [...] "Creep in the Cellar." [...] This {{was the result}} of Butthole Surfers {{purchasing}} a used 16-track tape, on which a country & western band had previously recorded. Upon playing their mix of [...] "Creep in the Cellar," [...] the band discovered they had inadvertently kept <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> band's channels, which contained a backwards violin track. Liking the way it worked with the song, they opted to keep it. They were also too tired to care about editing it out.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{piece of}} good fortune came to me soon after. Dr. Cross again invited me to dine and after dinner as we were driving {{together}} along <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> lanes, the good doctor said, [...] "Mrs. Cross is going up into New Hampshire for the summer and I shall be alone in the house.

The stables, I observed, were singularly large and well kept for a house of its size; but, to my surprise, instead of going to the long range of buildings, the old woman led the way to a small shed.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{went for}} a {{fortnight}} to every racecourse near town and asked after Marvel from bookmakers of his stamp. They all seemed rather surprised at his absence, and suggested that perhaps having failed to pay up here {{he had gone to}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> meetings up in the North. I was up in Yorkshire for a week but with no better result. I came up last night and went to Epsom this morning and there spotted my man.' He then related the conversation he had overheard {{and the manner in which}} he had allowed the man to slip through his fingers. Danvers could not help laughing, though he, too, was vexed.|$|E
60|$|The {{beautiful}} terrace of the Villa Catalano overlooked a small bay {{to which}} it descended by winding walks. The water was deep, and in any other country the bay might have been turned to good account; but bays abounded on this coast, and the people, with many harbors, had no freights to occupy them. This morn, this violet morn, when the balm of the soft breeze refreshed Lothair, and the splendor of the rising sun began to throw a flashing line upon the azure waters, a few fishermen in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> boats happened to come in, about to dry a net upon a sunny bank. The boat was {{what is called a}} speronaro; an open boat worked with oars, but with a lateen sail at the same time when the breeze served.|$|E
60|$|It had {{of course}} been {{necessary}} {{that he should}} form some plan. He proposed to get rooms for one night at the little inn at Ennistimon, to leave his gig there, and then to take <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> cars on to Liscannor. It would, he thought, be best to see the priest first. Let him look at his task which way he would, he found that every {{part of it was}} bad. An interview with Father Marty would be very bad, for he must declare his intentions {{in such a way that}} no doubt respecting them must be left on the priest's mind. He would speak only to three persons;--but to all those three he must now tell the certain truth. There were causes at work which made it impossible that Kate O'Hara should become Countess of Scroope. They might tear him to pieces, but from that decision he would not budge. Subject to that decision they might do with him and with all that belonged to him almost as they pleased. He would explain this first to the priest if it should chance that he found the priest at home.|$|E

6000|$|But {{at another}} time she recurred to her wrongs in all the {{bitterness}} of her father's vindictive purpose. A young couple entered the car at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> stations, and the bride made haste to take off her white bonnet, and lay her cheek on her husband's shoulder, while he passed his arm round her silken waist, and drew her close {{to him on the}} seat, in the loving rapture which is no wise inconvenienced by publicity on our railroad trains. Indeed, after the first general recognition of their condition, no one noticed them except Marcia, who seemed fascinated by the spectacle of their unsophisticated happiness; it must have recalled the blissful abandon of her own wedding journey to her. [...] "Oh, poor fool!" [...] she said to Olive. [...] "Let her wait, and it will not be long before she will know that she had better lean on the empty air than on him. Some day, he will let her fall to the ground, and when she gathers herself up all bruised and bleeding--But he hasn't got the all-believing simpleton to deal with that he used to have; and he shall pay me back for all--drop by drop, and ache for ache!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Every boy {{intended}} {{to belong to}} the Butler Guards when he grew up; and he would have given anything to be the drummer or the marker. These were both boys, and they were just as much dressed up as the Guards themselves, only they had caps instead of hats with plumes. It was strange that the other fellows somehow did not know who these boys were; but they never knew, or at least my boy never knew. They thought more of the marker than of the drummer; for the marker carried a little flag, and when the officers holloed out, [...] "By the left flank--left! Wheel!" [...] he set his flag against his shoulder, and stood marking time with his feet till the soldiers all got by him, and then he ran up to the front rank, with the flag fluttering behind him. The fellows used to wonder how he got to be marker, and to plan how they could get to be markers in other companies, if not in the Butler Guards. There were other companies that used to come to town on the Fourth of July and Muster Day, from smaller places round about; and some of them had richer uniforms: one company had blue coats with gold epaulets, and gold braid going down in loops on the sides of their legs; all the soldiers, of course, had braid straight down the outer seams of their pantaloons. One Muster Day a captain of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> companies came home with my boy's father to dinner; he was in full uniform, and he put his plumed helmet down on the entry table just like any other hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have concluded, {{all things}} considered, to let Copley return {{to you with}} his uncle. Though a pretty good boy in other respects, he {{does not seem to}} be quite willing enough to submit to my direction, to make it {{pleasant}} for me, or safe for him, that we should travel together. I will not say that it is his fault altogether. It is perhaps because there is not difference enough in our ages for him to feel that I ought to have any authority over him. At any rate, he is unwilling to acknowledge my authority, and he takes so many liberties that I am kept in a constant state of anxiety on his account. Besides, I do not think that it is safe for him to be so much at his own disposal. This country is full of thieves, brigands, and rogues, of the most desperate and reckless character; and young men sometimes suffer extremely in falling into their hands. Copley is not aware of the danger, and he thinks that the restraints which I feel compelled to impose upon him are unnecessary and vexatious. Often he will not submit to them. To-day, he has gone down the river on board <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> steamers, without saying any thing to me about it; and, though I do not suppose he will get into any difficulty, in making such an excursion, still the fact that he takes the liberty of doing such things keeps me continually uneasy about him, and there is danger that, sooner or later, he will get into some serious trouble.|$|E

6000|$|... "Money," [...] he remarks, [...] "is easily {{procured}} at Salonica, or Patrass, {{where the}} English have consuls." [...] It {{is much better}} procured, we understand, from the Turkish governors, who never charge discount. The consuls for the English are not of the most magnanimous order of Greeks, and far from being so liberal, generally speaking; although there are, in course, some exceptions, and Strané of Patras has been more honourably mentioned.--After having observed that [...] "horses seem the best mode of conveyance in Greece," [...] Mr. Gell proceeds: [...] "Some travellers would prefer an English saddle; but a saddle of this sort is always objected to by {{the owner of the}} horse, and not without reason," [...] etc. This, we learn, is far from being the case; and, indeed, for a very simple reason, an English saddle must seem to be preferable to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> because it is much lighter. When, too, Mr. Gell calls the postillion [...] "Menzilgi," [...] he mistakes him for his betters; Serrugees are postillions; Menzilgis are postmasters.--Our traveller was fortunate in his Turks, who are hired to walk {{by the side of the}} baggage-horses. They [...] "are certain," [...] he says, [...] "of performing their engagement without grumbling." [...] We apprehend that this is by no means certain:--but Mr. Gell is perfectly right in preferring a Turk to a Greek for this purpose; and in his general recommendation to take a Janissary on the tour: who, we may add, should be suffered to act as he pleases, since nothing is to be done by gentle means, or even by offers of money, at the places of accommodation. A courier, to be sent on before to the place at which the traveller intends to sleep, is indispensable to comfort; but no tourist should be misled by the author's advice to suffer the Greeks to gratify their curiosity, in permitting them to remain for some time about him on his arrival at an inn. They should be removed as soon as possible; for, as to the remark that [...] "no stranger would think of intruding when a room is pre-occupied," [...] our informants were not so well convinced of that fact.|$|E
