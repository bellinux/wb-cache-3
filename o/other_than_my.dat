25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Scott Lasley, a {{political}} science professor at Western Kentucky University and chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed in the context of the string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

[...] "I have not spoken to Baron von Schoenvorts <b>other</b> <b>than</b> in your presence when first we came aboard the U-33. And please, when you address me, remember that to <b>others</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> intimates I am Miss La Rue." ...|$|R

2500|$|Gabor's divorces {{inspired}} {{her to make}} numerous quotable puns and innuendos about her marital (and extramarital) history. She commented: [...] "I am a marvelous housekeeper: Every time I leave a man I keep his house." [...] When asked, [...] "How many husbands have you had?", she was quoted as responding, [...] "You mean <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own?" [...] Gabor later claimed {{to have had a}} sexual encounter with her stepson, Nicky.|$|E
2500|$|In Tyler’s works, the {{characters}} are the driving forces behind the stories and {{the starting point for}} her writing: [...] “I do make a point of writing down every imaginable facet of my characters before I begin a book, trying to get to know them so I can figure out how they’ll react in any situation…..My reason for writing now is to live lives <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own, and I do that by burrowing deeper and deeper….till I reach the center of those lives.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre anecdotes Calderone related was that of Riina giving a tearful eulogy at the funeral of Calderone's murdered brother, even though Riina himself had ordered the killing. Calderone also said that, when Riina {{set his sights on}} marrying his sweetheart, Ninetta, the young lady's family objected to the union. Calderone quoted Riina as saying [...] "I don't want any woman <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> Ninetta, and if they [...] don't let me marry her, I'll have to kill some people." [...] Ninetta's family soon dropped any {{opposition}} to Riina's matrimonial plans.|$|E

"It {{would be}} thought a Piece of Hypocrisy and pharisaical Ostentation in me, if I should say, that I print these Distichs more {{with a view}} to the Good of <b>others</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot say it; for I confess, I have so great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sense of the People of this and the neighoring Provinces, that I expect to sell a very good impression." ...|$|R

2500|$|Author Michael Abrash, in his 1997 book Graphics Programming Black Book, says [...] "Little <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> DDJ (Dr. Dobb's Journal) columns {{has been}} {{published}} about (Mode X), although Bridges has widely distributed his code {{for a number of}} undocumented 256-color resolutions, and I’d like to acknowledge the influence of his code on the mode set routine presented in [...]" [...] The codes to which Abrash refers are Mode X 360x480 256-color mode codes Bridges included with VGAKIT, and worked on any VGA, not just SVGAs. [...] Abrash's DDJ articles were published circa 1991 before being compiled into GPBB.|$|E
2500|$|She has {{railed against}} the [...] "anaemic" [...] model figure, noting in an {{interview}} with the Daily Telegraph that she herself is a [...] "curvy size 12". In a 2010 op-ed for The Independent, Nash wrote, [...] "I spend so much time ... trying to get the world to judge me on anything <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> breasts and body shape." ... I am liberated by many things ... a world where I can be free sexually, I can wear revealing clothing if I want to, I can buy condoms, go on the pill, get the coil, talk about sex, write about it if I wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chhattisgarh has a {{significant}} role in the life of lord Rama. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother Lakshaman had started his Vanvas (exile) in the Bastar region (more precisely Dandakaranya region) of Chhattisgarh. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable place is Shivrinarayan which is nearby Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady Shabari. When Ram visited Shabari she said [...] "I do not have anything to offer <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord." [...] Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, [...] "nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy." ...|$|E

6000|$|When I {{remembered that}} this man had had the audacity to {{complain}} of our gardener's obstinacy, my tongue itched to [...] "go on" [...] in <b>other</b> words <b>than</b> <b>my</b> mistress's. This time, however, my Christianity held firm. I proceeded steadily with her ladyship's letter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is not so, lord. I am your daughter, and you {{are none}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> father. I knew you when I first saw your face, though you did not know me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No man lives who can harm {{me while}} a blade hangs at my side," [...] {{answered}} the boy, [...] "and as for doing as you bid, I take orders from no man <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> father." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I {{was covered with}} {{confusion}} and remorse. The man to whose company I had objected was none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own father, and as he approached I {{could see that he}} was wounded in the right leg.|$|E
60|$|Yes, good reader, that {{stranger}} {{was none}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> myself, and <b>my</b> companion was Salamander. To account for our sudden appearance I must explain.|$|R
6000|$|His legs had {{need to be}} strong, {{however long}} and thin they were; for they had to support him through many {{difficulties}} on the fiery sands of Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, deserted, and seemed to melt away. But his prowess made light of it, and he said, 'I will go on, if I go on with no <b>other</b> follower <b>than</b> <b>my</b> groom!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I had {{gradually}} {{formed the}} habit of talking with Walkirk on <b>other</b> subjects <b>than</b> <b>my</b> travels, and one evening I mentioned to him some of the embarrassments and annoyances to which I had been subjected during the day, {{on account of the}} varied character of my affairs. Walkirk sat for a minute or two, his chin in his hand, gazing steadfastly upon the carpet; then he spoke:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{you shall}} {{remain at the}} head of the Treasury Department is a {{question}} which I will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> judgment of the public service, and, in that view, I do not perceive occasion for a change.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] {{said the}} little, armored man irritably. [...] "I cannot bide here forever. Make up thy mind; it be {{nothing to me}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> revenge, and if thou wilst not do it, I shall hire the {{necessary}} ruffians and then not even thou shalt see Bertrade de Montfort more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are in no}} {{position}} to deliver insults," [...] he said.

60|$|I {{have often}} laughed over Jaap's management, though I {{would not permit}} him to repeat it. Passing {{the house of a}} man of better {{condition}} than common, I presented myself to its owner, though an entire stranger to him, and told him my story. Without asking any <b>other</b> confirmation <b>than</b> <b>my</b> word, this gentleman lent me five silver dollars, which answered all my present purposes, and which, I trust, it is scarcely necessary to say, were duly repaid.|$|R
60|$|There {{is little}} need why I {{should go into}} detail {{concerning}} this part of my poor attempt at playing the spy, for it had no <b>other</b> result <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own discomfort for the time being, and served to show me, if indeed I needed to be shown after all Saul had done {{in the town of}} York, that the lad who gives way to his temper, whatever the situation, acts foolishly and to his own harm.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have left}} me,--utterly in the cold--more desolate than I am here even though I should {{spend the night}} among the trees. But I will go back, and will tell your father everything. If <b>my</b> father were <b>other</b> <b>than</b> he is,--if <b>my</b> brother were better to me, {{you would not have}} done this." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{due course}} I reached Nodwengu without accident, having sent forward {{one of my}} hunters to report my {{approach}} to Panda. When my wagons arrived outside the Great Place they were met by none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> old friend, Maputa, he who had brought me back the pills before our attack upon Bangu.|$|E
60|$|Within, pillowed on soft cushions, {{and covered}} with a mantle woven of white natural fleece sprigged with tiny sprays of pine wrought in gold, lay the body of a woman--none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> {{beautiful}} visitor. She was marble white, and her long black eyelashes lay on her white cheeks as though she slept.|$|E
6000|$|On one {{of these}} October days, when I was trying to satisfy my discontented Dora by a game at ball upon the steps, to my extreme astonishment I beheld a white pony, led by Harold, and seated on the same pony, no <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>my</b> dear little friend, unseen for four months, Viola Tracy! ...|$|E
60|$|But {{in order}} to make some excuse for being more {{speculative}} <b>than</b> <b>others</b> of <b>my</b> condition, I desire your lordship's pardon, while I am doing a very foolish thing, which is, to give you some little account of myself.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 Cogle {{immigrated to}} New York and in 1979 {{he joined the}} United States Army. He was sent to South Carolina for basic {{training}} and then to Fort Lee in New Jersey to do an eight-month course in clerical and book-keeping studies. On finishing the eight-month course, Cogle was deployed to Wiesbaden in Germany where he continued to write songs, recording them to tape cassettes; he also searched for his records for as he says, [...] "I {{did not know where}} else <b>other</b> <b>than</b> Jamaica <b>my</b> records were." ...|$|R
6000|$|I say this, to shew that I had no <b>other</b> bias <b>than</b> <b>my</b> {{own opinion}} of persons and affairs. I {{preserved}} {{several of the}} opposite party in their employments, who were persons of wit and learning, particularly Mr. Addison and Mr. Congreve, neither of whom were ever in any danger from the treasurer, who much esteemed them both; and, by his lordship's commands, I brought the latter to dine with him. Mr. Steele might have been safe enough, if his continually repeated indiscretions, and a zeal mingled with scurrilities, had not forfeited all title to lenity.[4] ...|$|R
