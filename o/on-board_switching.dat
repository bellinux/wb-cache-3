40|$|The use of <b>on-board</b> <b>switches</b> {{for space}} {{applications}} {{is not yet}} widespread because efficient switches for space applications do not exit yet. Unlike terrestrial switches, basically gigabit switches with almost unlimited buffer capacity, switches used inside a satellite payload suffer from {{the constraints of the}} space environment and from the following limitations: weight, power consumption, buffer capacity, frequency and temperature of functioning, available technology. Therefore, the architecture of the <b>on-board</b> <b>switch</b> should remain quite simple, and simultaneously the switch should provide some good performance. Moreover interoperability between the satellite system and the terrestrial networks should be provided. The satellite system possibly acts as an access network for the terminal (e. g.

It means that the satellite system should support efficiently and transparently the QoS mechanisms implemented in all the overlying terrestrial networks. Especially, the satellite system should provide compatibility with connection oriented QoS mechanisms such as Integrated Services (Intserv [2]) and aggregated QoS mechanisms such as Diffserv [3] for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Therefore, it is quite straightforward that the <b>on-board</b> <b>switch</b> should fulfil two opposite requirements: on the one hand, as a key component of the satellite system, it should contribute to the QoS support for the high layer applications but o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Satellites are {{expected}} to have an important role in providing the Internet protocol (IP) multicast service to complementing next-generation terrestrial networks. In this paper, we focus on the deployment of IP multicast over the next generation of digital video broadcasting-based geosynchronous earth orbit satellites supporting multiple spot beams and <b>on-board</b> <b>switching</b> technologies. We propose a new encapsulation scheme optimized for IP multicast, which has two distinct modes enabling two alternative <b>on-board</b> <b>switching</b> approaches: the selfswitching and the label-switching. We also detail a set of mechanisms and protocols for ground stations, {{as well as for the}} on-board processor to allow an efficient multicast forwarding in this type of environment, while reducing the load of control and data messages in the satellite segment, and building efficient multicast delivery trees reaching only the spot beams containing at least one member of the corresponding multicast session. To integrate satellite links in the terrestrial Internet, we present satellite multicast adaptation protocol (SMAP), a protocol which is implemented in satellite stations to process incoming protocol independent multicast-sparse mode (PIM-SM) messages sent by terrestrial nodes to the satellite system. SMAP helps to update the tables required for the mapping between IP packets and MPEG- 2 data segments, their switching on board the satellite, and their filtering at the satellite receivers.

40|$|ATM is {{specified}} as {{a standard}} for multimedia communications, which provides universal information exchange independent of the end system {{and the types of}} traffic (data, audio, video). In addition, it is suitable for high speed networks, and provides flexibility and scalability in the network design. Satellite communication systems have also considered ATM as a technology for the global network infrastructure. The role of satellites have changed from purely transparent communication nodes to fast packet switching nodes in the sky. An ATM <b>on-board</b> satellite <b>switch</b> {{can be seen as a}} key network entity for the future global communication systems. It is a promising means to increase the bandwidth efficiency and to provide QoS guarantees. But, because the resources of satellite communication systems are limited and more expensive when compared to those of terrestrial systems, the design of an ATM <b>on-board</b> <b>switch</b> needs careful considerations. The long propagation delay, the maximum utilisation of the network resources and the QoS guarantees of multimedia services are considered as the main design parameters. To meet these requirements, a satellite system should employ a robust congestion control scheme.

The assignment of different bandwidths to different users is achieved by merging several elementary channels (granules) to one wideband channel, as required. Hence, emerging communication satellite on-board process-ing systems have to digitally process higher and higher bandwidths under the constraints of high flexibility and yet low complexity. For instance, for the Distributed Network Access Scenario, the requirements are most challenging for the forward link. Incoming 1 GHz-signals are sampled with a sampling frequency of fi= 2. 4 GHz. Each digitised FDM signal is always channelised by a frequency demultiplexer (FDMUX) to granularity level, i. e. decom-posed into sub-signals of identical bandwidths (channel spacing). For digital splitting of the FDMUX input signal, three cases must be distinguished: i) All granules represent signals (carriers) of independent users, ii) all granules belong to a single wideband carrier of a spe-cific user, and iii), as a combination of the first two cases, the FDM input signal is composed of granular (case i) and wideband signals of bandwidths ranging from two to ten granules (case ii). A subsequent <b>on-board</b> <b>switch</b> feeds FDM remultiplexers (FMUX) with the assigned granules to form downlink user beams.
