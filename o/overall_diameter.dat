40|$|Abstract: Tire {{deflection}} {{is a key}} parameter {{and many}} equations have been developed based on it to evaluate the tractive performance of bias-ply and radial-ply tires. As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () of radial-ply tire based on section width (b), <b>overall</b> unloaded <b>diameter</b> (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four radial-ply tires with different section width and/or <b>overall</b> unloaded <b>diameter</b> were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection of radial-ply tire based on section width, <b>overall</b> unloaded <b>diameter,</b> inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

40|$|The formation, {{elongation}} and periclinal growths, and morphology {{of roots}} in trifoliate orange grafted with satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc. cv. Okitsu Wase) were studied under {{different levels of}} culture solution salinity. Root formation and root elongation were highest in no-salt-control treatment which decreased as the culture solution salinity was increased up to 50 mM. Both stelar and <b>overall</b> <b>diameters</b> gradually increased towards the root base under control. While these diameters became considerably higher near the root tip and increased slightly towards the root base under saline solutions. This increasing trend was drastically slowed by higher doses of salinity. The ratio of stelar to <b>overall</b> <b>diameters</b> fairly increased towards the root base under control but tended to be similar throughout the root tip in saline solutions. The continued growth of roots under control was accompanied by the distinct removal of older rootcap cells and the observation of intact epidermal cells. In contrast, epidermal cell dehydration initiated under 10 mM NaCl solution. The roots subjected to 25 and 50 mM of NaCl attributed root tip injuries along with severe epidermal cell dehydration and cell death even at short exposure. The formation of holes on the epidermis and distinct malformation of root tip increased considerably with respect to both increased salinity from 25 to 50 mM and the exposure time of roots to these saline solutions...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{anatomy of}} the vermiform {{appendix}} shows variations in its macroscopic dimensions and microscopic features, {{some of which have}} potentials of influencing the clinical aspects of the appendix. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} find out some microscopic features of appendix and evaluate the correlation between the microscopic features of the appendix and the age of the subjects and to determine whether these findings should influence the clinical implications of appendix. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, thirty adult males’ (age from 18 to 67 years) postmortem appendices and adnexa from Bangladeshi victims of road traffic accidents were sectioned at the base, midzone and tip stained with H+E stain and examined under microscope. Measurements were taken at the base, at the midzone and at the tip of the appendix, and the mean of the three measurements was considered as the overall value. Results: The overall number of mucosal glands in a section ranged from 42. 33 to 130. 00 and the number of the germinal centres varied between 2. 33 and 10. 00. The <b>overall</b> luminal <b>diameter</b> ranged between 1764. 58 and 3208. 33 µm. The <b>overall</b> luminal <b>diameter</b> in more than 52 % of cases was between 2700. 00 and 3299. 99 µm with a median value of 2750 µm. Conclusion: The overall number of mucosal glands showed a tendency towards a positive correlation with age. The <b>overall</b> luminal <b>diameter</b> and the <b>overall</b> number of germinal centres showed a tendency towards a negative correlation with the age. However, none of the tendencies of correlation reached statistically any significant level...|$|R
40|$|Anthracnose fruit rot is an {{economically}} important disease that affects pepper production in Indonesia. Strong resistance to two causal pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. capsici, {{was found in}} an accession of Capsicum chinense. The inheritance of this resistance was studied in an F 2 population derived from a cross of this accession with an Indonesian hot pepper variety (Capsicum annuum) using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. In laboratory tests where ripe fruits were artificially inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. capsici, three resistance-related traits were scored: the infection frequency, the true lesion diameter (averaged over all lesions that actually developed), and the <b>overall</b> lesion <b>diameter</b> (averaged over all inoculation points, including those that did not develop lesions). One main QTL was identified with highly significant and large effects on all three traits after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides and on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici. Three other QTL with smaller effects were found for <b>overall</b> lesion <b>diameter</b> and true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, two of which also {{had an effect on}} infection frequency. Interestingly, the resistant parent carried a susceptible allele for a QTL for all three traits that was closely linked to the main QTL. The results with C. capsici were based on less observations and therefore less informative. Although the main QTL was shown to have an effect on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici, no significant QTL were identified for <b>overall</b> lesion <b>diameter</b> or infection frequenc...|$|R
