40|$|A hs tract. Objective. Analysis of {{possibilities}} of arthrosonography <b>of</b> knee <b>joints</b> for ihe diagnosis of synovitis on {{early stages of}} gonarthritis. Material and methods. Ultrasound study <b>of</b> knee <b>joints</b> {{was carried out in}} 77 patients with gonarthritis of 1 - 11 Kellgren R-stage, in 12 pts X-ray symptoms of gonarthritis were absent. Study was carried out on ALOKA- 2200 (Japan) using method of two-measured tomography (В-method) with the help of linear sensor with frequency 7. 5 MHz in real time. Frontal and posterior (popliteal) surfaces <b>of</b> knee <b>joint</b> were studied using longitudinal and transversal projections in lying position with maximal extension <b>of</b> knee <b>joint.</b> Results. It was found that in the group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> with clinical synovitis the II radiologic stage of gonarthritis (58, 3 %) prevailed, and in the group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> without clinical symptoms of synovitis the 1 st radiological stage of gonarthritis (53 %) prevailed. In the group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> with clinical synovitis ultrasound synovitis symptoms were found in 17 joints which is 70. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> with clinical synovitis (24) and 11 % of total number <b>of</b> examined <b>joints</b> (154). Fluid in Ihc space <b>of</b> knee <b>joints</b> was localized prevalently over condyle of the Libia (70. 8 %), in 16. 6 % fluid was found also in b. suprapatellaris. Enlargement of synovia more than 3 mm prevalently on account of oedema was found in 79. 8 % whereas in the group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> without clinical symptoms of synovitis only in 23 %. In the group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> without clinical synovitis subclinical synovitis, i. e. synovitis found in US study was revealed in 34 joints which was 26. 1 % of the number <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> without clinical synovitis (130) and 22 % of total number <b>of</b> examined <b>joints</b> (154). Enlargement <b>of</b> synovia more than 3 mm in this group <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> was found in 23 % joints, namely in patients with subclinical synovitis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Joints in {{deployable}} structures can {{degrade the}} stiffness and {{the stability of}} spacecraft. In this study, the nonlinear stiffness <b>of</b> spherical <b>joints</b> is investigated. The traditional contact model <b>of</b> spherical <b>joints</b> based on non-conforming contact assumption is presented. A new contact model for spherical joints based on the Winkler model and geometric constraints is established to calculate the stiffness <b>of</b> spherical <b>joints</b> with small clearances. The finite element model (FEM) <b>of</b> spherical <b>joints</b> is built to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} theoretical model. The effects of the clearance and the contact force <b>of</b> spherical <b>joints</b> on the deformation <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> are investigated. When compared with FEM results, the error of the new spherical model is smaller than that of the traditional contact model when the clearance <b>of</b> spherical <b>joint</b> is not excessively large. The new contact model for spherical joint is more accurate than the traditional contact model when the clearance <b>of</b> spherical <b>joint</b> is large...|$|R
