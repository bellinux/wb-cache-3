40|$|Independent studies {{indicate}} that expression of sialylated fucosylated mucins by human carcinomas portends a poor prognosis because of enhanced metastatic spread of tumor cells, that carcinoma metastasis in mice is facilitated by formation of tumor cell complexes with blood platelets, and that metastasis can be attenuated by a background of P-selectin deficiency or by treatment with heparin. The effects of heparin are not primarily due to its anticoagulant action. Other explanations have been suggested but not proven. Here, we bring together all these unexplained and seemingly disparate observations, showing that heparin treatment attenuates tumor metastasis in mice by inhibiting P-selectin-mediated interactions of platelets with carcinoma cell-surface mucin ligands. Selective removal of tumor mucin P-selectin ligands, a single heparin dose, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> P-selectin deficiency each reduces tumor cell-platelet interactions in vitro and in vivo. Although each of these maneuvers reduced the in vivo interactions {{for only a few}} hours, all markedly reduce long-term organ colonization by tumor cells. Three-dimensional reconstructions by using volume-rendering software show that each situation interferes with formation of the platelet “cloak” around tumor cells while permitting an increased interaction of monocytes (macrophage precursors) with the malignant cells. Finally, we show that human P-selectin is even more sensitive to heparin than mouse P-selectin, giving significant inhibition at concentrations that are in the clinically acceptable range. We suggest that heparin therapy for metastasis prevention in humans be revisited, with these mechanistic paradigms in mind...|$|E

The additional presence of AZT-mutations can partially neutralize this deficit, which helps to explain the concurrent presence of these changes in resistant isolates.

40|$|Korean Through Folktales {{consists}} of four chapters and each centers on a famous Korean folktale. The lessons and values that famous folktales teach are embedded and permeated in {{various aspects of the}} Koran culture. Using folktales in the curriculum will provide an engaging way to expose students to a slice of the target culture that native Koreans are naturally exposed to at an early age. Through the selected folktales and various activities offered in the book, students can gain cultural knowledge and insights into traditional and cultural values while they are given linguistic lessons to reinforce their acquired skills and to apply the learned materials in an integrated approach. Korean Through Folktales is designed to accompany 1 st-year, 2 nd-year, and 3 rd-year Korean courses offered at Portland State University. However, any Korean teacher can adopt this book to supplement his/her course materials at elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. There are four chapters in the book. Each chapter will note main themes of a widely known folktale introduced in the chapter, followed by the links to several videos to watch and get a gist <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> the story. The ensuing section will introduce important elements and symbolism embedded in the story so as to provide insights and to enhance the depth of appreciation. After that, three versions of the folktale are presented for different levels, followed by grammar lessons, exercises, and tasks. Traces of folktales and allusions to them are evident in cultural products that many students enjoy, such as dramas, movies, and music. Therefore, knowledge in folktales will help students make cultural connections as well as enrich their experience of learning the Korean language. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is concern}} that {{existing}} models of acute hospital care will become unworkable as the health service admits {{an increasing number}} of frail older people with complex health needs, and that there is inadequate evidence to guide the planning of acute hospital level services. We aim to evaluate whether geriatrician-led admission avoidance to hospital at home is an effective alternative to hospital admission. Methods/Design: We are conducting a multi-site randomised open trial of geriatrician-led admission avoidance hospital at home, compared with admission to hospital. We are recruiting older people with markers of frailty or prior dependence who have been referred to admission avoidance hospital at home for an acute medical event. This includes patients presenting with delirium, functional decline, dependence, falls, immobility <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> dementia presenting with physical disease. Participants are randomised using a computerised random number generator to geriatrician-led admission avoidance hospital at home or a control group of inpatient admission in a 2 : 1 ratio in favour of the intervention. The primary endpoint ‘living at home’ (the inverse of death or living in a residential care setting) is measured at 6 months follow-up, and we also collect data on this outcome at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of delirium, mortality, new long-term residential care, cognitive impairment, activities of daily living, quality of life and quality-adjusted survival, length of stay, readmission or transfer to hospital.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} cosmological {{constraints}} derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple LCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic {{parameters of the}} model {{are consistent with the}} three-year data and now better constrained: Omega_b h^ 2 = 0. 02273 +- 0. 00062, Omega_c h^ 2 = 0. 1099 +- 0. 0062, Omega_L = 0. 742 +- 0. 030, n_s = 0. 963 + 0. 014 - 0. 015, tau = 0. 087 +- 0. 017, sigma_ 8 = 0. 796 +- 0. 036. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, tau> 0, at 5 sigma significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z_reion = 11. 0 +- 1. 4 with 68 % confidence. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z= 6 at more than 3. 5 sigma significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to foreground treatment of tau~ 0. 01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale CMB data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence {{for the first time in}} the CMB power spectrum for a non-zero cosmic neutrino background, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit LCDM model with N_eff= 0 at > 99. 5 % confidence, and N_eff > 2. 3 (95 % CL) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r < 0. 43 (95 % CL), for power-law models.

40|$|The optical {{consequences}} of the violation of thermodynamic equilibrium in a crystal are investigated. If this violation occurs it may lead to breaking of time reversibility. As {{a result of this}} the internal symmetry of the optical susceptibility tensors changes and new "forbidden" tensor components arise. This gives way to some forbidden specular polarization phenomena in optics, observation of which may be used for diagnostics of the crystal equilibrium. The wave theory of normal reflection from a crystal interface including consideration {{of the role of the}} forbidden components is developed. Two mechanisms for forbidden specular polarization effects are identified, one due to the appearance of a contribution to the dielectric tensor which is antisymmetric under interchange of tensor indices, and another associated with the symmetric contribution to the nonlocal optical response. Crystal point group analysis shows that, depending on crystal class, forbidden specular polarization effects may be seen with <b>or</b> without <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> "conventional" optical activity. The physical conditions for their observation are discussed and recent polarization-sensitive experiments in optically excited GaAs crystals are explained in terms of the developed theory.

The stimuli were presented from a circular ring of loudspeakers, either in quiet <b>or</b> in <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> spatially diffuse babble. Listeners were required to identify the loudspeaker from which they heard the sound. Localization dominance was quantified by the weighting factor c [B. G. Shinn-Cunningham et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 93, 2923 - 2932 (1993) ]. The results demonstrated large individual differences: Some listeners showed near-perfect localization dominance (c near 1) but many showed a much reduced effect. Two-thirds (64 / 93) of the listeners gave a value of c of at least 0. 75. There was a significant correlation with hearing loss, such that better hearing listeners showed better localization dominance. One of the items of the self-report questionnaire ("Do you have the impression of sounds being exactly where you would expect them to be?") showed a significant correlation with the experimental results.

Detailed site-specific reference glycoprofiles of purified basigin were manually established using ion-trap CID–MS/MS and high-resolution Q-Exactive Orbitrap HCD–MS/MS of tryptic N-glycopeptides and released N-glycans. The micro- and macroheterogeneous basigin N-glycosylation was site-specifically glycoprofiled using Byonic with <b>or</b> without <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> complex peptides using Q-Exactive Orbitrap HCD–MS/MS. The automated glycoprofiling efficiencies were assessed against the site-specific reference glycoprofiles and target/decoy proteome databases. Within the limits of this single glycoprotein analysis, the search criteria and confidence thresholds (Byonic scores) recommended by the vendor provided high glycoprofiling accuracy and coverage (both > 80 %) and low peptide FDRs (< 1 %). The data complexity, search parameters including search space (proteome/glycome size), mass tolerance and peptide modifications, and confidence thresholds affected the automated glycoprofiling efficiency and analysis time.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish the mechanism responsible for the increased apolipoprotein (apo) A-II levels caused by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib. Nineteen subjects with low HDL cholesterol (< 40 mg/dl), nine of whom were also treated with 20 mg of atorvastatin daily, received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 120 mg of torcetrapib daily for the next 4 weeks. Six subjects in the nonatorvastatin cohort participated in a third phase, in which they received 120 mg of torcetrapib twice daily for 4 weeks. At the end of each phase, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of [5, 5, 5 - 2 H 3]l-leucine to determine the kinetics of HDL apoA-II. Relative to placebo, torcetrapib significantly increased apoA-II concentrations by reducing HDL apoA-II catabolism in the atorvastatin (− 9. 4 %, P < 0. 003) and nonatorvastatin once- (− 9. 9 %, P = 0. 02) and twice- (− 13. 2 %, P = 0. 02) daily cohorts. Torcetrapib significantly increased the amount of apoA-II in the α- 2 -migrating subpopulation of HDL when given as monotherapy (27 %, P < 0. 02; 57 %, P < 0. 003) <b>or</b> on <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> atorvastatin (28 %, P < 0. 01). In contrast, torcetrapib reduced concentrations of apoA-II in α- 3 -migrating HDL, with mean reductions of − 14 % (P = 0. 23), − 18 % (P < 0. 02), and − 18 % (P < 0. 01) noted during the atorvastatin and nonatorvastatin 120 mg once- and twice-daily phases, respectively. Our findings indicate that CETP inhibition increases plasma concentrations of apoA-II by delaying HDL apoA-II catabolism and significantly alters the remodeling of apoA-II-containing HDL subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{previous}} studies clinical signs or amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) -based signs of encephalopathy {{were used to}} select infants with perinatal asphyxia for treatment with hypothermia. AIM: The objective {{of this study was}} to compare Thompson encephalopathy scores and aEEG, and relate both to outcome. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thompson scores, aEEG, and outcome were compared in 122 infants with perinatal asphyxia and therapeutic hypothermia. Of these 122 infants, 41 died and 7 had an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Thompson scores were higher in infants with more abnormal aEEG background patterns (ANOVA, p < 0. 001). The ROC analysis demonstrated that a Thompson score of 11 <b>or</b> higher <b>or</b> <b>an</b> aEEG <b>background</b> pattern <b>of</b> continuous low voltage or worse was associated with an adverse outcome (AUC 0. 84 for both). CONCLUSIONS: High Thompson scores and <b>a</b> suppressed aEEG <b>background</b> pattern are associated with an adverse outcome after perinatal asphyxia and therapeutic hypothermia. Further studies are needed to identify the best technique with which to select patients for therapeutic hypothermia...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{differential resistance}} responses of carbon black−poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (PEVA) composite vapor detectors were evaluated {{in response to}} short rise time (< 2 ms for a 17 ms pulse length) square pulses of acetone, n-hexane, methanol, 2 -propanol, <b>or</b> toluene, in <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> synthetic air. The use of ultrathin films, along with a rapid vapor delivery system, facilitated measurement of the rapid time response available from this exemplary carbon black−polymer composite chemiresistive film {{for the detection of}} common organic vapors. Detectors formed from very thin (< 200 nm) PEVA−carbon black composites produced steady-state responses within 17 ms upon exposure to methanol and produced steady-state responses within 90 ms upon exposure to toluene, acetone, and n-hexane. In accord with Fickian diffusion, the response times of the relative differential resistance of PEVA−carbon black detectors to analyte exposures were proportional to the square of the film thickness, l, in the range 510 ≤ l ≤ 5700 nm. Additionally, the relative differential resistance versus time profiles of PEVA−carbon black detectors were well fit by a simple finite difference model based on Fickian analyte diffusion, using a single analyte diffusion coefficient, for a variety of different film thicknesses and analyte concentrations...|$|R
40|$|This article preliminarily {{considers}} whether commercializing {{floating type}} {{offshore wind power}} generation can be realized in Goto City in Nagasaki Prefecture, <b>or</b> not. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> this study, Goto City is an island municipality and suffering from depopulation because of low birth rate and longevity, and also, due to economic slide and decrease in employment. Goto City started the pilot project of floating type offshore wind power generation in 2009, supported by the Ministry of Environment. Since {{the result of the}} project was successful, they have been expecting they can take advantage of it for local revitalization. This paper, first of all, overviews recent trends and surroundings about offshore wind power generation in both Japan {{and the rest of the}} world. This survey reveals significance and potential of this offshore project for Japan and Goto City, and finds out some challenges for the future. Next, out of several issues, this study focuses on the initial cost and considers how they can collect investment for expanding floating type offshore wind power generation. This article also refers to the possibility of communal investment as one of the ways to contribute to local revitalization. Finally, this study brings up several policy proposals for the project expansion in a way to benefit locality...|$|R
5000|$|Artists that {{experienced}} {{success in the}} industry prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, such as David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Don Henley of The Eagles, have brought to light what they believe are contributing to the nationwide homogenization of music. Crosby tells PBS in an interview, [...] "When it all started, record companies - {{and there were many}} of them, and this was a good thing - were run by people who loved records, people like Ahmet Ertegun, who ran Atlantic Records, who were record collectors. They got in it because they loved music.... Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants." [...] This view highlights a common theme that creativity and passion have been subverted by the financial incentives of corporatized media companies. Chief executives of large record labels often have no musical <b>or</b> cultural <b>background.</b> <b>A</b> head <b>of</b> Universal Vivendi, Jean René Fourtou, was previously in pharmaceuticals. Gunter Thielen, the former head of Bertelsmann, previously managed the company's printing and industrial operations.|$|R
40|$|Background Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) {{is mainly}} {{diagnosed}} using fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This {{most common form}} of well-differentiated thyroid cancer occurs with <b>or</b> without <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> benign thyroid goiter (BTG). Methods In the present study, a gel-based proteomics analysis was performed to analyse the expression of proteins in tissue and serum samples of PTC patients with (PTCb; n = 6) and without a history of BTG (PTCa; n = 8) relative to patients with BTG (n = 20). This was followed by confirmation of the levels of proteins which showed significant altered abundances of more than two-fold difference (p < 0. 01) in the tissue and serum samples of the same subjects using ELISA. Results The data of our study showed that PTCa and PTCb distinguish themselves from BTG in the types of tissue and serum proteins of altered abundance. While higher levels of alpha- 1 antitrypsin (A 1 AT) and heat shock 70 kDa protein were associated with PTCa, lower levels of A 1 AT, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E 2 N seemed apparent in the PTCb. In case of the serum proteins, higher abundances of A 1 AT and alpha 1 -beta glycoprotein were detected in PTCa, while PTCb was associated with enhanced apolipoprotein A-IV and alpha 2 -HS glycoprotein (AHSG). The different altered expression of tissue and serum A 1 AT as well as serum AHSG between PTCa and PTCb patients were also validated by ELISA. Discussion The distinctive altered abundances of the tissue and serum proteins form preliminary indications that PTCa and PTCb are two distinct cancers of the thyroid that are etiologically and mechanistically different although it is currently not possible to rule out that they may also be due other reasons such as the different stages of the malignant disease. These proteins stand to have a potential use as tissue or serum biomarkers to discriminate the three different thyroid neoplasms although this requires further validation in clinically representative populations...|$|R
40|$|Maize is {{a global}} crop and a {{powerful}} system among grain crops for genetic and genomic studies. However, the development of novel biological tools and resources {{to aid in the}} functional identification of gene sequences is strongly needed. Towards this goal, we have developed a collection of maize marker lines for studying native gene expression in specific cell types and subcellular compartments using fluorescent proteins (FP). To catalog FP expression, we have developed a public repository, the Maize Cell Genomics (MCG) Database, ([URL] to organize a large dataset of confocal images generated from the maize marker lines. To date, the collection represents major subcellular structures and also developmentally important progenitor cell populations. The resource is available to the research community, for example to study protein localization or interactions under various experimental conditions <b>or</b> mutant <b>backgrounds.</b> <b>A</b> subset <b>of</b> the marker lines {{can also be used to}} induce mis-expression of target genes through a transactivation system. For future directions, the image repository can be expanded to accept new image submissions from the research community, and to perform customized large-scale computational image analysis. This community resource will provide a suite of new tools for gaining biological insights by following the dynamics of protein expression at the sub-cellular, cellular, and tissue levels...|$|R
