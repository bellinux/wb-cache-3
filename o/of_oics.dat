The use cases that the OICS will support emerge from the collaboration of all work packages. After fruitful discussions between all partners of work package 1, it was decided to conceive the first generation of the OICS as a meta-repository providing search functionality. Technologically, it would be based on metadata harvesting and provide a simple search interface for querying this metadata. This should build the foundation for the implementation of more sophisticated use cases that are currently collected by work package leaders, and are analyzed under the supervision of WP 7. These use cases serve as concrete inputs for the future development <b>of</b> <b>OICS.</b> Detailed descriptions about this task are presented in Section 7.

In the project experts from communication studies and linguistics focus on interface and help feature design with a high communicative usability. One research goal is the examination when to apply specific help features for elder users. Based on another study, carried out earlier in the project, barriers of the OIC use by elderly people are reported. The interactive video tutorial described here was created for the elderly with the aim to support learning and understanding main functions <b>of</b> <b>OICs</b> and to avoid the reported barriers. This interactive tutorial has been tested with senior experts. The results show that video tutorials seem to be an effective help feature for different groups of elder users. In combination with interactive toolkits the use of tutorials increases the time users need to fulfil tasks with a toolkit but reduces the number of errors. With respect to toolkits the demands of senior experts seem to be different depending on their Internet usage experience (low vs. high) and their usage profile (passive vs. active). Active dynamic users appreciate video tutorials to get an overview over main functions and to understand functions. Concerning toolkits they prefer solutions that allow them to use both the toolkit and the help instructions at the same time. From the findings recommendations for the design of interactive video tutorials on websites were derived...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this Bachelor thesis is „Recognitional {{solidarity}} or dissolidarity of Organization of the Islamic Conference {{in the direction}} of islamic countries: Kosovo example“. The questionable solidarity issue is important in the islamic world because the islamic religion says that solidarity and unity are the most important aspects in taking decisions by government or state. Almost half of the members of OIC do not follow that principle and are not solidary with the new states of the same religion. Kosovo is a good example – the state is not recognised by half <b>of</b> <b>OICs</b> members and it is important to research why this is. Firstly, it is important to describe in what conditions a state has a right for recognision. The islamic law is slightly different form the International law. The first chapter describes the differences and the priorities that have to be accepted by islamic state who wants to be recognised by other islamic states and International community. Secondly there is an assessement which tries to find out if Kosovo has a right for recognition by islamic and International community based on the criterias described in the first chapter. Kosovo have the match with most of the criterias and thus {{it can be said that}} islamic countries are not solidary with each other based on recognition problem. The third part of bachelor thesis describes the reasons why there is no solidarity between OIC members and the new islamic states. The most important reason is connected to the fact that dissolidary OIC’s member states have very good relations with Russia, who is not intrested in recognising Kosovo. So, Russia has huge influence to OIC members that do not recognise Kosovo. There are also other reasons for lack of solidarity within islamic world. For example the distribution of the islamic religion and the problems connected with the minorities in the different OIC’s member states...|$|E

The OICS has been conceived as an infrastructure for sharing educational resources, with sophisticated services for publication, enrichment, search and retrieval. Additionally the OICS provides the services for the management of learning outcome profiles. This deliverable documents the final status of the OICS as with end of January 2011. For the 1 st generation of the OICS, described in D 1. 1, we had concentrated on building an infrastructure for harvesting and aggregating content provided by members of the consortium. We are now able to use this infrastructure as the underlying framework for implementing prototypical interfaces that allow learners and learning facilitators to engage in processes of outcome based learning. This deliverables starts with describing the types of shareable educational resources that the OICS deals with and documents the data models implemented by the OICS: for users and groups, for repositories and collections, for learning content and instructional models, for learning outcomes, for achievement profiles and for learning opportunities. These data models have been defined in cooperation with other ICOPER work packages, mainly 2 and 3. For learning content and instructional models, we chose the LOM standard as base, since it provides the most complete set of attributes for describing educational properties of an object. The main challenge consisted in defining, implementing and validating an application profile (AP), which would allow us to capture information about learning content and instructional models needed in {{the context of}} processes of outcome-oriented education: The main features of the ICOPER LOM AP that extend the base LOM standard allow  to capture the relationships between instructional models;  to distinguish between different types of comments;  to link instructional models to learning outcome definitions;  to define the type of shareable educational resource according to the ICOPER terminology;  and to provide the packaging format of a learning design. Several technical challenges were met during the implementation of the ICOPER LOM AP, e. g. with respect to validating constraints for vocabularies, implementing persistent, stable and resolvable identifiers, and transforming custom formats used by content providers. In order to make the OICS content accessible from those environments where learning processes are implemented (learning management systems, personal learning environments and social networks), we have defined a Middle Layer API following the design principles of a Service Oriented Architecture. We argue how following these principles allowed us to achieve important quality attributes like interoperability, scalability, reliability, configurability and testability. We present a comprehensive, documentation for the Middle Layer API and three alternative bindings that are optimized for specific client requirements. Section 5 is dedicated to a series of Integration Mini Case Studies which together present the main achievements of WP 1 :  inclusion of six different sources for learning outcome definitions totalling 3, 781 distinct resources;  integration of 19 content providers totalling around 80, 000 resources, providing more than 17, 500 documented hours of instructional content;  experimental implementation of the Metadata for Learning Opportunities (MLO) specification and import of course catalogues from two universities;  implementation <b>of</b> <b>OICS</b> related functionality into 14 different client environments jointly covering a complex workflow of outcome-oriented education including the definition of learning outcomes, the authoring of instructional models, the delivery of learning designs through a learning management system and learners‘ management of learning needs, achievements and assessment records.  OICS search functionality has been integrated into the ICOPER project website. It allows searching and retrieving of all types of shareable educational resources and display of a user‘s achieved learning outcomes. The problems solved during the development of the OICS infrastructure, and some results of the end user evaluation of the OICS client applications lead us to formulate a set of recommendations (Section 7) that are grouped with respect to the development life cycle phase they address. We have learnt that the following key factors need to be taken into account during the design of a brokerage infrastructure for educational resources:  maintenance of consistent technical information through a registry service;  development of an interface specification through a managed community process that takes into account the requirements of different client contexts;  definition of an application profile and validation of all ingested resources;  user perception of relevancy, copyright and privacy;  integration of repository services with social networks which increasingly become part of educational processes. For the setup of the infrastructure, end-user evaluation showed that quantity and quality of content are most relevant for users. For a successful deployment of the infrastructure, we recommend the use of testing environments and monitoring services and of a service capable of managing persistent and unique identifiers for resources. The complete OICS infrastructure is made available as Open Source software. Installation instructions are provided on the ICOPER web site. The OICS infrastructure has been successfully transferred into a different context within the German SpITKom project as described in Section 6. 2. ICOPE...|$|E

H 577 P LMS 2016 Yangxv, 185 pages :illustrationsThis {{research}} employs two perspectives (i. e. {{continuous process}} improvement perspective and frontline employee perspective) {{to develop a}} new approach, operational improvement competence (OIC), and explores new, useful, empirically-based insights into the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in improving operational, service recovery and new service development performance. OIC is conceptualized as an operational team's ability to use a process perspective and structured methods to continuously improve operational activities and comprises three operational practices 1) continuous improvement; 2) process management; and 3) structured methods. However, the operational environment of service firms is often more dynamic and challenging than that of manufacturing firms so that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in service operations may be affected by certain characteristics concerning service processes, employee characteristics and contextual factors. To offer useful insights into the challenges <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> adoption in service operations, we conduct three empirical studies as follows: Study 1, guided by the operations management (OM) literature and agency theory, proposes that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in operational performance in service operations is contingent on two factors, namely operations control and process control formality. Specifically, we theorize that operations control enhances the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> by suppressing frontline service employees' discretion in service processes and guiding them to follow proper procedures to perform OIC activities. In addition, when there are high levels of ethical risks, operations control will become particularly important. Study 2 examines the impact <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> on new service development (NSD) performance. Since creative ideas are crucial to NSD and it is common that service firms involve frontline employees in the process of NSD, we argue that frontline employees' creativity enhances NSD performance. In addition, since OIC pertains to making changes and solving problems regularly, we argue that OIC has a positive impact on employee creativity. Furthermore, we draw on the contingency theory to argue that the relationships between OIC, employee creativity, and NSD performance are contingent on team's characteristics and contextual environment. Study 3 argues that OIC leads to improved service recovery performance. However, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in enhancing service recovery performance can be hindered by one common problem in service employees, namely stress. We draw on the role stress theory and the conservation of resources theory to argue that the negative impact of stress can be alleviated by job resources, including organization inducement and psychological resilience. Thus, we propose that frontline employees' stress and two types of job resources (i. e. organization inducement and psychological resilience) can moderate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> in improving service recovery performance. Based on data from 146 frontline teams in the banking industry of China, we empirically test the posited hypotheses of these three studies. The main contribution of this research lies in its consideration on the job characteristics of frontline service employees and use of several relevant theories to ascertain the intricacies between OIC and performance outcomes with respect to operational performance, service recovery performance and NSD performance.

40|$|Although opioids offer potent {{analgesia}} {{for severe}} acute and chronic noncancer pain, adverse gastrointestinal effects potentially undermine their clinical utility. In particular, between 40 % and 95 % of patients develop opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Therefore, {{there is a}} consensus that patients should commence laxatives {{at the start of}} opioid therapy and continue throughout treatment. Nevertheless, laxatives are not routinely coprescribed with opioids. Even when concurrent laxatives are prescribed, approximately half the patients treated for OIC do not achieve the desired improvement. Moreover, laxatives do not target the underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> (opioid binding to the μ-receptors in the enteric system) and as such are not very effective at managing <b>OIC.</b> The failure <b>of</b> lifestyle modification and laxatives to treat adequately many cases <b>of</b> <b>OIC</b> led to the concurrent use of peripherally acting opioid antagonists (such as methylnaltrexone bromide and naloxone) to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events without compromising analgesia.
