40|$|Limited {{access to}} quality feeds and {{reliable}} feed supply are amongst the priority constraints of smallholder pig production in Uganda. Among the feeds given to pigs, sweetpotato (SP), banana and other root tubers residues are common. However, information on farmers’ perceptions and practices {{on the proper}} use of these residues for pig feeding is limited. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing those aspects, as well as to identify opportunities for better use of these residues in the pig-SP systems. A qualitative survey was undertaken in Masaka and Kamuli, two districts of Uganda with high pig population and SP production. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews (KII) were undertaken with 80 small scale pig and SP producers and 24 key informants. Results from this study revealed that the majority of pig farmers in those districts use SP and <b>other</b> RTB <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> as animal feed. During the rainy season, farmers scored high the utilization of SP <b>crop</b> <b>residues,</b> with the latter being the leading contributor to the pig diet especially in the rural area. SP <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> are usually fed to pigs fresh without processing. Among the residues, fresh raw vines represent the largest part fed to pig (70 %), as compared to roots and peels. The way these residues are offered vary, for example in peri-urban areas with easier access to commercial feeds, farmers feed the <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> mixed with concentrates; whereas in rural areas with limited access to commercial feeds, <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> tend to be given without supplementation. However, the full potential of SP and <b>other</b> RTB <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> for pig feeding is not yet fully exploited as farmers accept that a large amount is wasted (37 % in Masaka and 40 % in Kamuli). In Masaka, the proportion of SP <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> utilized at household level mostly for pig feeding was 40 %, while in Kamuli was 52 %. This study demonstrated that there is potential for better use of SP and <b>other</b> RTB <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> as pig feed in the smallholder pig farming systems in Uganda, but the major constraint as pointed out by farmers is the poor access to technologies for preserving these resources.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Residues</b> of {{previous}} <b>crops</b> provide a valuable amount {{of organic matter}} {{that can be used}} either to restore soil fertility or for external use. A better understanding of the impact of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management on the soil-water-plant system is needed in order to manage agricultural land sustainably. This review focuses on soil physical aspects related to <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management, and specifically on the link between soil structure and hydraulic properties and its impact on crop production. Literature. Conservation practices, including <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> retention and non-conventional tillage, can enhance soil health by improving aggregate stability. In this case, water infiltration is facilitated, resulting in an increase in plant water availability. Conservation practices, however, do not systematically lead to higher water availability for the plant. The influence of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management on <b>crop</b> production is still unclear; in some cases, crop production is enhanced by residue retention, but in <b>others</b> <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> can reduce <b>crop</b> yield. Conclusions. In this review we discuss the diverse and contrasting effects of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management on soil physical properties and crop production under a temperate climate. The review highlights the importance of environmental factors such as soil type and local climatic conditions, highlighting the need to perform field studies on <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> management and relate them to specific pedo-climatic contexts...|$|R

A crop rotation study was initiated in 1979 to assess the effects of various crop sequences and nitrogen (N) fertilization for corn on crop yield. The crop rotations are continuous corn for grain and for silage, continuous soybean, several cornsoybean sequences with one to three corn crops for every soybean crop, and corn-cornoats/alfalfa. Alfalfa is undersown with oats and only oats grain is harvested the first year.

40|$|Corn stover, among <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> <b>residues,</b> is {{becoming}} important an energy source, as non food/feed feedstock, especially for biofuels. A {{problem is to}} ensure a secure supply, which is influenced by drought. The further requirement is to eliminate or minimize biomass removal impact on soil fertility and erosion. The objective of the investigation was to assess possibilities for sustainable provision of corn stover as an energy source, considering these issues. The investigation is conducted in the province Vojvodina, an agricultural part of Serbia, for seasons 2011 and 2012. Weather in 2011 was dry and in 2012 extremely dry. Stover samples were divided in the following fractions: the lowest 0. 2 m, stalk + leaves, cobs and husks. Yields and relative yields of these fractions were calculated and thereafter {{used to determine the}} total and usable mass of stover, considering three stover harvest procedures. The on-field remaining mass of stover was used to determine if the prerequisites for conservation soil tillage, i. e. erosion protection, can be achieved. Relative harvestable yields (related to grain yield) for three harvest procedures, and both seasons, were 53, 43, 19 % (2011) and 16 % (2012). The harvestable mass, i. e. stover yield, in 2012 was, compared with 2011, reduced due to unfavorable weather by 31 % for two harvest procedures and even 42 % if only cobs are harvested. The on-field remaining mass of stover was sufficient to achieve conservation tillage and protection from soil erosion. Determination of nutrient removal costs can represent significant problem, and results from this investigation may contribute. The potential of corn stover harvestable yield depends on harvest procedure. When developing novel harvest solutions, it is recommendable that they should minimize the reduction of grain harvest productivity and stover contact with soil. This needs further R&D activities.

Therefore, biodigestion of green manure biomass and beet foliage was tested to generate readily available N and compared with a direct green manure fertilization system. The effluent was applied as fertilizer in field experiments on a sandy soil {{as a tool for}} improving N supply for an organic farming system. Data from the field experiments were used for simulating the amount of net inorganic N equivalents (inorganic N equivalents from effluent plus inorganic N equivalents from pre-crops) in three crop sequences: A) green manure ley, red beets, winter rye; B) harvested ley, red beets, winter rye; and C) harvested ley, spring barley, red beets in which (B) and (C) represented biogas nutrient management systems and (A) a green manure system. When all available effluent from biogas production from 1 ha of grass–clover ley with two or three harvests (2 H-ley or 3 H-ley) and one hectare of beet foliage was used as a fertilizer for red beets (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva Alef) after barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the yield of marketable red beets increased by 5. 7 Mg·ha– 1 (33 %) with effluent from 2 H-ley and beet foliage and 9. 1 Mg·ha– 1 (53 %) with effluent from 3 H-ley and beet foliage compared with red beets grown without effluent fertilization after a green manure ley. When total dry matter production was taken into account, the advantage for the BG systems with 2 H- and 3 H-ley was 15 % and 28 %, respectively. The nitrate concentration in the red beets was not higher with effluent supplied at this level than with green manure as the only N source. The simulated amount of net inorganic N equivalents was 128 kg N for the whole of crop sequence (C) with 1 ha of each crop and where effluent supply to red beets was based on digested biomass in ley and beet tops. The corresponding amount of net inorganic N equivalents for the green manure crop sequence (A), in which no effluent was supplied, was 73 kg N. Unused soil mineral N (0 - to 90 -cm depth) at red beet harvest indicated that the risk of leaching in BG systems was lower than in GrM systems (88, 76, and 61 kg Nmin/ha left after unmanured beets after Gr-M-ley, low manured beets after 3 H-ley and high manured beets after barley, respectively). Effluent fertilization of red beets directly after 2 H- and 3 H-ley gave unexpectedly low yield responses compared with red beets after barley. The reasons {{may be the result of}} nutritional imbalance of other nutrients than N or may be plant pathological in nature.

No single satisfactory control strategy has been found. Detailed information on C. sordidus biology and ecology is needed to explain the population dynamics of this pest {{in order to develop}} a comprehensive package for the small-scale farmer to alleviate the pest problem. Cultural control forms the first line of defence in pest control. For instance, removal of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> after harvest by chopping is a widely recommended cultural strategy for C. sordidus control. However, the actual effect of these practices on the insect's population dynamics is not clear. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of crop sanitation on population dynamics of C. sordidus and its associated damage. Laboratory and field studies on the biology and ecology of this pest on <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were conducted in Uganda. We found that corms are most attractive to the weevils than any <b>other</b> type of <b>crop</b> <b>residues.</b> Oviposition occurred on residues up to 120 days after harvest, but mainly on freshly harvested residues up to 30 days, implying that residues should be left up to a month before destroying them. In the study on survivorship of C. sordidus in <b>crop</b> <b>residues,</b> our results revealed that the pest successfully completes its life cycle within <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and emerging adults from different aged residues are equally fit. As <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> can be a source of C. sordidus infestation to the standing crop, they need to be destroyed. There is a general belief that covering banana stumps after harvest helps reduce weevils in banana farms. However, there was no data available to prove that this practice is useful. Moreover, the real effect of covering stumps remained unknown. Our studies reveal that covering banana stumps after harvest reduces oviposition on them in the wet season, but encourages oviposition in the dry season. Therefore, farmers may cover the stumps in the wet but not in the dry season. Also, our studies suggest that covering all stumps in the wet season may encourage C. sordidus to oviposit on the <b>crop.</b> Therefore, some <b>residues</b> should be left in the inter-mat alleys to attract weevils away from the <b>crop.</b> The <b>residues</b> can then be destroyed after three to four weeks. Removal and chopping <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> in farmers' fields helped to keep C. sordidus populations and damage lower than when the residues were left to accumulate. In comparison, removal of all residues in young closed banana plots reduced C. sordidus populations but increased damage on growing plants and reduced the levels of natural enemies. The implications of these results on the role of crop sanitation in the integrated management of C. sordidus are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Information on the {{long-term}} effect of management practices on soil C and N stocks is lacking. An experiment was conducted from 2004 to 2011 {{in the northern}} Great Plains, USA {{to examine the effects}} of tillage, crop rotation, and cultural practice on annualized <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> (stems + leaves) returned to the soil and grain yield, and soil total C (STC) and total N (STN) stocks at the 0 – 120 cm depth. Tillage practices were no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) and crop rotations were continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CW), spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (W-P), spring wheat-barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) hay-pea (W-B-P), and spring wheat-barley hay-corn (Zea mays L.) -pea (W-B-C-P). Cultural practices were traditional (conventional seed rates and plant spacing, conventional planting date, broadcast N fertilization, and reduced stubble height) and improved (variable seed rates and plant spacing, delayed planting, banded N fertilization, and increased stubble height). <b>Crop</b> <b>residue</b> and grain yield were greater with CW and W-P than W-B-P and grain yield was greater with the traditional than the improved practice. The STC at 10 – 20 and 90 – 120 cm was greater with CW or W-P than <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> rotations in CT and greater with CW than W-B-P in NT. The STN at 20 – 40 cm was greater with W-P than CW and W-B-P in CT. With NT and the improved cultural practice, STN at 0 – 5, 5 – 10, 20 – 40, and 60 – 90 cm was greater with W-P and W-B-C-P than <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> rotations. The STN at 0 – 10 cm correlated with annualized <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> and grain yield (r = 0. 94 – 0. 97, P ≤ 0. 05). Increased <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> returned to the soil increased soil C stock with CW and W-P and N stock with W-P, but removal of aboveground crop biomass for hay decreased stocks with W-B-P. Increased soil N stock had a beneficial effect on crop grain yield...|$|R
40|$|Low soil {{organic matter}} (OM) characterizes most soils of the humid tropics because <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> are not {{returned}} to the field. A two-year (1997 – 1999) field experiment {{was carried out in}} an Ultisol to determine the contribution of <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> application in sustaining yields of maize (Zea mays L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in a crop rotation system. Three management practices were compared, inorganic fertilizer with <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> (T 1), inorganic fertilizer without <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> (T 2) and half dose of inorganic fertilizer with <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> combined with chicken manure (CM) (T 3), in a randomized block design. During five crops cycle of continuous application of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> with inorganic fertilizers or combined with CM, 43 % of the observed maximum yield of the maize was sustained compared to 21 % in plots where <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were removed. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) uptake by the subsequent crops were significantly higher in <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> treatments whereas phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were not signifi- cantly affected by application of <b>crop</b> <b>residues.</b> In the highly weathered soils of the tropics, incorporation of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> appeared to be a beneficial management practice for sustaining crop yields.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994, mature Charolais cross cows in midgestation were allotted to {{duplicate}} 15 acre fields containing corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> or a 2 -to- 1 mixture of corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and berseem clover planted in 3 strips at an allowance of 2. 5 acres/cow for a 140 day wintering season. Similar cows were allotted duplicate drylots. All cows were fed hay as necessary to maintain a body condition score of 5. Cows grazing corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> with or without berseem clover required 2596 pounds less hay per cow than cows maintained in a drylot. There {{was no difference in}} the amounts of hay required by cows grazing corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> alone or with berseem clover. Initial organic matter yield of berseem clover was nearly that of corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and did not decrease as rapidly as corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues.</b> Berseem clover had a higher organic matter digestibility than corn <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> at the initiation of grazing.

40|$|Effects {{of climate}} {{variability}} and change on yields of pearl millet have frequently been evaluated but yield responses to combined changes in crop management and climate {{are not well}} understood. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the combined effects of nutrient fertilization management and climatic variability on yield of pearl millet in the Republic of Niger. Considered fertilization treatments refer to (i) no fertilization and the use of (ii) <b>crop</b> <b>residues,</b> (iii) mineral fertilizer and (iv) a combination of both. A crop simulation model (DSSAT 4. 5) was evaluated by using data from field experiments reported in the literature and applied to estimate pearl millet yields for two historical periods and under projected climate change. Combination of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> and mineral fertilizer resulted in higher pearl millet yields compared to sole application of <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> or fertilizer. Pearl millet yields showed a strong response to mean temperature under all fertilization practices except the combined treatment in which yields showed higher correlation to precipitation. The crop model reproduced reported yields well including the detected sensitivity of crop yields to mean temperature, but underestimated the response of yields to precipitation for the treatments in which <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were applied. The crop model simulated yield declines due to projected climate change by - 11 to - 62 % depending on the scenario and time period. Future crop yields in the combined <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> + fertilizer treatment were still larger than crop yields in the control treatment with baseline climate, underlining the importance of crop management for climate change adaptation. We conclude that nutrient fertilization and <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> yield limiting factors need to be considered when analyzing and assessing the impact of climate variability and change on crop yields...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of no-tillage in the Cerrado (Savanna-like vegetation of Brazil) {{depends on the}} production of sufficient above-ground <b>crop</b> <b>residue,</b> which can be increased by corn-forage intercropping. This study evaluated how above-ground <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> production and yields of soybean and lateseason corn in a soybean-corn rotation were influenced by the following crops {{in the year before}} soybean: corn (Zea mays L.) intercropped with Brachiaria (Urochloa) brizantha cv. Marandu, B. decumbens cv. Basilisk, B. ruziziensis, cv. comum., Panicum maximum cv. Tanzânia, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp]; sole corn, forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (cv. Santa Elisa) ], and ruzi grass. In March 2005, corn and forage species were planted in alternate rows spaced 0. 90 m apart, and sole forage species were planted in rows spaced 0. 45 m apart. In October 2005, the forages were killed with glyphosate and soybean was planted. After the soybean harvest in March 2006, sole late-season corn was planted in the entire experimental area. Corn grain and stover yields were unaffected by intercropping. Above-ground <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> was greater when corn was intercropped with Tanzania grass (10. 7 Mg ha- 1), Marandu (10. 1 Mg ha- 1), and Ruzi Grass (9. 8 Mg ha- 1) than when corn was not intercropped (4. 0 Mg ha- 1). The intercropped treatments increased the percentage of soil surface covered with <b>crop</b> <b>residue.</b> Soybean and corn grain yields were higher after sole ruzi grass and intercropped ruzi grass than after <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b> The intercropping corn with Brachiaria spp. and corn with Panicum spp. increases above-ground <b>crop</b> <b>residue</b> production and maintains nutrients in the soil without reducing late-season corn yield and the viability of no-till in the midwestern region of Brazil. 201...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the humid-forest, forest-savanna, and Guinea savanna zones of West Africa from 1993 to 1999 to examine the effect of managing <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> from cereal-legume <b>cropping</b> systems for mulch and fodder for sheeIncreasing the proportion of total <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> produced from a unit area of land and used as mulch increased maize grain yield, soil organic carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus. The extra increases obtained when more than half the <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> were applied as mulch were relatively small, however, suggesting that 25 - 50 % of the <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> could be removed as feed without any detrimental effect. When any <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> rejected by sheep were mixed with livestock urine and faeces and returned to the respective fields from where the <b>crop</b> <b>residues</b> had been removed, subsequent grain yield and soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and available phosphorus increased.
