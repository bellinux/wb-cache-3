40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> guidance in Hong Kong secondary schools by means of a comprehensive research into the roles <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> teachers. It inquires into the expectations and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> teachers themselves and the key members of their role set - the principal, students and parents of the school. A proposed 'Model <b>of</b> <b>Careers</b> Teachers' Roles' derived from the academic literature in the context of Hong Kong is also examined through a number of key questions. This study explores the importance of future policy planning and development <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> guidance to facilitate the school to work transition <b>of</b> students. <b>Careers</b> teachers' roles are presented as multifaceted and reliant on sound knowledge, skills and theories from continued professional development. In this study, the methodological tools are a survey and three case studies. The breadth of evidence is provided by 82 valid replies to the questionnaire survey, and the depth of the grounds is derived from three case studies comprising interviews, documentary analysis and observation. Then, the roles <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> teachers in Hong Kong secondary schools are analysed, and the various aspects of their roles and duties are identified. Factors that help and hinder the provision <b>of</b> <b>careers</b> guidance are also examined. Finally, a 'Comprehensive Counselling and Guidance Programme' is proposed as a guideline for careers teachers to enhance their performance of duties and to improve their services for their students at all levels in their schools...|$|R

5|$|After the Pearl Harbor attack, Taylor was {{assigned}} to the 44th Fighter Squadron, and went to the South Pacific at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. He was able to record two additional aerial kills: the first on January 27 and the other on December 7, 1943, two years after Pearl Harbor. This brought his total number <b>of</b> <b>career</b> kills to six, making him a flying ace. Officially however, Taylor is still only credited with two aerial victories on December 7, 1941 and one on January 27, 1943. At Guadalcanal, he was injured during an air raid and was sent back to the United States in 1943. In the U.S., he trained pilots in preparation of combat in Europe and was then assigned to the 12th Pursuit Squadron. At the end of World War II, Taylor had reached the rank of major and went to the Philippines to command a squadron that used the first United States Air Force combat jets, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star.|$|E

5|$|After {{twenty years}} <b>of</b> <b>career</b> struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk {{had become a}} jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} in Australia {{and grew up in}} England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he {{established}} a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change <b>of</b> <b>career</b> allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he {{was on the verge of}} the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change <b>of</b> <b>career,</b> and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E

The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change <b>of</b> <b>career</b> (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E
