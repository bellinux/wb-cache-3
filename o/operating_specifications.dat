25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, {{with even more}} engines {{requiring}} urgent maintenance and repairs, orders were placed for an additional ten P class locomotives which would be improved through modifications to the boilers, bogies, headlights and valve gear. These new locomotives were constructed at the Midland Railway Workshops. The boilers featured an increase in pressure from 160 to 175psi, which provided more power, and the bogies were constructed in cast steel. These improved locomotives were delivered to the same <b>operating</b> <b>specifications</b> as the original P class, with the same weight distribution and boiler pressure limited to 160 psi, though improvements to the track and bridges on the Eastern Goldfields Railway in 1940 meant {{that they could be}} altered to use their designed power through the increasing of the axle load from 12.8 to 14.2 tons and the resetting of the boiler-top safety valves to 175 psi. The result was a 9% increase in tractive effort with the same economical running of the P class.|$|E

50|$|Solid-state drives (SSD) are a newer form of {{data storage}} which is gaining in popularity. The more common and {{traditional}} {{hard disk drive}} (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs {{in favor of the}} advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to <b>operating</b> <b>specifications.</b> An SSD drive can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD drive. For an SSD drive, files almost open instantly. This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time. SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order load items from the game such as levels and textures. However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.|$|E
