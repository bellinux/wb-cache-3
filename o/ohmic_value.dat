The proposed power divider is realized using two cascaded sections of dual-band transformers based on coupled microstrip lines.

40|$|NiCr {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacture}} of thin metal film resistors (TFR) in the value range 10 Ω to 1 MΩ because of its relatively large resistivity, low temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) and excellent stability of resistance. However the demand for TFR’s with <b>ohmic</b> <b>values</b> of less than 10 Ω has significantly increased in recent years due to the rising demand for low-loss current sensing in many electronic products. Consequently this trend has highlighted a number of problems associated with the manufacture of lower resistance NiCr films, primarily increased film thickness and hence increase in deposition time. This paper investigates the electrical properties of AlCu as a replacement for NiCr in this lower resistance range. Films of NiCr and compositions of AlCu were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering in Ar. After deposition the films were annealed in both air and N 2 atmospheres at a range of temperatures. A direct comparison of electrical characteristics of the two film systems was then performed. Results reveal that an increase in Al content produces a decrease in TCR and gives an improvement in resistance stability.

40|$|Back in 1964, the {{batteries}} used in critical applications were looked after by skilled technicians, and valve-regulated lead-acid battery (VRLA) technology {{was but a}} gleam in the developer’s eye. Battery service was, {{in the majority of}} cases, an in-house task. Routine visual inspection, the scheduled collection of voltage and specific gravity readings, coupled with the experience of the technicians and their local knowledge, was what made it all work. With the growth of computers and the associated uninterruptible power systems (UPS), VRLA batteries started to become the dominant technology, in part because they were marketed as maintenance free. The term ‘maintenance free ” referred to the fact that you didn’t need to add water, but the problem was that you couldn’t measure the specific gravity and, since the cases were opaque, you couldn’t see the condition of the plates either. Some 18 years ago, the first products were developed to measure the internal <b>ohmic</b> <b>value</b> of a battery cell and to use this value as a guide to the battery's condition.

For the purpose of assessing the battery internal <b>ohmic</b> <b>value,</b> some battery monitoring manufacturers inject AC signals in to the battery strings, while others periodically apply a load pulse. Unfortunately, those signals are not always welcomed by the battery user or battery manufacturer. The authors will present a passive method to measure and pinpoint a suspicious cell and extract battery performance information without injecting any signals to the battery by using the normally unwelcomed signals produced by charger/UPS equipment. Any AC power converter using the battery for the backup power source does inversely introduce the AC signals (often referred as the ripple and noises) across the DC link. The amplitude and frequency of these signals vary with UPS architecture. The authors will classify the source and properties of such signals in standby, on-line, 12 -step, and PWM power conversion, with isolated and nonisolated battery placement. The information should show performance down to individual cells without injecting any external signals to the battery link. The possibility of using the existing signals, in the form of ripple or white noise, will be discussed; however, AC signals across a battery are usually in low or very low amplitude; therefore a special noise elimination technique must be applied. The concept of an instrument capable of measuring the signal below noise level, the technical obstacles, and results of the online test will be presented and discussed in detail...|$|E

Ohm's law depicts the linear current response I to the applied voltage V across a length of resistor. The resistance, as inverse slope of current-voltage (I-V) graph, is constant and is extensively used in the published literature. However, the linear response transforms to a sublinear response with current eventually saturating to a constant value I,m. Nonohmic behaviour is distinctly visible when applied voltage V is larger than the critical voltage v:e =V,L / e= (V> v,), V, is the thermal voltage with value 0. 0259 V at room temperature and t ow(typically 100 urn) is the mean free path (mfp) in a nanoscale (L < 1000 nm) device. The breakdown of Ohm's law affects heavily the flow of transporting carrier in a nanoscale device. The surge in direct resistance R~V/I and incremental FdV/dI changes the time constants, power consumption, voltage and current division laws. The transient RC switching delay in micro/nano-scale circuit is strongly affected by the surge in the resistance arising out of sub-linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics.

The major phenomena are discussed and explanations have been offered for the observed effects with various types of illumination. Phenomena observed have been compared {{with the results of}} other workers. One type of instability was initiated by applying high voltage pulses to CdS specimens in complete darkness. It is observed from the field measurements that the period of oscillation is equal to the transit time of the acoustic wave from the position of high field region to the anode end of the specimen and not related to the wave transit time between electrodes. High frequency non-sinusodial electrical oscillations were observed in uniformly illuminated specimens. These were attributed to the effect of longitudinal potential gradients which were found when the electric field was measured under oscillatory conditions. Continuous acousto-electric current oscillations were observed in a specimen by shading a length near to the anode end. Extremely high fields were detected in the high resistivity region so formed when amplification occurred. Obscuring a narrow strip perpendicular to the length of the sample and applying a high voltage pulse resulted in current oscillations and two step saturation of the current. A number of oscillatory modes were often found in a specimen, depending on the position of the shielded strip on the specimen. Extremely high electricfields were observed near the position of the obscured strip of the specimen. In two-step current saturation phenomena the changes in current pulses were recorded. Low frequency current oscillations were observed after the current had fallen to a final steady value.

40|$|Radiation {{detectors}} {{are used}} in a large variety of fields such as medicine, security, defense, geophysics, industry and physics. They {{have been developed to}} detect the energy or position of radiation or charge particles. In Chapter 1 several X-ray detectors were introduced briefly. In gas filled X-ray detectors, incoming photons ionize inert gas and create electron and ions which can be collected at a thin wire anode inside of the chamber. The advantage of this type of detector is the possibility to amplify the signal or charge, hence a high signal to noise ratio. However, they suffer from low efficiency for X-ray detection due to low density of the filled gas. In scintillation detectors, X-ray photons collide with the scintillator and create UV or visible light which can be converted into an electrical signal by a photodiode. The main disadvantage of scintillation detectors is their poor energy resolution due to a large amount of loss, and the relatively high ionization energy, i. e. 20 - 500 eV. In semiconductor detectors, electron and hole pairs (EHPs) can be generated at much lower energies than gas filled detectors. The possibility to measure both position and energy of incoming radiation accurately is a unique property for semiconductor detectors. However, they do not have any intrinsic signal gain, {{as is the case in}} gas filled detectors. Therefore an integrated or external amplifier is required for this type of detector. When selecting semiconductor materials, higher density, a higher atomic number for better absorption efficiency, lower bandgap for better resolution, higher mobility for fast detection beside lower leakage current, and a thicker substrate should be considered. Among different semiconductor materials, silicon is an interesting material for X-ray detectors because of the availability of fabrication process technology, lower cost and possibility to integrate advanced electronic circuits and further signal processing. PIN photodiodes made in a high resistivity silicon substrate are the simplest, cheapest, commercially available type of X-ray detectors where the full thickness of silicon is depleted by reverse bias to extract the generated EHPs with radiation. However, PIN detectors have a large anode area which makes the output capacitance so large that higher noise level in the output is the result. In Si(Li) and Ge(Li) detectors, crystals of silicon or germanium are used with thicknesses in the range of a few mm to cm. To obtain intrinsic material (concentration levels as low as 109 cm- 3) for complete thickness, a Li drifting process is used where Li acts as a donor to compensate acceptor ions. The typical biasing voltage is 500 V to 4000 V. In order to prevent redistribution of the Li atoms, the detector has to be kept at a low temperature with liquid nitrogen, which is the main disadvantage for this type of detector. Silicon strip detectors offer 2 D position sensitive detection. They are similar to PIN diodes, but the p+ region is divided into many strips on the front side to collect the holes, and the n+ region is divided into many n+ strips on the backside to collect the electrons. In silicon pixel detectors (SPDs) only one side of p+n is patterned and every pixel has its own readout electronics attached to the pixel by solder bumping. In p-n CCDs the drift function is carried out by reverse and forward biases of p-n junctions in periodic cycles by external pulses acting as series of shift registers drifting the electrons toward the anode. Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are detectors with an extremely small anode and low output capacitance, thus less noise and high energy resolution. In a circular configuration the p+ drift rings create an electric field parallel to the surface to collect the electrons in the small anode region. Independent of the active area of the detector, a typical output capacitance of an SDD is in the range of 60 fF. On-chip electronic devices are placed on the front side to amplify the signal. In the Silicon Drift Detector Droplet (SD³) the anode and integrated transistor are moved to the margin of the structure where they can be shielded from direct radiation by a proper collimator. This has a significant effect on the low energy background in the SDD. With the SD³ the peak/background ratio is increased from 3000 to 5000. Multichannel SDDs consist of many single SDDs with individual readout but a common entrance window, guard ring and supply voltage where the sensitive area is very big, up to few cm 2, without losing the energy resolution and count rate capability of the single SDD. Finally in 3 D detectors implanted electrodes of conventional SDD are replaced with a 3 D array of p+ and n+ electrodes inside the silicon. In 3 D detectors collection distances and times are about one order of magnitude less than planar strips and pixel detectors, and the depletion voltage is about two orders of magnitude lower. However, the fabrication process is complex and expensive. In Chapter 2 the properties of the boron layer were described in detail. A boron layer is deposited in an ASM Epsilon reactor using Diborane (B 2 H 6) and Hydrogen as a dopant gas and carrier gas at temperatures ranging from 500 oC to 700 oC. The typical thickness of the boron layer deposited at 700 oC for a 7 min deposition time is equal to a 2 - 3 nm uniform layer. Deposition at lower temperatures results in a non-uniform boron layer which is confirmed by TEM analysis. Fabricated PureB diodes behave like a conventional deep p+-n junction with near ideal ideality factors lower than ? 1. 02, and low saturation current. Resistors are key elements in integrated circuits and can be made with a p-n junction or by poly silicon deposition. However, drawbacks for these two technologies are bias dependence, high parasitic capacitance for high <b>Ohmic</b> <b>values</b> in junction made resistors, and large variation and process dependency for poly-made resistors. The typical sheet resistance value of the deposited boron layer is in the 100 k?/? range which can be changed by deposition time, temperature and annealing. In this thesis, the photodiodes were fabricated on high-resistivity Si (HRS) wafers, n-type phosphorous-doped to 2 - 10 k?-cm. The resistors were also placed directly in the HRS so that associated depletion layers were tens of microns wide even at 0 V biasing. Thus the voltage dependence of the resistance value is negligible. The fabrication process consisted of oxidation followed by etching, boron layer deposition and finally metallization. To remove Al from the top of the boron layer, a combination of dry etching and short wet etching in diluted HF was used. The sheet resistance values extracted from measurement of the ring structures are 2. 5 × 104 ?/? for a 7 min 700 oC deposition and 3. 8 × 105 ?/? for a 20 min 500 oC deposition. Fabricated resistors show high linearity in voltage ranges between 10 V and 100 V and are stable in temperature ranges from 15 °C to 95 °C. The 500 oC resistors have a TCR (temperature coefficient of the resistor) less than 200 ppm/oC up to a measurement temperature of 70 oC, then increasing to around 1000 ppm/oC at 95 oC. The TCR of the 700 oC sample had an almost constant value of less than 400 ppm/oC over the whole measurement temperature range. The measured leakage current was less than 1 nA/cm 2 at 10 V reverse bias over all dies of the 100 mm wafer. The measured resistor tolerance was in the range of 1 % to 5 % for both k? and M? resistors. Since Pure Al can short the shallow junctions to bulk especially when the boron layer is deposited at lower temperatures (non-uniform boron layer) or when there is a defect on the substrate, an alloy of AlSi (1 % Si) is used. However, removing AlSi with a wet process is not compatible with the boron layer process. Therefore it is better to add a diffusion barrier layer between the Al and boron layer. Among different studied diffusion barrier layers such as Ti, TiN, AlN and ZrN, only ZrN showed better process compatibility and no influence on the electrical performance of the detectors. Optical and SEM inspections show a defect-free detector surface when using 10 nm ZrN between the Al and boron layer for both the 700 oC and 500 oC deposited layers. As an alternative, a lift-off process was developed to prevent any Al residuals on the boron layer. After PureB layer deposition at 700 oC or 500 oC, a negative photoresist (AZ®nLOF) was applied and patterned followed by 400 nm-thick Al layer deposition by evaporation. Then the resist was stripped in acetone or a NMP solution in an ultrasonic bath. For both PureB layers deposited at 700 oC or 500 oC, the lift-off process was successfully performed. However, the limitation of Al thickness and the deposition method (evaporation) can be a challenge for some applications. In Chapter 3 the working principle of SDDs was reviewed. They have a higher count rate and better energy resolution with respect to other X-ray detectors. In order to have a successful working detector, different aspects of SDDs must be selected, designed and simulated carefully. The starting material for SDDs is high-Ohmic silicon wafers due to a better carrier lifetime (in the order of milliseconds) and lower required voltage for full depletion. To obtain better wafer uniformity typically wafers are made with the Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) method where uniformity of the phosphorus doping is achieved by exposing an ingot of high-purity silicon to a uniform flux of thermal neutrons. For detection of higher energies, thicker wafers should be used. Furthermore, a silicon substrate has a higher charge collection efficiency (CCE) of soft X-rays (below 200 nm wavelengths) and has a lower surface leakage current compared to the orientation. The entrance window of the detector determines the lowest energy the detector can detect. In SDDs the entrance window is kept in a vacuum by using Beryllium or polymer windows. Those|$|R
