5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> the {{surrounding}} buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office {{in front of}} it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E

5|$|On 28 March 1913, a train {{leaving for}} High Wycombe {{collided}} with another arriving from Leicester, killing one passenger and injuring 23 {{people on the}} incoming train.

5|$|On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s {{attacked}} fortified {{targets in}} Hamburg. The target was <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> cloud so radar guidance {{was used to}} launch the bombs.

5|$|The {{comparatively}} old {{globular cluster}} NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200light-years distant and somewhat <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900light-years away from Earth and 23,000light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a bright field of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E

When the buffalo hunting declined, Garrett left Texas and rode to the New Mexico Territory.|$|R
5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but {{according}} to George it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
50|$|Furrina, also spelled Furina, was {{an ancient}} Roman goddess whose {{function}} had become <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> {{the time of}} Varro. Her cult dated to the earliest period of Roman religious history, since {{she was one of}} the fifteen deities who had their own flamen, the Furrinalis, one of the flamines minores. There is some evidence that Furrina was associated with water.|$|R

The population numbered 1,571,243 in 1897, and of that number 707,132 were women and 286,369 were urban.|$|R
5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
