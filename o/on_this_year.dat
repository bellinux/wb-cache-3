500|$|Sahure {{is known}} to have been succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai, who was {{believed}} to be his brother until 2005. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> a relief originally adorning the causeway of Sahure's pyramid and showing Sahure seated in front of two of his sons, Ranefer and Netjerirenre, was discovered by the Egyptologists Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady. Next to Ranefer's name the text [...] "Neferirkare Kakai king of Upper and Lower Egypt" [...] had been added, indicating that Ranefer was Sahure's son and assumed the throne under the name [...] "Neferirkare Kakai" [...] at the death of his father. Since both Ranefer and Netjerirenre are given the titles of [...] "King's eldest son", Verner and El-Awady speculate that they may have been twins and that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name [...] "Shepseskare". The same relief further depicts queen Meretnebty, who was thus most likely Sahure's consort and the mother of Ranefer (Neferirkare Kakai) and Netjerirenre. Three more sons, Horemsaf, Khakare and Nebankhre are shown on reliefs from Sahure's mortuary temple, but the identity of their mother is unknown.|$|E

Here he competed in three fights, he defeated two adversaries by unanimous decision, these were: Kabil Lahsen of Morocco with score of 16–4 and Nariman Atayev of Uzbekistan with a score of 28–15.

Here <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> {{were the}} ships ready {{of which we}} [...] ere spake, and {{there were so many}} of them as never ere (so [...] far as books tell us) were made among English kin in no [...] king's day. And man brought them all {{together}} to Sandwich, [...] and there should they lie, and hold this earth against all [...] outlanders [foreigners'] hosts. But we had not yet the luck [...] nor the worship [valour] that the ship-fyrd should be of [...] any good to this land, no more than it oft was afore. Then [...] befel it at this ilk time or a little ere, that Brihtric, [...] Eadric's brother the ealdorman's, forwrayed [accused] [...] Wulfnoth child to the king: and he went out and drew unto [...] him twenty ships, and there harried everywhere by the south [...] shore, and wrought all evil. Then quoth man to the ship-fyrd [...] that man might easily take them, if man were about it. Then [...] took Brihtric to himself eighty ships and thought that he [...] should work himself great fame if he should get Wulfnoth, [...] quick or dead. But as they were thitherward, there came such [...] a wind against them such as no man ere minded [remembered], [...] and it all to-beat and to-brake the ships, and warped them [...] on land: and soon came Wulfnoth and for-burned the ships. [...] When this was couth [known] to the other ships where the [...] king was, how the others fared, then was it as though it [...] were all redeless, and the king fared him home, and the [...] ealdormen, and the high witan, and forlet the ships thus [...] lightly. And the folk that were on the ships brought them [...] round eft to Lunden, and let all the people's toil thus [...] lightly go for nought: and the victory that all English kin [...] hoped for was no better. There this ship-fyrd was thus [...] ended; then came, soon after Lammas, the huge foreign host, [...] that we hight Thurkill's host, to Sandwich, and soon wended [...] their way to Canterbury, and would quickly have won the burg [...] if they had not rather yearned for peace of them. And all [...] the East Kentings made peace with the host, and gave it [...] three thousand pound. And the host there, soon after that, [...] wended till it came to Wightland, and there everywhere in [...] Suth-Sex, and on Hamtunshire, and eke on Berkshire harried [...] and burnt, as their wont is. Then bade the king call out all [...] the people, that men should hold against them on every half [...] [side]: but none the less, look! they fared where they [...] willed. Then one time had the king foregone before them with [...] all the fyrd as they were going to their ships, and all the [...] folk was ready to fight them. But it was let, through Eadric [...] ealdorman, as it ever yet was. Then, after St. Martin's [...] mass, they fared eft again into Kent, and took them a winter [...] seat on Thames, and victualled themselves from East-Sex and [...] from the shires that there next were, on the twain halves [...] of Thames. And oft they fought against the burg of Lunden, [...] but praise be to God, it yet stands sound, and they ever [...] there fared evilly. And there after mid-winter they took [...] their way up, out through Chiltern, and so to Oxenaford [...] [Oxford], and for-burnt the burg, and took their way on to [...] the twa halves of Thames to shipward. There man warned them [...] that there was fyrd gathered at Lunden against them; then [...] wended they over at Stane [Staines]. And thus fared they all [...] the winter, and that Lent were in Kent and bettered [...] [repaired] their ships.|$|E
