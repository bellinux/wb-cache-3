He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> journey and making {{you feel that the}} weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

[...] "He frequently wrote in language that echoed Henry Morton Stanley's African diary. ‘Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business you never heard of can own the history <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> affairs.’" [...] He wanted to encourage and provoke youngsters to explore the cyberspace through his writing.|$|E
