According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels.

500|$|Jerome {{otherwise}} had a {{dim view of}} the Arabs. His prejudices {{were those}} of a native Roman. Born in Strido (in modern Croatia or Slovenia), near Aquileia, and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: [...] "Ciceronianus es, non Christianus", [...] "you are a Ciceronian, not a Christian". In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of Chalcis, he tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> he had when he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the [...] "barbarous" [...] languages of the natives (that is, Syriac and Arabic). From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.|$|E

500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] ("My all in all, my eternal good"), {{again with}} strings, is a dance-like {{movement}} in free da capo form, A B A'. The unusually long text, of four lines for the A section and {{two for the}} B section, results in Bach's solution to repeat {{the end of the}} first line (my eternal good) after all text of A, and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A', thus ending A and A' the same way. In this modified repeat, the voice holds a long note on the word [...] ("peace"), after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the passepied character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: [...] "Bach's expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited", and summarises: [...] "The 3/8 time signature, symmetrical phrasing and rapid string skirls combine to create a sense of a dance of abandonment." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{his first}} ten years, [...] "Johnny" [...] McCain (the {{nickname}} {{he was given}} {{as part of a}} family tradition of distinguishing the generations) [...] was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister Sandy (born 1934) and younger brother Joe (born 1942), followed his father to New London, Connecticut, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean. Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation, but McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern. [...] McCain attended whatever naval base school was available, often to the detriment of his education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic. [...] After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, his father was absent for long stretches. [...] His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites. He later wrote, [...] "She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of living." [...] A Republican, she also made sure that he followed current events, although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's military career.|$|E

Kelly made his {{recording}} debut aged 16, playing on saxophonist Hal Singer's 1948 [...] "Cornbread", which became a Billboard R chart-topping hit. In the following year, Kelly recorded with vocalist Babs Gonzales; these tracks included his first recorded solos. Other R bands that Kelly played with included those led by Hot Lips Page (1948 or earlier), Eddie [...] "Cleanhead" [...] Vinson (1949), and Eddie [...] "Lockjaw" [...] Davis (1950). Material from sessions on July 25 and August 1, 1951 formed Piano Interpretations, a trio album that was Kelly's recording debut as leader, released by Blue Note Records later that year. Critic Scott Yanow indicates that, {{at this stage of}} his career, Kelly's main influence was Bud Powell, but that his playing [...] "displayed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of Teddy Wilson's style along with his own chord voicings". Kelly became better known after joining vocalist Dinah Washington's band in 1951. After this, he played in bands led by Lester Young in the spring of 1952, and Dizzy Gillespie, recording with the latter later in 1952. In September of that year, just as Kelly was beginning to build a reputation, he was drafted into the army.|$|E
500|$|The general {{impact of}} Olney Hymns was {{immediate}} {{and it became}} a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in Olney Hymns are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> he found in his faith. As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in first person, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America considers [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective. Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work ("Amazing Grace" [...] was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write. Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to [...] "Amazing Grace", an [...] "unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I was the guy standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Joy</b> Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E
