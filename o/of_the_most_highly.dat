5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus far been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In 1843 he {{travelled}} to Italy {{where he}} remained for four years. On {{his return to}} London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy works.

In 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of his term, Crittenden was {{concerned}} with quelling the violence in Kansas Territory. An opponent of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the Missouri Compromise unless the North agreed to substitute popular sovereignty for the exclusion of slavery north of the 36°30' line. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by Robert Toombs to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it as a step to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden's influence after his actions on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden's endorsement of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois senatorial election in 1858.|$|E
5|$|Most aquatic stereospondyls have {{flattened}} heads. When feeding, {{they probably}} opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws. The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> adapted. Gerrothorax {{is thought to have}} lifted its skull to around 50° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle. Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>highly</b> decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E
