He then offered to distribute them to the press. Veerappan agreed knowing that Anandan was then {{a member of the}} South Indian Film Journalists Association. After a few days, stills of the film were published in many magazines. Ramachandran was impressed with Anandan's work and, at Veerappan's suggestion, hired him as the film's public relations officer (PRO). This was Anandan's debut film as a PRO; however, his name does not appear in the opening credits.|$|E

2500|$|The Resolute desk is a large, nineteenth-century partners' desk used {{by seven}} {{presidents of the}} United States in the White House Oval Office as the Oval <b>Office</b> <b>desk.</b> It {{was a gift from}} Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B.

Kennedy, to bring the Resolute desk into the Oval Office for the first time.|$|E

The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin—although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.

2500|$|Still, {{with the}} {{business}} still in the black, Alexander did find time to start a romantic relationship with Eve Elder, a 33-year-old insurance claims agent, around 1995. As the relationship wore on, however, Elder would later see some odd signs of the potentially deadly violent streak in Alexander, especially when commenting about the inspectors. In what had {{started out as a}} joke, the couple concocted a series of short stories; one, titled [...] "Sausage Sniffers Found Sauced", painted a description of the inspectors drowning in vats of 'secret sauce'. Soon, the tone of Alexander's words would take on a much darker tone. [...] As another former girlfriend, Charlotte Knapp, 38, who had been seeing Alexander off and on up until the time of the murders, would later testify during the murder trial, Alexander frequently used profanities to describe the inspectors and would at times have some choice words ready for them, or for anyone else whom he deemed as [...] "trespassers" [...] that came upon his factory.

He left his leather briefcase against the pedestrian walkway railing mid-span of the Golden Gate Bridge. His <b>office</b> <b>desk</b> contained several suicide notes but his death was not confirmed until his body was found nearly six weeks later, seven miles out to sea, near Pillar Point Harbor, about 25 miles south of the bridge from which he jumped. The coroner described his body as [...] "intact but unrecognisable". Many of his friends and colleagues were deeply shocked by his death but his close friends were not surprised by his cinematic ending. His eulogist, Jenni Olson, summed it up: [...] "Of course, given his personality, I just thought, 'Oh, how Mark' that it would be so spectacular. He doesn't do anything in a small way." [...] A memorial service was held at the Castro Theatre on 26 February 1995, and the 19th San Francisco Festival was dedicated to Finch's memory. A special fund was established in his name [...] "to help support the work of emerging queer filmmakers". Ten years after his death Olson made a film, The Joy of Life, of which the second half addresses his suicide and the part played in it by the Golden Gate Bridge.|$|E

60|$|Books {{open with}} torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay about grimy and black, {{looking as if}} they had never been opened. Account books. In those books he had {{intended}} to keep day by day a record of his rising fortunes. Long time ago. A very long time. For many years there has been no record to keep on the blue and red ruled pages! In {{the middle of the room}} the big <b>office</b> <b>desk,</b> with one of its legs broken, careened over like the hull of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had fallen out, disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt. The revolving office chair stood in its place, but he found the pivot set fast when he tried to turn it. No matter. He desisted, and his eyes wandered slowly from object to object. All those things had cost a lot of money at the time. The desk, the paper, the torn books, and the broken shelves, all under a thick coat of dust. The very dust and bones of a dead and gone business. He looked at all these things, all that was left after so many years of work, of strife, of weariness, of discouragement, conquered so many times. And all for what? He stood thinking mournfully of his past life till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child speaking amongst all this wreck, ruin, and waste. He started with a great fear in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in the papers scattered on the floor, broke the chair into bits, splintered the drawers by banging them against the desk, and made a big heap of all that rubbish in one corner of the room.|$|E
60|$|Great George Street, Westminster, is {{the address}} of Doyle and Broadbent, civil engineers. On the {{threshold}} one reads that the firm consists of Mr Lawrence Doyle and Mr Thomas Broadbent, and that their rooms are on the first floor. Most of their rooms are private; for the partners, being bachelors and bosom friends, live there; and the door marked Private, next the clerks' office, is their domestic sitting room {{as well as their}} reception room for clients. Let me describe it briefly {{from the point of view}} of a sparrow on the window sill. The outer door is in the opposite wall, close to the right hand corner. Between this door and the left hand corner is a hatstand and a table consisting of large drawing boards on trestles, with plans, rolls of tracing paper, mathematical instruments and other draughtsman's accessories on it. In the left hand wall is the fireplace, and the door of an inner room between the fireplace and our observant sparrow. Against the right hand wall is a filing cabinet, with a cupboard on it, and, nearer, a tall <b>office</b> <b>desk</b> and stool for one person. In the middle of the room a large double writing table is set across, with a chair at each end for the two partners. It is a room which no woman would tolerate, smelling of tobacco, and much in need of repapering, repainting, and recarpeting; but this is the effect of bachelor untidiness and indifference, not want of means; for nothing that Doyle and Broadbent themselves have purchased is cheap; nor is anything they want lacking. On the walls hang a large map of South America, a pictorial advertisement of a steamship company, an impressive portrait of Gladstone, and several caricatures of Mr Balfour as a rabbit and Mr Chamberlain as a fox by Francis Carruthers Gould.|$|E
