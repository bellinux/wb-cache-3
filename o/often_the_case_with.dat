Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car.

5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> herpes viruses.

5|$|As was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Celtic churches {{from this}} period, {{the church was}} {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It has been said that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E

5|$|As is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{patients}} {{present with}} progressive pain, often long standing and/or bony swelling and restricted {{range of movement}} in affected limb 3,12.

50|$|As has <b>often</b> been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> sole female {{members of}} bands, Cindy Kent (like Judith Durham of the Seekers) {{attracted}} her own share of attention. No doubt {{this was due}} in part to her fine singing voice, photogenic good looks, and tendency to wear mini-skirts. But her public espousal of Christianity brought her into contact with the singer Cliff Richard, a prominent born again Christian, and they both contributed to various events with a Christian theme.|$|R
5000|$|The {{libretto}} is {{not always}} written before the music. Some composers, such as Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Serov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Puccini and Mascagni wrote passages of music without text and subsequently had the librettist add words to the vocal melody lines. (This has <b>often</b> been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> American popular song and musicals in the 20th century, as with Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's collaboration, although with the later team of Rodgers and Hammerstein the lyrics were generally written first.) ...|$|R
25|$|As is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{policies}} {{intended to}} forge or bolster national identity in a state, Magyarization was perceived by {{other ethnic groups}} such as the Romanians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Croats, Serbs, etc., as aggression or active discrimination, especially where they formed the majority of the population.|$|E
25|$|Maturity/redemption date: Final {{payment date}} of a loan or other {{financial}} instrument, {{at which point}} the principal (and all remaining interest) is due to be paid.

25|$|According to Ward and Ogden's {{qualitative}} {{study on the}} experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (<b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).|$|E

50|$|Advantageously, monocular {{occlusion}} {{is applied}} before {{the test for}} at least 30 minutes.

30|$|As <b>often</b> is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{real world}} data, the data {{collected}} was somewhat problematic, with missing, duplicated or corrupted entries.

The machine learning methods we apply either expect or are more effective if the data attributes all have the same scale. The two scaling methods we applied on our data were normalization and standardization.|$|R
