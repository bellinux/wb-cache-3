5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp.|$|E

5|$|The corona is the {{extended}} {{atmosphere of the}} Sun, which has a volume {{much larger than the}} volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity {{due to its}} Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{higher pressure}} areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity {{adds to the}} forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E

5|$|While at peak intensity, Ernest {{was a small}} cyclone with gales {{extending}} 130km (80mi) <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> well-defined eye. After maintaining peak winds {{for about}} 12hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast. On January23, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo, with winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January23, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking it until the storm dissipated on January25 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The fuzziness {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E

The road goes on past the grounds of Chiswick House as Burlington Lane, and then becomes Great Chertsey Road, passing Chiswick School. It then crosses the Thames on Chiswick Bridge.|$|R
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper {{portion of the}} belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E
