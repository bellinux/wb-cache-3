2500|$|Emanuel wrote Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet (1996) for the Hastings Center Report. In {{this article}} Emanuel {{questioned}} whether a defect in <b>our</b> <b>medical</b> ethics causes {{the failure of}} the US to enact universal health care coverage. The macro level of the issue is the proportion of total gross national product allotted to health care, the micro level is which individual patient will receive specific forms of health care, e.g., [...] "whether Mrs. White should receive this available liver for transplantation." [...] In between are the basic or essential health care services that should be provided to each citizen. The end-stage renal disease program {{is an example of a}} service that increases the total cost of health care, and reduces the amount that can be spent on basic or essential health care.|$|E

"While our {{teachers}} were resorting to centers {{of learning in}} increasing numbers, followed to no small degree by student graduates and undergraduates, a new menace arose from an unexpected quarter. Wisely or unwisely, <b>our</b> <b>medical</b> college had linked up with an organization (AMA) which assumed the task of defining and dictating standards for medical schools, {{with a view to}} eliminating incompetent institutions. While the step we took looked innocent enough at first, the inevitable result of tying up an institution of our own with an organization of entirely different aims, soon showed itself in a surprising way. A new standard was promulgated, requiring that all entrants to a standard medical college should present their credits from a school that was registered as standard by an association of educators who had assumed a similar task of standardizing literary schools.|$|E

2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it."

60|$|Nearly {{the whole}} of <b>our</b> <b>medical</b> {{profession}} and most of our apparatus for teaching and training doctors subsist on strictly commercial lines by earning fees.
