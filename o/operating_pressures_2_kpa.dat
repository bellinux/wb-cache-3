40|$|In this paper, a {{colorful}} schlieren system without any protecting windows was introduced {{which results in}} that the 1. 2 m primary mirror would directly be confronted with the pressure and temperature variation from the wind tunnel test. To achieve a good schlieren image under the wind tunnel test working condition of a wide temperature fluctuation range (- 10 °C to 50 °C) {{as well as a}} <b>pressure</b> (<b>2</b> <b>kPa),</b> a new flexible support method of the primary mirror was strategically designed. A finite element model of the primary mirror combined with its supporting structures was built up to approach the surface figure of the primary mirror under the complex working conditions as gravity, temperature variation, and pressure. The schlieren images due to the change of the primary mirror surface figure were simulated by Light-tools software. It was found that the temperature changing and pressure would lead to the variation of the surface figure of the primary mirror surface figure and therefore, results in the changing of the quality of simulated schlieren images. © 2017 SPIE. </p...|$|R

A two-dimensional fluid simulation of the number densities of surface preparation species in a low-temperature, low-pressure, non-equilibrium Ar+H 2 plasma is conducted. The <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> and H <b>2</b> partial <b>pressure</b> have been varied between 70 - 200 mTorr and 0. 1 - 50 %, respectively.

40|$|Concepts of Propellant Management Devices (PMDs) were {{designed}} for lunar descent stage reaction control system (RCS) and lunar ascent stage (main and RCS propulsion) missions using liquid oxygen (LO 2) and liquid methane (LCH 4). Study ground rules set a maximum of 19 days from launch to lunar touchdown, and an additional 210 days on the lunar surface before liftoff. Two PMDs were conceptually designed {{for each of the}} descent stage RCS propellant tanks, and two designs for each of the ascent stage main propellant tanks. One of the two PMD types is a traditional partial four-screen channel device. The other type is a novel, expanding volume device which uses a stretched, flexing screen. It was found that several unique design features simplified the PMD designs. These features are (1) high propellant tank <b>operating</b> <b>pressures,</b> (<b>2)</b> aluminum tanks for propellant storage, and (3) stringent insulation requirements. Consequently, it was possible to treat LO 2 and LCH 4 as if they were equivalent to Earth-storable propellants because they would remain substantially subcooled during the lunar mission. In fact, prelaunch procedures are simplified with cryogens, because any trapped vapor will condense once the propellant tanks are pressurized in space...|$|R

The operating gas for these two cases is nitrogen and the computations are compared to experimental data. One test condition is at a total enthalpy of 15. 2 MJ/Kg and a relatively low static <b>pressure</b> of <b>2</b> <b>kPa.</b> This case {{is characterized by a}} laminar boundary layer and significant chemical nonequilibrium in the acceleration gas. The second test condition is at a total enthalpy of 10. 2 MJ/Kg and a static pressure of 38 kPa and is characterized by a turbulent boundary layer. For both cases, the time-varying test gas pressure predicted by the simulations is in good agreement with experimental data. The computations are also found to be in good agreement with Mirels' correlations for shock tube flow. It is shown that the nonuniformity of the test gas observed in the HYPULSE expansion tube is strongly linked to the boundary layer thickness. The turbulent flow investigated has a larger boundary layer and greater test gas nonuniformity. In order to investigate possibilities of improving expansion tube flow quality by reducing the boundary layer thickness, parametric studies showing the effect of density and turbulent transition point on the test conditions are also presented.

Both devices consist of two tightly coupled parts: a mechanical resonator, which produces high-frequency mechanical oscillation from quasi-constant airflow; and a permanent magnet/coil system, which generates electrical power from the resonator’s motion. The proposed micro-generators obviate the typically required matching of the resonant frequencies of the scavenger and the ambient energy sources it taps. This enables a device that is simpler, smaller, and higher-frequency than previously reported resonant power generator. The windbelt-based micro-generator demonstrated a peak-to-peak output voltage of 81 mV at 0. 53 kHz, from an input pressure of 50 kPa.

This has implication for theories relating swelling pressures to interlayer distances or surface areas and implies the need for a geometrical pproach to the study of swelling in smectites. Location of isomorphous substitution i the tetrahedral sheet of smectites results in an increased lateral extension of overlapping layers.

This test standard relies on visual observation of flame propagation inside of a spherical glass vessel.

The current standard specifies the electrodes to be placed vertically in the flame path, hindering the propagation of the flame. The rubber stopper that seals the vessel is prone to leak and also vent before the flame fully propagates, skewing the results of the test.

Prior to Test No. 2, test article configuration was modified with the correct proximity gage locations. Deflection data were successfully acquired during Test No. 2. However, the proximity gage deflection measurements were adversely affected by temperature increases. Deflections measured after the temperature rise at the proximity gages were considered unreliable.

Data from this test should be used to determine if the igniter inner joint gasket seals are capable of maintaining sealing capability at a joint displacement of (1. 4) x (0. 0031 in.) = 0. 00434 inches. Additional testing should be performed to increase the database on igniter deflections and address launch commit criteria temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The report {{summarizes}} a computational {{jet noise}} study {{of an ideal}} contoured plug-nozzle (CPN). The gasdynamics of the jet flows have been predicted using the CFD code, NPARC with k-epsilon turbulence model; these data are then used as inputs to perform the noise computations based on the modified version of General Electric MGB code. The study covers a range of <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, <b>2.</b> 0 less than xi less than 5. 0 (shockless flow at design pressure ratio, xi(d) = 3. 62). The agreement of the computational aeroacoustics results with the available experimental data may {{be considered to be}} favorable. The computational results indicate consistent noise reduction effectiveness of the CPN at all <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios. At the design pressure ratio (shockless), the codes predict overall sound pressure levels within + 3. O dB of the experimental data. But at the off-design pressure ratios (flaws with shocks), the agreement is rather mixed. The theory overpredicts the OASPL's at all pressure ratios except at lower angles to the jet axis in overexpanded mode (xi less than xi(d)), the deviations being within 4. 5 dB. The mechanism of shock formations in the CPN jet flows is noted to be basically different from those in the convergent-divergent nozzle jet flows...|$|R
40|$|A low-pressure, fuel-rich flat {{flame of}} {{acetylene}} and oxygen was characterized experimentally by mapping temperature and the profiles of mole fractions for 38 stable species and free radicals. Flame <b>pressure</b> was <b>2.</b> 67 <b>kPa</b> (20 torr), and the feed mixture of 46. 5 mol % C 2 H 2, 48. 5 % 02, and 5. 0 % Ar (0 = 2. 40) was introduced through the water-cooled burner at 0. 5 m-s- 1 (298 K). In addition, 174 stable species with molecular weights 68 to 180 were quantified by GC/MS. Predictions of mole-fraction profiles using the temperature profile and mechanisms {{from the literature}} provide an unprecedented test of mechanisms against such a detailed set of data. While many general features were well-predicted, reaction-path analysis identified causes for serious discrepancies that occurred for some species with all mechanisms.
