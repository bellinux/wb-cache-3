Reflexivity {{is the foundation of}} reflective practice of professional social workers. This article examines the development of a course to promote reflexivity among firstyear social work students in Hong Kong. This included structured experiential learning in the classroom and at a campsite, and student-directed social problem analyses and presentations. Small-group teaching was used to increase student-teacher interaction. Thirty-four students participated in a three-time point study with measurements taken at pre-course, post-course and nine-month follow up. There were statistically significant increases in mean total scores on a standardised scale measuring 'engagement in reflection', 'need for reflection', 'insights', and a decrease in 'personal distress'.

40|$|In {{order to}} advance {{significantly}} scientific <b>objectives,</b> <b>future</b> x-ray astronomy missions will likely call for x-ray telescopes with large aperture areas (approx. = 3 sq m) and fine angular resolution (approx. = 1 "). Achieving such performance is programmatically and technologically challenging {{due to the}} mass and envelope constraints of space-borne telescopes and {{to the need for}} densely nested grazing-incidence optics. Such an x-ray telescope will require precision fabrication, alignment, mounting, and assembly of large areas (approx. = 600 sq m) of lightweight (approx. = 2 kg/sq m areal density) high-quality mirrors, at an acceptable cost (approx. = 1 M$/sq m of mirror surface area). This paper reviews relevant programmatic and technological issues, as well as possible approaches for addressing these issues-including direct fabrication of monocrystalline silicon mirrors, active (in-space adjustable) figure correction of replicated mirrors, static post-fabrication correction using ion implantation, differential erosion or deposition, and coating-stress manipulation of thin substrates...|$|E

Grids will provide a large variety of complex services. The interactions of those services require an extensible and integrated resource management. Although such a coordinated scheduling of services is currently not readily available. Access to resources is typically subject to individual access, accounting, priority, and security policies of the resource owners. Those policies are typically enforced by local management systems. Therefore, an architecture that supports the interaction of independent local management systems with higher-level scheduling services is an important component for Grids.

40|$|Among other goals, the Convention on Biological Diversity {{addresses}} two controversies {{surrounding the}} international system of exchange of crop genetic resources (CGRs). One debate has been over the definition of property rights over CGRs {{and the distribution of}} benefits from their use. The second has been over the adequacy of incentives for conserving CGRs both in situ and ex situ. This paper examines how these two debates are linked and reviews previous multilateral attempts to resolve disputes over genetic resources. The scope for Convention provisions and proposed implementation strategies to resolve disputes and achieve stated goals are assessed. The Convention signals wider international cceptance of both intellectual property rights (IPRs) over biological inventions and the need for multilateral ssistance for CGR preservation. There remains disagreement over how strict future IPRs should become, however, and current proposals to implement the Convention appear inadequate oachieve their stated <b>objectives.</b> <b>Future</b> controversies remain over four broad issues: (1) the breadth of IPR protection, including the future of research and farmer exemptions topatents, (2) control over operation of international seed banks, (3) the need for an international biosafety protocol regulating biotechnology testing and trade, and (4) how biodiversity conservation funds will b ¢ raised and allocated...|$|E

40|$|In many sectors, {{companies}} {{are striving to}} involve suppliers in early phases of product development. This involvement aims at fulfilling new market and business demands such as reducing development time, reducing time-to-market, improving product quality or facilitating the launch of products in a highly competitive environment. In this context, this paper aims at investigating how early supplier involvement can be applied in new product development phases so as to deliver positive outcomes in terms of reducing time to market, improving quality or reducing costs. Especial mention {{will be given to}} how the concept of early supplier involvement can be sketched in a conceptual model {{in such a way that}} it can helps to predict the performance of the project by evaluating the critical success factors that foster the collaboration between buyer and supplier. The results confirm the positive relationship between an effective involvement of the supplier led by a relationship of high quality which positively influences the performance. The results also suggest that certain elements of the involvement are more likely to improve the timing and the extent, leading to significant improvements in cost, quality and time-to-market <b>objectives.</b> <b>Future</b> research is needed in order to further validate the conceptual model proposed.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet their mission <b>objectives,</b> <b>future</b> Space {{exploration}} missions will require a sophisticated and interconnected communication architecture in Space. Their networking requirements will be of increased complexity, thus imposing {{the need for an}} autonomous and dynamic networking model that can cope with the special environmental conditions met in space. The space environment is characterized by very long communication distances and environmental hazards that affect a spacecraft network’s connectivity and communication efficiency by introducing long propagation delays, intermittent connectivity, and unpredictable communication failures. A spacecraft network that operates under these conditions can be categorized as a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN). We use the Predictable Link State Routing (PLSR) protocol and enhance it to cope with these extreme DTN conditions. PLSR is a routing protocol that is designed {{to take advantage of the}} dynamic but predictable spacecraft network topology and to ensure an efficient routing under these conditions. In its current form however, PLSR cannot deal with intermittent connectivity as it appears in a DTN. We develop PLSR−DTN, an efficient enhancement of PLSR that can cope with the intermittent connectivity and that allows efficient routing in future spacecraft networks. Our approach is to provide a DTN functionality only to these network nodes that establish DTN links and that are responsible for maintaining an end-to-end connectivity. More specifically...|$|E

This report reviews some of their achievements since that time. The report begins with a section describing the role of Program Economists and their management. Then follows a brief review of the main areas of interest of each of the twelve economists. A large section of the report is devoted to outlining major areas of research and extension where program economists, often working cooperatively, have made a significant contribution. These areas include: Analyses of market conditions for agricultural products; Field crop economics; Grazing and pasture economics; Integrated weed and pest management economics; Farming systems economics; Provision of farm management information; Research and extension evaluation and policy. Aspects reviewed in these areas included the key findings from research, research <b>objectives,</b> <b>future</b> directions of research and for each area, a selection of the most significant publications produced by program economists. The final section of the report is a listing of publications by program economists since 1997.

40|$|This paper proposes an Asset Liability Management (ALM) {{multistage}} {{stochastic programming}} model {{and a new}} method for measuring and controlling the equilibrium risk of a pension fund in the Brazilian context. According to the Society of Actuaries, ALM {{can be defined as}} an ongoing financial management process of formulating, implementing, monitoring, and revising strategies related to assets, future investments, and liabilities in an attempt to achieve an organization’s financial <b>objectives,</b> <b>future</b> cash flow needs, and capital requirements, given the risk tolerances and other constraints. This is an optimization problem based on a scenario tree structure called multistage stochastic programming model. A pension fund optimal portfolio {{is one of the most}} common ALM applications. The main financial objective of a pension fund is to ensure the benefit payments by investing money from contributions. To do this, the investment policy must assure two conditions: equilibrium and liquidity- long and short term solvency. Several articles in literature have proposed stochastic programming models for optimal investment allocation. However, in all those works, the equilibrium risk is measured at the end of the planning horizon by comparing the final wealth in each scenario to a fixed capital requirement obtained independently from the investment policy adopted, assuming a portfolio of one fixed income contract without risk. We propose a method for measuring and controlling the equilibrium risk that takes into account the fact that the pension fun...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of {{ecological}} differences among urban land covers can guide the sustainable management of urbanized landscapes for conservation of ecosystem services. The objective {{of our study}} was to compare ecosystem properties at the aboveground–belowground interface of three land cover types commonly found in residential landscapes: lawns, bark mulch, and gravel mulch. Using unmowed vegetation as a reference land cover, we measured surface soil variables (to 5 cm depth), CO 2 fluxes, and ground temperatures in experimental field plots within 3 years after their creation. Each land cover had a distinctive set of ecosystem properties. Mulched plots had significantly warmer soil and surface temperatures, wetter soils and faster surface litter decomposition than vegetated plots. Variables associated with soil C and earthworm numbers were consistently lowest in gravel-covered soils, whereas bark mulch plots had highest earthworm abundances, lowest soil bulk density, and temporally variable soil organic matter dynamics. Compared to unmowed plots, lawns had higher soil carbon, CO 2 fluxes, and temperatures but lower earthworm abundances especially during 2005 drought conditions. We conclude that ecosystem properties of the land covers were influenced by the composition, density, and arrangement of materials comprising their aboveground habitat structures. We discuss our results within an ecosystem services framework and suggest that interpretations of our findings depend on in situ urban environmental contexts and landscape management <b>objectives.</b> <b>Future</b> studies of urban land covers, their ecosystem properties and associated ecosystem services are needed to help provide a scientific basis for sustainable urban landscape management...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{pressing}} {{need to understand}} the challenges surrounding procurement of and business case development for hospital electronic prescribing systems, and to identify possible strategies to enhance the efficiency of these processes in order to assist strategic decision making. We organized eight multi-disciplinary round-table discussions in the United Kingdom. Participants included policy makers, representatives from hospitals, system developers, academics, and patients. Each discussion was digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and, together with accompanying field notes, analyzed thematically with NVivo 9. We drew on data from 17 participants (approximately eight per roundtable), six hours of discussion, and 15 pages of field notes. Key challenges included silo planning with systems not being considered as part of an integrated organizational information technology strategy, lack of opportunity for interactions between customers and potential suppliers, lack of support for hospitals in choosing appropriate systems, difficulty of balancing structured planning with flexibility, and the on-going challenge of distinguishing "wants" and aspirations from organizational "needs". Development of business cases for major investments in information technology does not take place in an organizational vacuum. Building on previously identified potentially transferable dimensions to the development and execution of business cases surrounding measurements of costs/benefits and risk management, we have identified additional components relevant to ePrescribing systems. These include: considerations surrounding strategic context, case for change and <b>objectives,</b> <b>future</b> service requirements and options appraisal, capital and revenue implications, timescale and deliverability, and risk analysis and management...|$|E

40|$|The USFWS and Stantec are {{investigating}} the restoration or enhancement of {{a portion of the}} Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge north of Chiloquin OR. The conceptual design of the wetland and riverine habitat restoration is a complex project with a variety of very unique parameters. The land form of the Klamath marsh was primarily formed by the eruption of Crater Lake’s Mount Mazama. The Euro-American agricultural period drained much of the Marsh and created a series of drainage and irrigation channels with structures that inhibit fish passage. The marsh drainage that has occurred during the agricultural period has also limited the beneficial habitat for many wildlife species, including the prelisted Oregon Spotted Frog. The project goals and objects are numerous and include restoring the natural hydrology of the marsh. Other goals are related to fisheries, wildlife and achieving the optimal land use. It is important for the USFWS to be able to balance many conflicting goals and objectives to gain a consensus with the project stakeholders. The design team has been working with the USFWS to identify valley and streams of reference sections of the Williamson River to serve as and design surrogate to enhance the hydrology and habitat of the marsh. The project location is located in a transition of valley types and varies between losing and gaining stream reaches. A landscape based approach as evaluated concept designs for both a single threaded design reach of the Williamson River as well as an anastomosing River reach.
