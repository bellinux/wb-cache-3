25|$|Talk 'Til The Cows Come Home - Two callers would {{compete to}} talk about a certain subject for as long as possible. Chris Smith With the Moos was the a-moo-dicator, who would sound a cow's moos when he {{believes}} they have run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to say. It is based loosely around Radio 4 comedy Just a Minute. It began in late 2014.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times {{felt that}} Madonna {{tried to be}} honest with the concept of American Dream in the album, but ended up {{producing}} songs akin to the [...] "folkie psychobabble" [...] of songwriters like Jewel. James Hannaham from Spin compared the album's introspective themes to her previous albums Ray of Light and Music and also noted Madonna spends much of American Life bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian responded well to parts of the record saying [...] "American Lifes best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music" [...] however his conclusive point in the review was that there was not enough of good songs. The Village Voices Jessica Winter called Madonna's voice [...] "redundant" [...] and commented that [...] "she ironizes 'the American dream' only to pitch woo at her English husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine gave the album a negative review calling the album [...] "about Madonna" [...] instead of American culture explaining, [...] "it's Madonna who, surprisingly, has simply run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to say". BBC's Ian Young also gave a negative review, saying that [...] "the tunes are bland and weak, the lyrics are uninspired and self-absorbed and the semi-Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled—and we are convinced that she has lost it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Winters {{became his}} [...] "idol" [...] early in life; Williams {{first saw him}} on {{television}} at age 8 and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, [...] "that anything is possible, that anything is funny He gave me {{the idea that it}} can be free-form, that you can go in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> pretty easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former {{executive}} producer Niall Mathews believes the soap's success {{is due to}} the large cast and the fact that no single character or group of characters dominates. [...] "Difficulties are inherent if you are dealing with just one family", he says. [...] "Look at Dallas and Dynasty; both did well at the beginning, but because all the action was centred on a single family, the writers ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Packard, {{the core}} {{idea for the}} series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, {{revolving}} around a character named Pete and his adventures. Packard stated, [...] "I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But that night I was running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do." [...] His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending {{for each of the}} paths. [...] "What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the war, Winston Churchill {{consulted}} {{him only}} once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of Éamon de Valera's Ireland. Baldwin saw {{the draft of}} Churchill's speech and advised against it, which advice Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, [...] "I went into Downing Street... a happy man. Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country {{at such a time}} should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him". To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: [...] "You can take it from me he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn't turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies {{in the eyes of the}} world. I pray he is spared to see us through".|$|E
