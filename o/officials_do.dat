The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially off-limits to the public, although state DLNR <b>officials</b> <b>do</b> not regularly monitor the site.

5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A growing number of people believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as {{only a small percentage of}} the country use Swedish as their first language and that a large number of government <b>officials</b> <b>do</b> not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

25|$|The villagers {{hold the}} {{officials}} and the castle in the high regard, {{even though they do}} not appear to know what the <b>officials</b> <b>do.</b> The actions of the officials are never explained.

Everyone appears to have an explanation for the officials' actions, but they often contradict themselves and there is no attempt to hide the ambiguity. Instead, villagers praise it as another action or feature of an official.|$|E

It is unclear if Baby Jesus theft is on the rise as United States federal law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>do</b> not track such theft.

500|$|Although {{the suit}} he filed was rejected, the case {{garnered}} international media attention. Responding {{to questions about}} Chen’s allegation, a senior official with the National Population and Family Planning Commission told the Washington Post {{that the practice of}} forced abortions and sterilizations was “definitely illegal,” and indicated that the complaints were being investigated. “If the Linyi complaints are true, or even partly true, it's because local <b>officials</b> <b>do</b> not understand the new demands of the Chinese leadership regarding family planning work,” said the official. In September 2005, [...] the Commission announced that several Linyi officials had been detained. But local authorities in Linyi retaliated against Chen, placing him under house arrest in September 2005 and embarking on a campaign to undermine his reputation; the Linyi officials portrayed him as working for [...] "foreign anti-China forces", pointing out that he had received foreign funding for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled.|$|E
