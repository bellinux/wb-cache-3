5|$|A polytree is a {{directed}} graph formed by orienting {{the edges of}} a free tree. Every polytree is a DAG. In particular, {{this is true of}} the arborescences formed by directing all edges outwards from the roots <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable of flying vertically {{from the base}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> to the top in a single wing assisted bound.|$|E

5|$|Generally, Manasa is worshiped {{without an}} image. A branch <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too.

5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually the growth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5000|$|More elegantly, via mutual recursion, <b>of</b> which <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} basic examples, <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> can be defined in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest (<b>a</b> list <b>of</b> <b>trees),</b> where <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> value and a forest (the subtrees of its children): f: [...] t: v f ...|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{traversing}} {{time also}} depends on {{the height of the}} tree and frequency of different symbols.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a {{polynomial}} time algorithm to calculate the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ranked gene <b>tree</b> topology for <b>a</b> given species <b>tree,</b> where <b>a</b> ranked <b>tree</b> topology is <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> topology with the internal vertices being ordered. The probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gene <b>tree</b> topology can thus be calculated in polynomial time {{if the number of}} orderings of the internal vertices is a polynomial number. However, the complexity of calculating the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gene <b>tree</b> topology with <b>an</b> exponential number <b>of</b> rankings for <b>a</b> given species <b>tree</b> remains unknown...|$|R
5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, {{plants that are}} usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches {{as a way to}} tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when chariot racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. The participants in this race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by falling out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E
40|$|Till {{current date}} in {{majority}} books on algorithm and research papers, {{they talk about}} height <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> in terms like height balanced binary tree. In this paper the notion <b>of</b> width <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> has been introduced and later the recursive algorithm based on the traversal techniques of the binary tree is given. Later the iterative version of algorithm using the notion of stack is introduced. The width <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> is defined {{based on the number}} of nodes at every level. The highest of all is the width <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>tree.</b> The same concept can be applied to the general tree...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{important}} question to calculate number of grown branches in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> in visualization <b>of</b> trees growth.

5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
50|$|Each node <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>tree,</b> {{and hence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary {{expression}} <b>tree,</b> has zero, one, or two children. This restricted structure simplifies {{the processing of}} expression trees.|$|R

5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E

5|$|The protests {{reached a}} new level of {{visibility}} during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.|$|E
50|$|Another popular {{misconception}} is that <b>a</b> topped <b>tree</b> {{will benefit}} from increased light penetration. The removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trees</b> canopy can have detrimental effects. When <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> is topped, newly formed bark may be susceptible to sun scald. Prolonged exposure can severely damage the bark, thus creating an attractive home for decay causing organisms. Evidence of decay may be the presence of conks (fungal fruiting structures) on the outer tree bark. The loss <b>of</b> leaves reduces <b>a</b> <b>tree's</b> ability to photosynthesize and produce food. If <b>a</b> large <b>tree</b> is unable to produce enough sugars to feed the roots, it will slowly die from starvation.|$|R

5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or at the base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> number <b>of</b> ball <b>tree</b> {{construction}} algorithms are available.
