Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).|$|E

5|$|There are {{multiple}} techniques {{to determine the}} pKa <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical,</b> leading to some discrepancies between different sources.

5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E
25|$|Chemical kinetics, {{also known}} as {{reaction}} kinetics, {{is the study of}} rates of chemical processes. Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> reaction and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, as well as the construction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> reaction.|$|E
25|$|Solubility {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the ability to 'dissolve' a substance, because the solution might also occur because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> reaction. For example, zinc 'dissolves' (with effervescence) in hydrochloric acid as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a displacement reaction. The zinc ions are soluble in the acid.|$|E

25|$|Tissue residue is the {{concentration}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> or compound in an organism’s tissue, or {{a portion of}} an organism’s tissue. Tissue residue is used in aquatic toxicology to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, bioaccumulation of a substance, bioavailability of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism’s exposure to chemical mixtures. A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring {{the concentration}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chemical</b> in the exposure media.|$|E
