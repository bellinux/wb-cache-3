Their low-lying energy levels can be described by a unified analytical expression with two (three) adjustable parameters for <b>even</b> [...] <b>odd</b> (<b>even</b> [...] <b>even)</b> <b>nuclei</b> that {{is derived from the}} fermion dynamical symmetry model. Analytical expressions are given for wavefunctions and for E 2 transition rates that agree well with data. The distinction between the FDSM and IBM SO_ 6 limits is discussed. The experimentally observed suppression of the the energy levels with increasing SO_ 5 quantum number τ can be explained as a perturbation of the pairing interaction on the SO_ 6 symmetry, which leads to an SO_ 5 Pairing effect for SO_ 6 nuclei.

40|$|The {{influence}} of angular momentum on {{the extension of}} deformed regions is studied. Techniques based on the similarity between pairing rotational bands and ordinary rotational bands are used. Indications for an increase of deformation with increasing spin is obtained for rare-earth nuclei with neutron numbers N= 88 - 90. The yrast states of <b>odd</b> and <b>even</b> <b>nuclei</b> and {{of positive and negative}} parity are compared on an absolute scale. It is found that, in the rare-earth region, the odd-even energy difference has almost disappeared for I>or= 14. However, by considering both positive- and negative-parity yrast states, it is concluded that a substantial pairing gap exists also at higher spins. (23 refs) ...|$|R

40|$|At low {{excitation}} energies seniority-zero states {{dominate the}} level density of K = 0 bands in deformed <b>even</b> <b>even</b> <b>nuclei,</b> while they play no role at higher excitation energies. We describe the level densities in a Fermi-gas model {{as well as}} in a combinatorial level-density model and compare to detailed experimental data for some rare-earth nuclei. An explanation is provided for recent observations of an <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> staggering in the spin-distribution function as an effect of r-symmetry of wave functions for deformed nuclei. The structure of 0 (+) states in deformed nuclei is discussed in the model and compared to data, stressing the role of the seniority quantum number.

40|$|The <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effect, i. e., the {{influence}} of the outermost layer of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) on their swelling behavior, is investigated. For that purpose poly(styrene sodium sulfonate) (PSS) /poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) polyelectrolyte multilayers are studied in air with 1 % relative humidity (RH), 30 % RH, 95 % RH, and in liquid water by ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray reflectometry (XRR). Since the total amount of water uptake in swollen PEMs is divided into two fractions, the void water and the swelling water, a correct evaluation of the <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effect is only possible if both fractions are examined separately. In order to allow measuring samples over a larger thickness regime the investigation of a larger amount of samples is required. Therefore, the concept of separating void water from swelling water using neutron reflectometry is for the first time transferred to ellipsometry. The subsequent analysis of swelling water, void water, and roughness revealed the existence of two types of <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effects: an <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effect which addresses only the surface of the PEM (surface-odd even effect) and an <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effect which addresses also the bulk of the PEM (bulk-odd even effect). The appearance of both effects is dependent on the environment; the surface-odd even effect is only detectable in humid air while the bulk-odd even effect is only detectable in liquid water. The bulk-odd even effect is related to the osmotic pressure between the PEM and the surrounding water. A correlation between the amount of void water and both <b>odd</b> <b>even</b> effects is not found. The amount of void water is independent of the terminated layer and the thickness of PEMs...|$|R

If the solutions of LCP(q, M) are nondegenerate and their number is <b>odd</b> (<b>even),</b> we say that the solution set has <b>odd</b> (<b>even)</b> parity, and Murty has shown that this parity is determined uniquely by M. In this paper the idea of parity is extended to degenerate solutions and, through these, to solution sets containing both degenerate and nondegenerate solutions.

In the even-channel case, the ordinary localization behavior arises and g decays exponentially with increasing L. It is also shown that the decay of g is much faster in the odd-channel case than in the even-channel case. These numerical results are in qualitative agreement with existing analytic theories.

In fact, only electrons in odd orbitals (with l odd) contribute to the total parity: an odd number of electrons in odd orbitals (those with an odd l such as in p, f,...) correspond to an odd term symbol, while an even number of electrons in odd orbitals correspond to an even term symbol. The number of electrons in even orbitals is irrelevant as any sum of even numbers is even.
