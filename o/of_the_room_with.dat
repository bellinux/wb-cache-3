5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a bright blue light, then letting {{the rest of the}} set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
25|$|To {{the left}} of the Entrance Hall, {{mirroring}} the Living Room is the Dining Room. The room features rounded curio cabinets in the north end corners of the room, and black marble flooring in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> carpet around the perimeter. Connected to the Dining Room is the Kitchen that was not open to the public until 1995, as Elvis' aunt Delta used it until her death in 1993.|$|E
25|$|This {{area was}} a sacred burial {{site for the}} aliʻi (ruling class). Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina's {{original}} home {{was similar to that}} of the other estates in the neighborhood consisting of small buildings used for different purposes. The sitting and sleeping area had a folding door entrance of green painted wood under glass upper panels. The house had two rooms separated by a festooned tent door of chintz fabric and was carpeted with hand crafted makaloa mats. In the front was a lounge area opposite a sideboard and mirror. In the middle they placed a semi circle of armchairs with a center table where the couple would write. Four matching cabinet-bookshelves with glass doors were set in each corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> silk scarves hanging from each. In his book, A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. Ship Vincennes: during the years 1829 and 1830, Charles Samuel Stewart describes the area and homes in detail.|$|E
60|$|It {{was decided}} that the twins should occupy one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> a double bed. Gif and Spouter took the other double bed, and Fred and Jack went into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{containing}} two single beds.|$|R
40|$|In former {{times it}} was usual to use tar parquetry adhesives. Tar could be {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> contamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In this study we investigated parquetry adhesives, dust, indoor air and outdoor air. The most important PAH compound is the benz(a) pyrene (BaP). The indoor air was not significant contaminated with BaP. The values for the BaP in the parquetry adhesives were very high. But only in one case, {{it was possible to}} find a contamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust. In this <b>room</b> <b>the</b> parquetry by itself was defect. In all <b>the</b> other <b>rooms</b> we could not find any contamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust. <b>The</b> contamination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> BaP depends on conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parquetry.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed around the perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|In Deathly Hallows, the {{students}} who {{need a place to}} hide from the Carrows, two Death Eater professors, use the room. It is also revealed that the Room of Requirement's current version can change while still occupied, though should a completely different version be required (e.g. the Room of Hidden Things instead of DA Headquarters) the room must be empty. The Room can also answer to the desire of the wizard within the room, such as providing Harry with a whistle when he needed one during a Dumbledore's Army meeting, or creating a passage to the Hog's Head (as the room cannot produce food). Later, Ravenclaw's diadem is found to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and has been hidden in the Room of Hidden Things by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the Room, with Harry knowing that he must look for a place to hide things, and find the tiara; but they are ambushed by Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. The diadem is finally destroyed when Crabbe fills this version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> <b>with</b> what Hermione believes to have been Fiendfyre; a destructive magical fire. It is not known if the room continues to function after the events of Deathly Hallows; Ron expresses concern that it may have been ruined in all of its forms by the cursed fire.|$|E
500|$|One {{novel that}} did not appear in Startling was Isaac Asimov's Pebble in the Sky, which Merwin had {{commissioned}} from Asimov in the early summer of 1947. [...] After {{the unusual step of}} allowing the editor to twice read the work-in-progress and receiving nothing but approval, Asimov delivered a completed draft in September. This time, Merwin asked for revisions: Leo Margulies, Merwin's boss, had decided that Startling needed to focus more on action and adventure in the style of Amazing, and less on cerebral stories in the style of Astounding. [...] Asimov, [...] "for the first and only time of [...] life...openly lost [...] temper with an editor", stalked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> his manuscript and never submitted anything to Merwin again, though he later expressed a softening of feeling and admitted Merwin had been within his rights.|$|E

2500|$|When drunk, Kelly {{would be}} heard singing Irish songs; in this state, she would often become quarrelsome and even abusive to those around her, which earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dark Mary." [...] McCarthy said [...] "she {{was a very}} quiet woman when sober but noisy when in drink." [...] Barnett first met Kelly in April 1887. They agreed to live together on their second meeting the following day. In early 1888 they both moved into 13 Miller's Court, a furnished single room {{at the back of}} 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. It was a single twelve-foot square room, with a bed, three tables and a chair. Above the fireplace hung a print of [...] "The Fisherman's Widow". Kelly's door key was lost, so she bolted and unbolted the door from outside by putting a hand through a broken window beside the door. A German neighbour, Julia Venturney, claimed Kelly had broken the window when drunk. Barnett worked as a fish porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, but when he fell out of regular employment and tried to earn money as a market porter, Kelly turned to prostitution again. A quarrel ensued over Kelly's sharing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> another prostitute whom Barnett knew only as [...] "Julia" [...] and he left on 30 October, more than a week before her death, while continuing to visit Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|Regina later {{arrives with}} a locator spell {{to make their}} {{tracking}} of Emma easier. However, after Henry mentioned that Emma drove off, Hook suspects that Emma went to see Gold, so he sneaks off and makes {{a phone call to}} warn Emma about Gold's deception. Meanwhile, David and Mary Margret decide that it might not be so bad if Emma got rid of her magic and became [...] "normal," [...] which causes Elsa, who overhead their conversation, to sneak out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> the locator potion to try to find Emma on her own. Hook isn't the only one to suspect Gold, as Ingrid soon discovers Gold's plot after he visits her. It turns out that he needs Emma's power, which means that in order to do that, he has betrayed Ingrid by preventing her from taking Emma. When Ingrid tries to stop Gold, he uses a spell that he collected from remnants of the urn, creating a force field to prevent Ingrid from warning Emma or interfering in the events to come. As Ingrid sees Emma traveling to the mansion, Ingrid uses her mirror to send an illusion of her to stop Emma. When Emma sees the sudden appearance of Ingrid's figure {{in the middle of the}} road, her car spins out of control and crashes, causing Emma to temporarily lose consciousness.|$|E
