5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age {{want to avoid}} {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however {{were not able to}} access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the spatial concentration of deprived households and teenage non-marital childbearing. Associations with area deprivation are tested before and after allowing for levels of personal deprivation.  DESIGN AND SETTING—The individual data are derived from the 2 % sample of anonymised records (SAR) from the census of 1991  in Great Britain, and are combined with area data from the 278  districts of residence identifiable in the SAR.  PARTICIPANTS—Sample is restricted to unmarried women living at home (with at least one parent) and aged 16  to 19.  MAIN RESULTS—The results suggest generally higher risk <b>of</b> teenage <b>childbearing</b> {{for women who are}} economically inactive, women from households with no access to a car or households resident in local authority accomodation. Without adjusting for personal circumstances, the risk of teenage pregnancy shows a clear, significant and approximately linear association with social deprivation of area of residence in 1991.  Residual analysis shows that many urban areas have much higher levels <b>of</b> teenage <b>childbearing</b> than expected. When adjustment is made for personal disadvantage the simple association with local area deprivation is attenuated. A higher risk <b>of</b> teenage <b>childbearing</b> is still seen in urban areas while the areas having the highest negative differentials are heterogeneous.  CONCLUSIONS—Both individual and spatial characteristics are important in influencing levels <b>of</b> teenage <b>childbearing.</b> Teenage childbearing shows an association with residence in more deprived areas. The association seems to be largely because residence in more deprived areas is associated with personal disadvantage, which increases the risk <b>of</b> teenage <b>childbearing.</b> Area characteristics are of lesser significance in determining teenage non-marital childbearing than individual and household characteristics.    Keywords: teenage preganancy; povert...|$|R

25|$|Sociobiologists and {{evolutionary}} psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape {{may be a}} mating strategy in humans, {{as a way for}} males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations. Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women. Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.|$|E

25|$|Thornhill and Palmer {{argue that}} these two {{theories}} are the strongest of the ten for several reasons. For example, both hypothesis argue rape exists because it functions to increase matings, thus improving reproductive success. Because rape can be a costly behaviour for the male - he risks injury inflicted by the victim, or punishment by her social allies, it must have strong reproductive benefits for the behaviour to survive and be demonstrated today. Thornhill and Palmer also use several facts to {{support the idea that}} the two evolutionary based hypotheses are the most reasonable. They argue that the fact that most rape victims are <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age, that married women and women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age suffer more psychological distress after rape than single or post-menopausal women, and that rape takes place in a variety of other species, all point towards an evolutionary heritage for the rape behaviour.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{empirical}} relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and rates <b>of</b> early <b>childbearing.</b> First, we use {{data from the}} Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to confirm a strong correlation {{at the individual level}} - women who grow up "disadvantaged" {{are much more likely to}} give birth as teens. Then we aggregate Vital Statistics microdata from 1968 through 2003 to conduct a cohort-based analysis of the relationship between rates of socioeconomic disadvantage of a birth cohort and the cohort's subsequent early childbearing experiences. Our cohort level analysis implies an even tighter intergenerational correlation between rates of background disadvantage and early childbearing. But, when our analysis econometrically controls for fixed state and year of birth effects in the model to account for cultural and other differences across cohorts, the relationship between rates of disadvantage and early childbearing is found to be quite modest. For example, the elasticity <b>of</b> early <b>childbearing</b> rates by age 18 with respect to the probability of being born to a mother under age 18 is only 0. 05.
