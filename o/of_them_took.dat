5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning the Spanish and French fleets were 12 miles apart. Comte du Daugnon, Brézé's successor, decided set sail to Porto Ercole to make repairs instead of pursuing the Spanish fleet, which had sought refuge behind the Giglio island. Linhares chased him during all the 15th {{and part of}} the 16th. 4 French storeships, unaware of the main fleet's departure, fell amidst the Spanish fleet the first night, but managed to escape by following Linhares maneuvers. The Spanish admiral finally abandoned the pursuit to relieve Orbetello. This proved to be impossible because a storm dispersed most of the ships during the night. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> refuge in Sardinia; others at Giglio and Montecristo. The galley Santa Bárbara sank off Giglio, causing the death of 46 rowers. The French also suffered from the storm. One of their galleys, la Grimaldi, sank off Piombino, although its crew and artillery was taken aboard the Spanish fleet. Another ship, Saint-Dominique, lagged behind along with a fireship and was captured by Pimienta off Cape Corse.|$|E

Also, few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> refuge in Chastel-Nouvel. But the walls were insufficient, and could not prevent the pillages. This period isolated Mende from its neighbours, including Le Puy-en-Velay, and waited the arrival of the Constable of France, Bertrand du Guesclin, then the intervention of Charles VI and the liberation of the region so that the roads reopened around 1452.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to JG 132, many fighter units were organized at Lippstadt {{in the late}} 1930s, forming the core units of the wartime Luftwaffe. JG 134, also with He 51s and Arado Ar 68Es, another biplane fighter was formed a week later. In April 1937, Kampfgeschwader 254 (KG 254) was formed with Junkers Ju 52 transports, similar to the Douglas C-47; JG 142 in November 1938 with early-model Messerschmitt Bf 109C models; Zerstörergeschwader 142 (ZG 142), in January 1939 with Bf 109C and Ds, and ZG 26 in May 1939 also with Bf 109Ds. All of these units were deployed to other airfields around Germany, and most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> part in the Conquest of Poland in September 1939.|$|E
25|$|The various dissidents {{formed a}} pro-Thi, anti-Kỳ {{organization}} called the Military-Civilian Struggle Committee, {{better known as the}} Struggle Movement. Their message and influence quickly spread. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> over the government radio station in Da Nang and made anti-junta broadcasts, and they were joined by university students. Initially this dissident soapboxing was not treated with much alarm and it was thought that the regime had decided to wait for the protests to peter out instead of risking an escalation by trying to suppress it. The administrator at Da Nang's radio station allowed the Thi supporters to make a broadcaster when only ten student protesters turned up, a minuscule amount of popular pressure. The opposition groups were not well organized at this time and seemed unsure of their objectives. They were also conducting themselves placidly at this point.|$|E
25|$|To pay {{the initial}} rent on the Downshire Hill house, Shaw sold {{many of his}} books and Craig pawned the gold watch which Henry Irving had given him. From the outset, the Society was run on a shoe-string using gifted amateur musicians and singers (75 in all), {{recruited}} from Martin Shaw and Nannie Dryhurst's Hampstead friends, supplemented by two professionals for the leads. Shaw arranged the scores, rehearsed and trained the singers and conducted all the productions. Craig not only designed and directed all the productions, he also produced and illustrated the programmes and designed the Society's stationery and posters. Neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> any pay. Craig's sister, Edith Craig, also worked on their productions as did the painter Jean Inglis and the scenic artist William Thompson Hemsley. Rehearsals took place in private houses in Hampstead, first in a large room in Guyon House lent to them by William Boulting, and later at Lested Lodge in Well Walk.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to how the}} Protestant Reformers {{were often}} characterized, {{the concept of a}} catholic or {{universal}} Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began {{in the early days of}} the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
25|$|Still not {{realising}} {{the actual}} {{scale of the}} threat he was facing, Tsulukidze's headquarters in Sanahin was quickly approached and besieged by regular Armenian army units resulting in heavy fighting around the railway station. The Armenians saboutaged rails and also succeeded in ambushing and trapping an armoured train that was carrying two Georgian infantry companies. Tsulukidze withdrew from Sanahin to Alaverdi — which was also being attacked by Armenian forces, using the artillery of the derailed trains to cover his troops' retreat. More Georgian reinforcements arrived on December 12, securing the heights around Alaverdi, but were unsuccessful in breaking out the ~60 Georgians who remained trapped on the rails between the two villages. Another train with reinforcements got derailed on the same day. At that point, the Georgians had less than 700 troops engaged in combat, while most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> defensive positions in Alaverdi, equipped with a few guns and mortars. On December 14, they were encircled by an estimated 4,000 Armenian soldiers from regiments of the 1st and 2nd Rifle Divisions. Confronted with a hopeless situation general Tsulukidze ordered a general retreat and made a successful breakout towards Sadakhlo.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011 Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka {{hosted the}} 50-over World Cup. In the West Indies' second {{game of the}} tournament, Roach became the sixth bowler to have claimed a hat-trick in a World Cup. He {{dismissed}} Pieter Seelaar, Bernard Loots, and Berend Westdijk for his hat-trick {{and went on to}} claim 6/27, the fourth-best bowling figures by a West Indies player in ODIs. He was the West Indies' leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 13wickets from 6matches. Roach played just four Tests in 2011, and took seven wickets at a cost of over 50runs each. Five players bowled more overs in Tests for the West Indies, and each took more wickets and had a better bowling average; four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>took</b> more than 30wickets. Despite not regularly featuring in the Test side, Roach finished the year as the team's leading wicket-taker in ODIs with 30dismissals from 23matches at an average of 31.16. Roach signed a contract in August 2011 to represent Worcestershire in English domestic cricket. At the time the club was struggling to avoid relegation from the first division of the County Championship, the first-class competition, and in the final game of the season managed to ensure they stayed up. According to Roach Worcestershire's seam bowler Alan Richardson helped him learn how to bowl in English conditions, and took 14 first-class wickets at an average of 39.28.|$|E
