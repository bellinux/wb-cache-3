5|$|Episode {{director}} Neil Affleck {{was praised}} {{by the staff}} for his directing in this episode. In the scene where Chief Wiggum falls <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his bedroom, unable to roll over or get back up, Affleck decided to act out the scene for the staff to showcase how Affleck envisioned Chief Wiggum's predicament. Affleck was also praised {{for his ability to}} create three new elaborate settings in the episode: the science museum, the Springfield penitentiary, and the large toy store.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who was laying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved {{out of the way and}} then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of the}} ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E

25|$|The suspects' {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} computers contained multiple video {{recordings of the}} murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly {{in the face with}} a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.|$|E
500|$|Drake's outward {{appearance}} is fairly generic, {{consisting of a}} simple white shirt and {{blue jeans and a}} gun holster <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the first game, and a brown henley in the second. He was deliberately costumed in a simple shirt and jeans to provide a [...] "blank slate" [...] on which the everyman persona could be imposed. The programmers designed a layered-animation system to make Drake's motions realistic by blending multiple poses and reactions together. This allowed a complex facial and wrinkle mapping system, which provided Drake more human emotional reactions. Drake's physique is fairly fit, but not overly muscular.|$|E
500|$|In honour of Harrison's {{fondness for}} the instrument, Paul McCartney played a ukulele {{rendition}} of [...] "Something" [...] throughout his 2002–03 world tour and included the track <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. live album. At the Concert for George, held at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, he and Eric Clapton performed a version {{that begins with}} McCartney alone, on ukulele, and then reverts to the familiar, rock arrangement, with Clapton taking over as lead singer and backing from Starr, Preston and others. Following its appearance in David Leland's film Concert for George (2003) and on the accompanying live album, this performance of [...] "Something" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Bob Dylan also played the song live during his November 2002 concerts, {{as a tribute to}} Harrison. McCartney has continued to perform [...] "Something", adopting the Concert for George mix of ukulele and rock backing; a version with this musical arrangement was included on his 2009 album Good Evening New York City.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins and}} ends with the band in a {{hospital}} setting watching an old man being administered medication through an IV drip. The majority of the video {{takes place in a}} surreal outdoor setting that incorporates imagery from the film The Wizard of Oz. During the song's first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces a young girl in a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back. In the video's final cut, the band is only shown performing in the outdoor setting during the choruses, where Cobain's face moves in and out of focus in the camera. While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song's final chorus. Corbijn created another cut of the video featuring alternate footage during the final verse, including more shots of the young girl and the woman, and scenes of Cobain lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the poppy field, with mist surrounding him. This version of the video is featured on the DVD [...]|$|E
500|$|Burnham {{was first}} {{captured}} during the fighting at Sanna's Post in the Orange Free State. He gave {{himself up in}} order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied Bloemfontein safely after two days and nights on the run. [...] The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching Thaba' Nchu. He came upon a group of Boers hiding {{on the banks of the}} river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee, limping heavily and groaning with pain. He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself, and fell between the legs of the oxen <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the road. In an instant, the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veld. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of [...] "mielies" [...] (i.e., maize).|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel cage match contested between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper), with the losing team {{disbanding}} forever. Mid-way through, Skipper handcuffed Harris to {{the ropes and}} kept the key away from the referee. Storm later took the key from Skipper and freed Harris from the cuffs. [...] At {{one point in the}} match, Skipper and Daniels double teamed Harris and performed America's Most Wanted signature finishing maneuver, the Death Sentence by holding Harris in place while the other member climbed to the top rope and performed a leg drop across Harris's neck and head. Skipper followed by covering Harris for a pinfall, however, he kicked out before the count of three. Harris later climbed {{up to the top of}} the cage. While Harris sat on top of the cage, Skipper climbed up at another corner and walked across the top similar to walking a tightrope. Skipper then jumped and grabbed Harris's head with his legs, falling backwards towards the ring in a move he dubbed the New School. This move caused Harris to fly off of the top of the cage and land <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the ring. A brief time later, all four men were positioned at certain points on one of the padded turnbuckles to perform what TNA calls the [...] "Tower of Doom". In a variation of the move, Daniels was being held upside-down by Storm, until Skipper grabbed Storm and placed his head between Storm's legs to lift him off of a padded turnbuckle. Harris then grabbed Skipper and placed Skipper on his shoulders while he held Storm, who remained holding Daniels. Harris then performed a powerbomb on Skipper, while Skipper pulled down Storm, who suplexed Daniels off of the top of the cage. The conclusion to the match saw America's Most Wanted cuff Daniels to the ropes and perform Triple X's signature maneuver, the Powerplex by lifting Skipper up onto Storm's shoulders while Harris held Skipper's head. Storm and Harris then fell to the mat, forcing Skipper's neck into Harris's shoulder and mat while slamming his back into the mat as well. Storm then pinned Skipper for the pinfall victory. As a result of Triple X's loss, the team had to disband forever.|$|E

An autopsy revealed that Kim had died because of hypothermia and that his body had suffered no incapacitating physical injuries. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy guessed that Kim had died roughly two days after leaving the vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|... is a {{powerful}} magician from the country of Celes. He travels to Yūko on his own accord after sealing his king Ashura-ō and having his creation, Chī, alert him if Ashura awakens. He wishes never {{to return to his}} country, so he gives up a tattoo <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> exchange for Mokona to travel through dimensions. Having lost his tattoo, Fai decides not to use magic anymore and relies on weapons to battle. Fai appears to be cheerful and good-natured, and acts very carefree. He often teases Kurogane, who questions this nature, sensing that it is just a false persona to hide that he is emotionally distant. Fai does not bother to fight hard for his life, and will only do so if someone he cares for is in danger, which Kurogane notes to be Syaoran and Sakura, as he uses magic to help them. He is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in the anime adaptation, and by Vic Mignogna in the English adaptation.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is clear}} from Stevenson's account that Ananda Mahidol could not have killed himself, either by suicide (as is {{sometimes}} suggested) or by accident. He was found lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his bed, not wearing his glasses, without which he was almost blind. He had a small bullet wound in his forehead and a somewhat larger exit wound {{in the back of}} his head. His pistol, a Colt [...]45 given him by a former US Army officer, was not nearby. The M1911 Colt is not especially prone to accidental discharge; it will fire only if considerable pressure is applied to the safety plate at the back of the butt at the same time as the trigger is depressed. It is a heavy pistol and awkward to use by an untrained person. It would have been almost impossible for Ananda Mahidol, a frail 20-year-old, to lie on his back and shoot himself in the forehead with such a weapon. Had he done so, the impact, according to forensics experts, would have blown his skull apart, not caused the small wounds seen by many witnesses. Stevenson writes that no cartridge case was found, and subsequent inquiries ordered by King Bhumibol, but suppressed by later governments, found that the Colt had not been fired.|$|E
2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E
