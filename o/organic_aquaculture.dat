40|$|In Bangladesh, black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon; Fabricius, 1798) {{aquaculture}} {{has come}} {{to be one of the}} most important sectors in both the rural and national economies. Likewise, <b>organic</b> shrimp <b>aquaculture</b> has emerged as an alternative farming enterprise for farmers especially in the southwestern districts of Bangladesh. The present study aims to show key performance characteristics of organic shrimp farmers and farming in a prototypical shrimp farming area in Bangladesh. Data was collected in 2009 from organic shrimp farmers in the Kaligonj and Shyamnagar sub-districts through questionnaire interviews, transect walks and focus group discussions. The mean productivity of organic shrimp farming in the area is 320 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 (ranging from 120 to 711 kg ha− 1 year− 1 ). Organic farmers are more likely to have a higher monthly income and less aquaculture experience. Moreover, suitable landholdings and classified labor distribution have been found to play an important role in the development of <b>organic</b> shrimp <b>aquaculture.</b> The most common assets of <b>organic</b> shrimp <b>aquaculture</b> are high yield, low production cost, available post larvae and high market prices.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of <b>organic</b> sea bream <b>aquaculture</b> production in Greece, in particular its consequences for fish growth, health and body composition, and to propose and update standards for sustainable organic sea bream farming. Gilthead sea bream were kept in sea cages at densities of 4 kg m (3) (organic) and 15 kg m (3) (conventional), and were fed organically produced feed (45 % crude protein, 14 % fat) or conventional feed (46 % crude protein, 17 % fat). The amino acid profile of the conventional diet, particularly the lysine content, which is one of most important dietary amino acids for sea bream, appeared to be unsatisfactory. "Organic" sea bream stored less fat content in their white muscle than the conventional sea bream. The liver lipid content was lower and the hepatosomatic index was higher for the organic sea bream. The microbiological analysis showed that both Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli on the skin were below the enumeration detection limit in both the organic and conventional sea bream. Total viable counts on the skin and muscle of both the organically and conventionally cultured sea bream were approximately 3 log cfu g(- 1), which is well below the acceptable limit (7 log cfu g(- 1)) for marine species. The results showed that the combination of a low stocking density and feed with a different ingredient composition but similar nutritional value resulted in similar growth rates and nutrient profiles of the final product. Further research on nutrition is required to provide information on setting the appropriate standards for <b>organic</b> sea bream <b>aquaculture</b> to ensure that the final product is in line with the consumers' preferences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using an annular flume, erosion {{characteristics}} of five diverse sediment types (stormwater pond, contaminated lacustrine, fluvial, aquaculture waste and industrial grade kaolin sediment), each with different physical and biological characteristics, were examined for relative erosion resistance and {{factors contributing to}} bed sediment stability. Suspended flocs represent primary building blocks of bed sediment with mass settling being independent of suspended solid con-centration. Biofilm growth period, depositing floc structure and composition, nutrient supply and sediment properties all played a complex role in dictating {{the stability of the}} sediments. The river, lake and stormwater pond sediments were the most resistant to erosion relative to the high nutrient and <b>organic</b> content <b>aquaculture</b> sediment and kaolin. Biofilms developed to varying degrees on all sediments with the greatest growth occurring with the aquaculture sediment and the least with kaolin. While electrochemical properties will provide some attraction and stabilising forces, with no measurable consolidation evident for the examined sediments, it is suggested that active biofilm development was the dominant factor controlling bed stability and erosion potential. Differences in biological mediation of strength between sediments were partially attributed to the structural differences within the biofilms and integration of the extracellular polymeric fibril matrix within the sediment pores...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Abundance-Biomass {{comparison}} (ABC) {{was applied}} to assess the level of environmental disturbance by {{the changes in the}} pattern of abundance and biomass of macrobenthic assemblages taken from various types of sediments. In the most sedimentary habitats, polychaetes usually dominate the structure and considered the most tolerant to stress associated with organic loading and low oxygen levels, thus effective as environmental indicator using ABC curve. The aim the study is to assess the environmental changes caused by Aquaculture activities using ABC curve of polychaetes assemblages as presented using the Shannon-Wiener (H’) index at the studied areas. The results showed that approach to multivariate and graphical methods, especially using ABC curves can sensitively detect any environmental change, particularly changes in polychaetesassemblages, water quality and sediment over time.

40|$|In Newfoundland, {{assessing}} {{benthic community}} changes associated with organic matter enrichment near finfish farms is challenging {{because the majority}} of aquaculture sites are in deep waters, over hard, patchy substrata, where soft sediment sampling methods are ineffective. A promising approach is the use of video surveys to analyze epibenthic characteristics, including taxa that are indicative of organic matter enrichment, Beggiatoa spp. and OPC. Here, I compare seafloor biotic and abiotic characteristics on temporal and spatial scales over 2 years and at six locations. Benthic organisms and indicators were identified and evaluated in relation to distance to cage, aquaculture production status and environmental conditions. Abundance and percent cover of the benthos, with the exception of bio-indicators, was higher in non-production sites compared to the production and fallow sites, with minimal changes over time. <b>Organic</b> enrichment via <b>aquaculture</b> can lead to long term benthic changes (> 1 year) on hard substrata...|$|R

40|$|The {{microbial}} {{decomposition of}} nitrogen-rich <b>organic</b> matter in <b>aquaculture</b> ponds {{is affected by}} the oxic-anoxic conditions gradient at the soil¿water interface as well as by resuspension practices. To investigate these interactions, the decomposition of a 49 % protein fish feed was analyzed in 10 marine lab-scale systems with different exposures to aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The degree of coupling between oxic and anoxic conditions in the system had a strong effect on product accumulation and loss from the culture system. Pure oxic or anoxic conditions proved to be less favorable than mixed aerobic¿anaerobic systems with respect to the metabolites accumulated in the system. Short 15 -min resuspension events and a continuous alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions at 12 -h time intervals proved to be the best options to minimize the accumulation of organic matter in the systems. The correct coupling of aerobic¿anaerobic conditions in space and time is a key to maintain a good water quality condition for the cultured animals and also to improve the decomposition and recycling of organic matter, reducing the environmental impact from the effluent...|$|R
40|$|Turbidity is an {{important}} index to evaluate the water quality. Turbidity can reflect the effects of insoluble substances that contain bait and seston on water. Traditional methods of turbidity detection are complicated, they have low efficiency and poor reliability.

After analyzing the quality characteristics of aquaculture water, the light with 880 nm wavelength has been selected as the light source, it can effectively overcome the effect of bait and other <b>organic</b> matter in <b>aquaculture</b> water on turbidity detection. According to the characteristics of turbidity detection, the signal transmitting circuit has been designed to eliminate the effects of noise. So, the accuracy of the sensor is improved. Based on the test experiment on performance of the turbidity sensor, an intelligent correction and compensation model has been designed, which overcomes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the measurement results, improving stability of the turbidity detection. Results of the test have shown that the intelligent turbidity sensor has good stability and reliability, which is suitable for turbidity detection of aquaculture water. ...|$|R
