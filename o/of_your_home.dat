[...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>home.</b> Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan.

60|$|Those {{who have}} never stood at the mast-head of a ship at sea, in a dead calm, cannot {{comprehend}} the feeling of intense solitude, that fills the mind in such a position.

To stand on the summit of a tower and {{look down on the}} busy multitude below is not the same, for there the sounds are quite different in tone, and signs of life are visible all over the distant country, while cries from afar reach the ear, as well as those from below. But from the mast-head you hear only the few subdued sounds under your feet--all beyond is silence; you behold only the small oval-shaped platform that is your world--beyond lies the calm, desolate ocean. On deck you cannot realise this feeling, for there sails and yards tower above you, and masts, and boats, and cordage, intercept your view; but from above you take in the intense minuteness <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> at a single glance--you stand aside, as it were, and, in some measure, comprehend the insignificance of the thing to which you have committed your life.|$|E
6000|$|I {{should have}} been {{to see you again}} long ago if I had not {{suddenly}} been called to America (by the death of my father) in December last. The autumn, before that, I spent altogether abroad, and have scarcely been in England since I bade you good-bye, after that very delightful walk and talk we had together last July--an episode of which I have the happiest, tenderest memory.

60|$|With that {{fidelity}} {{which was}} an instinct of his nature, this brave man thought ever of his absent child, and longed after him. He never forsook the native servants and nurses who had had charge of the child, but endowed them with money sufficient (and indeed little was wanted by people of that frugal race) to make all their future lives comfortable. No friends went to Europe, nor ship departed, but Newcome sent presents and remembrances to the boy, and costly tokens of his love and thanks to all who were kind to his son. What a strange pathos {{seems to me to}} accompany all our Indian story! Besides that official history which fills Gazettes, and embroiders banners with names of victory; which gives moralists and enemies cause to cry out at English rapine; and enables patriots to boast of invincible British valour--besides the splendour and conquest, the wealth and glory, the crowned ambition, the conquered danger, the vast prize, and the blood freely shed in winning it--should not one remember the tears, too? Besides the lives of myriads of British men, conquering on a hundred fields, from Plassey to Meanee, and bathing them cruore nostro: think of the women, and the tribute which they perforce must pay to those victorious achievements. Scarce a soldier goes to yonder shores but leaves a home and grief in it behind him. The lords of the subject province find wives there; but their children cannot live on the soil. The parents bring their children to the shore, and part from them. The family must be broken up--keep the flowers <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> beyond a certain time, and the sickening buds wither and die. In America it is from the breast of a poor slave that a child is taken. In India it is from the wife, and from under the palace, of a splendid proconsul.|$|E
40|$|This guide {{discusses}} the practice <b>of</b> weatherizing <b>your</b> <b>home</b> through weatherstripping. Selection of materials, types of weatherstripping and buying and installing {{these products are}} discussed. Insulation is {{not the whole story}} for energy conservation! Even if <b>your</b> <b>home</b> is well-insulated, energy may be wasted through air infiltration. Air can leak around doors and windows, foundations, chimneys, exterior plumbing, etc. In the winter, air heated by your furnace is lost to the outside; in summer, hot outdoor air puts an extra load on your air conditioner. If <b>your</b> <b>home</b> is typical, one-half to three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fuel bill is the result of air infiltration. Weatherizing <b>your</b> <b>home</b> by caulking and weatherstripping can effectively reduce energy waste.
