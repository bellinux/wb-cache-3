5|$|After Dutch forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta), a {{group of}} {{survivors}} led by Khe Pandjang headed east for Semarang. Despite being warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> uprising, {{the head of the}} Dutch East India Company's military Bartholomeus Visscher ignored his advisers and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to tentatively support the Chinese while seemingly helping the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 1934, {{work began}} on {{the removal of the}} twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was {{conducted}} by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project. Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Stalingrad Front {{forces were}} subject to heavy bombardment, making {{mobilization}} more difficult. The 38 engineer battalions allocated to the front were responsible for ferrying ammunition, personnel and tanks across the Volga River while carrying out minor reconnaissance along sections of the front which were to be the breakthrough points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> offensive. In three weeks the Red Army transported around 111,000 soldiers, 420 tanks and 556 artillery pieces across the Volga.|$|E

5|$|Weather forecasters {{first began}} to notice the {{severity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> weather situation after the 6:00pm CST (0000UTC) computer model runs {{on the night of}} Friday, March 27. On Saturday, March 28 at 11:30am the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day2 moderate risk of severe weather for southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, northwest Illinois and much of Wisconsin. Later model runs on March 28 only increased forecasters' confidence that a major severe-weather event would occur the following day.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act {{out of sync with}} normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Commanding {{his forces}} from Pleiku, Major General Phạm Văn Phú, the III Corps commander, was given {{adequate}} warnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> North Vietnamese attacks, {{but they were}} not given serious consideration. Phú was deceived by an elaborate North Vietnamese communications charade and his belief that PAVN movements toward Buôn Ma Thuột were diversionary operations designed to distract him from the true objective, Pleiku. The defense of Buôn Ma Thuột, therefore, was entrusted to a single Ranger group and provincial Popular and Regional Force units (approximately 4,000 men). They were augmented at the beginning of March by 53rd Regiment of the 23rd ARVN Division.|$|E

5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> attack, and the operation {{failed to achieve}} the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) {{landed on}} the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula, at what {{thereafter}} became known as Anzac Cove. The first Turkish attempts to recapture the ANZAC beachhead were two unsuccessful attacks in April. Just over two weeks later, the Turks had gathered a force of 42,000 men (four divisions) to conduct their second assault against the ANZAC's 17,300 men (two divisions). The ANZAC commanders had no indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> attack until the day before, when British aircraft reported a build-up of troops opposite the ANZAC positions.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} {{passed over the}} Azores, several weather stations reported low barometric pressures, with the lowest being a measurement of 984 mbar (hPa; 29.06 inHg) on Terceira Island at 0600 UTC on September 25. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> storm, several Pan Am Clipper flights to the archipelago were suspended for three consecutive days. The maximum reported gust in the Azores was an observation of 65mph (100km/h) on September25. As a result of moving slowly over the islands, torrential rainfall was also reported. At Angra do Heroísmo, 13.11in (333mm) of precipitation was reported in a four-day, accounting for {{a third of the}} station's yearly average rainfall. Strong storm surge was reported at the same location. The waves swept boats away from the coasts of islands. Further inland, there was extensive damage to homes and crops, though no people died. Despite evidence that the system had distinct tropical characteristics, it was not operationally added to HURDAT.|$|E

50|$|Cooke {{was widely}} {{predicted}} {{to stay in}} power only until the formerly independent District sections of Washington, Georgetown, and Washington County had eased their factional tensions and accepted unified rule over the District, upon which the universally beloved Shepherd would become governor. Cooke suffered a serious setback when Jay Cooke & Co. failed on September 18, 1873, in <b>the</b> Panic <b>of</b> 1873. <b>The</b> <b>impending</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank had already forced his resignation on September 10 as territorial governor.|$|R
5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{the attack}} was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal on the same course {{and at the same}} speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed <b>of</b> TF18 for <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> attack by Hagai's bombers.|$|R
50|$|At Harare, <b>the</b> Heads <b>of</b> Government {{dedicated}} {{themselves to}} applying these principles to then-current issues, such as <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, <b>the</b> near-completion <b>of</b> decolonisation, and <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartheid government in South Africa.

[...] Wallace then returned to his law practice.|$|R
5|$|Stavka {{postponed}} Operation Saturn until 16 December, as Soviet forces {{struggled to}} clear German defenders {{from the lower}} Chir River. The Red Army's offensive in the area commenced on 30 November, involving around 50,000 soldiers, which forced Manstein to use the 48th Panzer Corps {{in an attempt to}} hold the area. In response, the 5th Tank Army was reinforced by the newly created 5th Shock Army, drawn from existing formations of the South-Western and Stalingrad Fronts; the 5th Tank Army totaled nearly 71,000 men, 252 tanks and 814 artillery guns. The Soviet offensive succeeded in tying down the 48th Panzer Corps, originally chosen to lead one of the main attacks on the Soviet encirclement. The Soviets were forewarned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> German assault when they discovered the German 6th Panzer Division unloading at the town of Morozovsk, and as a result, held back several armies from the attack on the lower Chir River to prepare for a possible breakout attempt by German forces inside Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Sweeping through Libreville unopposed, {{the troops}} easily {{captured}} the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka {{military base in}} Lambaréné when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what had been going on. Cousseran dodged answering the question and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
50|$|Akechi Mitsuhide {{controlled}} two castles (Shōryūji and Yodo) in the Yamazaki region. Due to {{his lack}} <b>of</b> men for <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> battle with Hideyoshi, {{he attempted to}} win <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in that region {{in order to gain}} more troops. However, his appeals to Hosokawa Fujitaka were fruitless, and so he was unable to add significant strength to his forces.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> 2001 crash <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{telecommunications}} industry, <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Connecticut filed {{a lawsuit}} against the company and four key executives, claiming that they had misled and hid from company shareholders advance knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's <b>impending</b> downturn. Unlike most similar lawsuits, which are dismissed or settled before trial, Connecticut's lawsuit went to trial in October, 2007. JDSU was acquitted of all charges in November, 2007.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> Fall <b>of</b> Saigon and <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> {{invasion}} <b>of</b> North Vietnam into South Vietnam, Air Viet Nam {{decided to}} assist and help all South Vietnamese citizens {{to escape to}} neighboring countries.

5|$|The parliament's {{discussions on}} Anglo-Scottish {{relations}} preceded peace negotiations {{later in the}} year, at which Bishop Walter {{was one of the}} Scottish envoys. There was some urgency behind the matter, in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> end to the five-year Anglo-Scottish truce agreed by King Edward III of England on 20 May 1365. King David travelled to London, where he resided in May and June, in order {{to take part in the}} negotiations. Walter and the rest of the embassy, which included four other bishops, were in London by June 1369, the month in which Edward agreed to a new truce. When it was ratified by the Scots at Edinburgh on 20 July, Bishop Walter was again present, as a witness.|$|E
5|$|Tipu then {{ordered the}} {{destruction}} of all 27 churches in Canara. According to oral tradition, the Idgah mosque in Mangalore was constructed with stones from the destroyed Milagres Church. Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses, offices, or homes for wealthy Muslims. A popular fortification in Mangalore, the Sultan Battery, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river, was constructed with stones taken from destroyed churches. The bells from the demolished churches eventually {{found their way into}} a number of temples in the area. After being informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> roundup by a friend in Tipu's government, Fr. Joachim Miranda disbanded St. Joseph's Seminary and sent the seminarians to Verapoly, from where some proceeded to Goa while some joined the Augustinian order.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with their}} first real competition, the Northern {{chartered}} their own North Grey Railway on 15 February 1871, with plans to extend out of Collingwood to Meaford and authority to continue to Owen Sound. Construction between Collingwood and Meaford took place over the flat terrain between the Niagara Escarpment and <b>the</b> southern shore <b>of</b> Georgian Bay, and the line was completed on 1 April 1872. However, the expansion to Owen Sound was never completed; a combination of much more difficult terrain west <b>of</b> Meaford, <b>the</b> <b>impending</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TG&B, and demand for other expansions that were considered more important.|$|R
2500|$|Ultimately, {{the film}} was {{considered}} a box office bomb, which Edward Jay Epstein of Slate blamed on poor publicity. Epstein notes that research polls showed little awareness <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Island's <b>impending</b> release amongst its target audience and that trailers bore little relation to the film's plot. He writes, [...] "What really failed here was not the directing, acting, or story (which were all acceptable for a summer movie) but the marketing campaign." ...|$|R
50|$|Chroma was a {{technically}} sophisticated skinning {{program by}} Thematic Software.
