30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been several reports of cutting guides used in {{genioplasty}} of the mandible [4, 6, 7]. These guides confer several advantages. First, the form and position of the osteotomy line can be adjusted in simulated surgery, which allows the osteotomy line to be preoperatively planned, minimizing the possibility of dental or neural damage. Moreover, using a cutting guide allows the surgeon to adjust the depth when cutting, leading to a non-invasive and stable osteotomy. <b>Cutting</b> <b>guides</b> also make orthognathic surgeries easier by allowing the bone segments to be moved to the planned positions, according to the design of the guide. In a recent multicenter study, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was used to measure the results of orthognathic surgeries using computer-aided surgical simulations (CASS) [9]. Significantly fewer errors were found for genioplasty when surgical guides were used, which led to more favorable surgical outcomes; the largest positional RMSD was 1.0  mm, and the largest orientation RMSD was 2.2 °. When a surgical guide was not used, the outcomes varied [9].|$|R

40|$|Background: Computer-aided {{design and}} {{computer-assisted}} manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of cutting guides {{are now being}} used in mandibular reconstruction with fibular bone flaps. Improvements in guide design and accuracy are needed to increase the benefits to patients. <b>Cutting</b> <b>guides</b> have become popular, but fixation guides are rarely considered. Materials and methods: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether using a fixation guide would contribute to better accuracy in mandibular reconstruction. Mandibular segmental osteotomies and fibular reconstructions were performed using model surgery. Models were divided into two groups: without or with a fixation guide (n =  13 for each group). After reconstruction, the distances between reference points such as the condylion laterale (Cl), gonion, and mental tubercle (T) were measured and compared with those of the preoperative virtual plan. Deviations in final positions between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The mean deviations were 2. 61  mm (range 0. 05 – 7. 65  mm) and 2. 05  mm (range 0. 07 – 8. 52  mm) in the groups without and with a fixation guide, respectively. The overall results were significantly better when a fixation guide was used (p =  0. 03). Distances including the Cl reference points such as ClCl (p =  0. 02) and Cl–T (p =  0. 001) were particularly improved. Conclusions: Using a fixation guide together with a cutting guide makes mandibular reconstruction more accurate, particularly for positioning the Cl reference points. Therefore, when a CAD/CAM-produced cutting guide is used in preparation for surgery, it is recommended to use a fixation guide as well for more accuracy...|$|R

The aim is to maximize the unit fleet availability over a multi-period planning horizon, while also ensuring that certain flight and maintenance requirements are satisfied. Heuristic approaches that are used in practice to solve the FMP problem often perform poorly, generating solutions that are far from the optimum. On the other hand, the exact optimization models that have been developed to tackle the problem handle small problems effectively, but tend to be computationally inefficient for larger problems, such as the ones that arise in practice. With these in mind, we develop an exact solution algorithm for the FMP problem, which is capable of identifying the optimal solution of considerably large realistic problems in reasonable computational times. The algorithm solves suitable relaxations of the original problem, utilizing valid <b>cuts</b> that <b>guide</b> the search towards the optimal solution. We present extensive experimental results, which demonstrate that the algorithm's performance on realistic problems is superior to that of two popular commercial optimization software packages, whereas the opposite is true for a class of problems with special characteristics that deviate considerably from those of realistic problems. The important conclusion of this research is that the proposed algorithm, complemented by generic optimization software, can handle effectively a large variety of FMP problem instances.

The first of those missions was concocted and attempted by five Wyalusing sailors on 26 May. They rowed up Middle River that afternoon carrying two 100-pound torpedoes, and then carried them by stretcher across the swampland separating the Middle and Roanoke Rivers to a point just above and opposite Albemarle&#39;s mooring place at Plymouth. Two of the sailors then swam across the river with a towline attached to the explosive devices and then hauled them across. The torpedoes were then joined together by a bridle, and one of the sailors guided them down toward the ram hoping to place the bridle across her prow with a torpedo making contact with either side of her hull. He was then to swim clear before another man stationed across the river detonated the torpedoes electrically.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the solution of}} variational inequalities (VIs) with analytic center cutting plane methods (ACCPMs). A convex feasibility problem reformulation of the variational inequality is used; this reformulation applies to VIs defined with pseudo-monotone, single-valued mappings or with maximal monotone, multi-valued mappings. Two cutting plane methods are presented: the first is based on linear cuts while the second uses quadratic cuts. The first method, ACCPM-VI (linear cuts), requires mapping evaluations but no Jacobian evaluations; in fact, no differentiability assumption is needed. The cuts are placed at approximate analytic centers that are tracked with infeasible primal-dual Newton steps. Linear equality constraints may {{be present in the}} definition of the VI's set of reference, and are treated explicitly. The set of reference is assumed to be polyhedral, or is convex and iteratively approximated by polyhedra. Alongside of the sequence of analytic centers, another sequence of points is generated, based on convex combinations of the analytic centers. This latter sequence is observed to converge to a solution much faster than the former sequence. The second method, ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), has cuts based on both mapping evaluations and Jacobian evaluations. The use of such a richer information set allows <b>cuts</b> that <b>guide</b> more accurately the sequence of analytic centers towards a solution. Mappings are assumed to be strongly monotone. However, Jacobian approximations, relying only on mapping evaluations, are observed to work very well in practice, so that differentiability of the mappings may not be required. There are two versions of the ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), that differ in the way a new analytic center is reached after the introduction of a cut. One version uses a curvilinear search followed by dual Newton centering steps. The search entails a full eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition of a dense matrix of the order of the number of variables. The other version uses two line searches, primal-dual Newton steps, but no eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition. The algorithms described in this thesis were implemented in the M ATLAB environment.

40|$|Abstract:Recent metaheuristics for mixed integer {{programming}} have included proposals for introducing inequalities and target objectives {{to guide the}} search. These guidance approaches are useful in intensification and diversification strategies related to fixing subsets of variables at particular values, and in strategies that use linear programming to generate trial solutions whose variables are induced to receive integer values. In Part I, we showed how to improve such approaches by new inequalities that dominate those previously proposed and by associated target objectives that underlie the creation of both inequalities and trial solutions. We also introduced procedures for generating target objectives and solutions by exploiting proximity in original space or projected space. In this Part II of this study, we review the fundamental concepts underlying weighted pseudo <b>cuts</b> for generating <b>guiding</b> inequalities, {{including the use of}} target objective strategies. Building on these foundations, we develop more advanced approaches for generating the target objective based on exploiting the mutually reinforcing notions of reaction and resistance. We additionally show how to generate new inequalities by “mining ” reference sets of elite solutions to extract characteristics these solutions exhibit in common. Model embedded memory, as proposed in parametric tabu search, is integrated to provide a range of recency and frequency memory structures for achieving goals associated with short term and long term solution strategies. Finally, we propose supplementary linear programming models that exploit the new inequalities for intensification and diversification, and introduce additional inequalities from sets of elite solutions that enlarge the scope of these models...|$|R

When, however, the levelled theodolite was directed to the distance, the reverse was found to be the case.

The want of refraction to lift the horizon, the astonishing precision of the outlines, and the brilliancy of the images of mountains reduced by distance to mere specks, are all circumstances tending to depress them to appearance. The absence of trees, houses, and familiar objects to assist the eye in the appreciation of distance, throws back the whole landscape; which, seen through the rarified atmosphere of 18,500 feet, looks as if diminished by being surveyed through the wrong end of a telescope.|$|R

The resulting forest represents the clusters found by a hierarchical clustering method that constructed the dendrogram, at the threshold α. 1 Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms: Divisive hierarchical clustering: these algorithms start by treating an entire dataset as a single cluster. On each step they find a way to split one of the currently observed clusters into a pair and construct the appropriate part of the dendrogram. Divisive clustering algorithms are top down. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering: these algorithms start by treating each point in the dataset as a single cluster. On each step, the algorithm makes a decision to merge two existing clusters, and constructs the apprpriate portion of the dendrogram. Agglomerative clustering algorithms are bottom up. We consider Agglomerative algorithms further...|$|R
40|$|Daylighting in {{tropical}} and sub-tropical climates presents a unique challenge that {{is generally not}} well understood by designers. In a sub-tropical region such as Brisbane, Australia {{the majority of the}} year comprises of sunny clear skies with few overcast days and as a consequence windows can easily become sources of overheating and glare. The main strategy in dealing with this issue is extensive shading on windows. However, this in turn prevents daylight penetration into buildings often causing an interior to appear gloomy and dark even though there is more than sufficient daylight available. As a result electric lighting is the main source of light, even during the day. Innovative daylight devices which redirect light from windows offer a potential solution to this issue. These devices can potentially improve daylighting in buildings by increasing the illumination within the environment decreasing the high contrast between the window and work regions and deflecting potentially glare causing sunlight away from the observer. However, the performance of such innovative daylighting devices are generally quantified under overcast skies (i. e. daylight factors) or skies without sun, which are typical of European climates and are misleading when considering these devices for tropical or sub-tropical climates. This study sought to compare four innovative window daylighting devices in RADIANCE; light shelves, laser <b>cut</b> panels, micro-light <b>guides</b> and light redirecting blinds. These devices were simulated in RADIANCE under sub-tropical skies (for Brisbane) within the test case of a typical CBD office space. For each device the quantity of light redirected and its distribution within the space was used as the basis for comparison. In addition, glare analysis on each device was conducted using Weinold and Christoffersons evalglare. The analysis was conducted for selected hours for a day in each season. The majority of buildings that humans will occupy in their lifetime are already constructed, and extensive remodelling of most of these buildings is unlikely. Therefore {{the most effective way to}} improve daylighting in the near future will be through the alteration existing window spaces. Thus it will be important to understand the performance of daylighting systems with respect to the climate it is to be used in. This type of analysis is important to determine the applicability of a daylighting strategy so that designers can achieve energy efficiency as well the health benefits of natural daylight...|$|R
