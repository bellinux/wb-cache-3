40|$|The <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of {{crystals}} of NaClO 3 and NaBrO 3 {{was measured}} in the visible and uv region of the spectrum. Apart from a small ir contribution, the <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> of both crystals can be expressed as a difference of 2 terms. For NaClO 3 the pos. term has a greater strength than the neg. one, whereas for NaBrO 3 the reverse is the case. Thus, corresponding configurations of the 2 crystals have opposite signs of optical rotation. Calcns. of optical activity in terms of at. refractivities but neglecting <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion,</b> such as those carried out recently for these 2 crystals, are necessarily inconclusive.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} of the circular dichroism and rotatory power of thin films of cholesteric liquid crystals. It {{is an extension}} of the treatment for infinitely thick specimens discussed in a previous paper. The therory predicts that the circular dichroism of a thin film plotted as a function of wave-length should exhibit a principal maximum accompanied by subsidiary maxima, and that the rotatory dispersin should be anomalous. Experimental circular dichroism and <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> curves are presented for cholesteric cinnamate, cholesteryl- 2 -propyn- 1 -yl carbonate and spectratherm.

40|$|As part of {{a general}} study of the {{time-dependent}} local density approximation (TDLDA), we here report calculations of optical activity of chiral molecules. The theory automatically satisfies sum rules and the Kramers-Kronig relation between circular dichroism and <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> power. We find that the theory describes the measured circular dichroism of the lowest states in methyloxirane with an accuracy of about a factor of two. In the chiral fullerene C_ 76 the TDLDA provides a consistent description of the optical absorption spectrum, the circular dichroism spectrum, and the <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> power, except for an overall shift of the theoretical spectrum.

50|$|In {{order for}} a {{molecule}} (or crystal) to exhibit circular birefringence and circular dichroism, it must be distinguishable from its mirror image. An object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image {{is said to be}} chiral, and <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism are known as chiroptical properties. Most biological molecules have one or more chiral centers and undergo enzyme-catalyzed transformations that either maintain or invert the chirality at {{one or more of these}} centers. Still other enzymes produce new chiral centers, always with a high specificity. These properties account for the fact that <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism are widely used in organic and inorganic chemistry and in biochemistry. In the absence of magnetic fields, only chiral substances exhibit <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> and circular dichroism. In a magnetic field, even substances that lack chirality rotate the plane of polarized light, as shown by Michael Faraday. Magnetic optical rotation is known as the Faraday effect, and its wavelength dependence is known as magnetic <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In regions of absorption, magnetic circular dichroism is observable.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of betaenone B was determined via {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (NMR), CD and <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) measurements. While it was also shown that betaenone B could be converted to betaenone A by oxidation by PCC followed by exposure to base, it wasn't until 1988 that a semi-complete total synthesis was reported. Using 1,3-butadiene as a starting material, a stereoselective synthesis of (+/-)-4-de(3'-hydroxypropionyl) betanenone B was achieved in a 24-step synthesis. Bioactivity of this synthetic product was not tested and no further work on total synthesis of betaenones has been published since.|$|E

An inversion of the principal Cotton effect and the dichroic band is observed below the acid pK.

50|$|CD {{is closely}} related to the <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) technique, and is {{generally}} considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform (Kramers-Kronig relation), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.|$|E
50|$|When {{white light}} {{passes through a}} polarizer, the extent of {{rotation}} of light depends on its wavelength. Short wavelengths are rotated more than longer wavelengths, per unit of distance. Because the wavelength of light determines its color, the variation of color with distance through the tube is observed. This dependence of specific rotation on wavelength is called <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In all materials the rotation varies with wavelength. The variation is caused by two quite different phenomena. The first accounts in most cases {{for the majority of}} the variation in rotation and should not strictly be termed rotatory dispersion. It depends on the fact that optical activity is actually circular birefringence. In other words, a substance which is optically active transmits right circularly polarized light with a different velocity from left circularly polarized light. In addition to this pseudodispersion which depends on the material thickness, there is a true rotatory dispersion which depends on the variation with wavelength of the indices of refraction for right and left circularly polarized light. For wavelengths that are absorbed by the optically active sample, the two circularly polarized components will be absorbed to differing extents. This unequal absorption is known as circular dichroism. Circular dichroism causes incident linearly polarized light to become elliptically polarized. The two phenomena are closely related, just as are ordinary absorption and dispersion. If the entire <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectrum is known, the circular dichroism spectrum can be calculated, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|As a {{graduate}} student at the physics laboratory of the École normale supérieure, he then prepared his doctoral thesis in physical sciences. In this thesis he studied the interactions of polarized light with optically active substances containing chiral molecules. In absorption bands of these substances, he found large variations of optical rotation as a function of wavelength, now known as <b>optical</b> <b>rotatory</b> <b>dispersion</b> (ORD) or as the Cotton effect.He also discovered the related phenomenon of circular dichroism, or unequal absorption of left and right circularly polarized light. These two phenomena were later used to determine the stereochemistries of chiral molecules in organic chemistry and in biochemistry.|$|E
