5|$|The bawarchis and rakabdars of Awadh {{gave birth}} to the dum style <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> or the art <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their spread {{consisted}} of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas. The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of New Orleans in 1718 {{marked the beginning}} of the French colony of Louisiana.

5|$|The human {{innovation}} <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> {{may have}} been particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants.

5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Israeli cuisine has adopted, and {{continues}} to adapt, elements of various styles of Jewish cuisine, particularly the Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles <b>of</b> <b>cooking.</b> It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Levantine, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, and foods such as falafel, hummus, msabbha, shakshouka, couscous, and za'atar are now widely popular in Israel.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{ventilated}} cooking fires, often {{fueled by}} coal or biomass fuels such as wood and dung, lead to {{indoor air pollution}} and {{are one of the}} most common causes of COPD in developing countries.

5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.

5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> and cleaning.|$|E

5|$|As India's {{national}} capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits {{of its residents}} and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents. The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi and lassi.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel {{is usually}} served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and {{sometimes}} {{as a side}} condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods {{during the last few}} minutes <b>of</b> <b>cooking.</b> It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|Cooking styles vary {{by region}} and each type <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> {{style and the}} {{ingredients}} used are generally based on the climate and location of the particular region and on traditions. Rice and variations of kibbee are common in the Galilee. The West Bank engages primarily in heavier meals involving the use of taboon bread, rice and meat and coastal plain inhabitants frequent fish, other seafood, and lentils. The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and skewered meats are served.|$|E
5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style <b>of</b> <b>cooking.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} to an emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) <b>of</b> <b>cooking</b> oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
