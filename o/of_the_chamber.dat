5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E

5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} on the stone walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> {{some of which were}} left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935.

Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} multi-party {{elections}} held {{after the start}} of Communist rule, there have been eight speakers of the parliament; the first five, executing the office until constitutional amendments in March 2001, were also speakers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies (since the parliament was bicameral at the time). As of 28 December 2015, Željko Reiner (HDZ) is the tenth Speaker of the Sabor.

5|$|The botched arrest {{attempt was}} {{politically}} disastrous for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> to arrest its members {{was considered a}} grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} Cristina Fernández de Kirchner {{was out of}} {{the country}} at the moment, and although she arranged an early return, she could not return to the country in time for the funeral.

His widow, former First Lady of Argentina María Lorenza Barreneche, was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health.|$|E

5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|After being {{vacated by}} the Keys, the {{building}} was purchased by 's Bank. Not long after acquiring the building, the bank removed the ceiling from the chamber, and added a large skylight to create a grand banking hall. The building was repainted in an expensive shade of blue which was fashionable at the time. In 1900, when 's Bank collapsed, {{the building was}} taken over by Parr's Bank. The render was stripped off the outside of the building sometime during the 1910s or 1920s, revealing the limestone underneath. In 1918, the bank became part of Westminster Bank. In the 1960s, the upper floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> was replaced. The building was presented to the Castletown Commissioners in 1973 by the National Westminster Bank on the condition that it serve the town. It was used as the Town Hall until the opening of the Town Hall and Civic Centre in 1989, and then as the Castletown Rural Library.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Pierlot {{joined the}} Catholic Party (Parti catholique), the main centre-right party in Belgium {{and one of}} the three that {{dominated}} Belgian political life. The Catholic Party, which was considered the party of stability and the establishment, was extremely electorally successful during the interwar period and headed a series of coalition governments. On 23 December 1925, Pierlot entered parliament as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies representing Neufchâteau-Virton but left just a week later to become a senator. He served as provincial senator for Luxembourg from 1926 to 1936 and as directly elected senator for the same province between 1936 and 1946. He received a reputation for his oratorical abilities and for personal sincerity during the late 1920s.|$|E
