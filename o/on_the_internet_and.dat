When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> the opportunity to collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{wanted to}} {{participate}} in the online-based entrepreneurial ventures which were increasingly popular and successful during the mid-1990s.

In his spare time after work at Chicago Options Associates, Wales constructed his own web browser.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in 2009 led to Church of Scientology-owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology. The Church of Scientology {{has long had}} a controversial history <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> <b>and</b> has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical of itself from the web. From early in Wikipedia's history, conflict arose within the topic of Scientology on the website. Disputes began in earnest in 2005, with users disagreeing {{about whether or not}} to describe Scientology as an abusive cult or religion. By 2006, disagreements concerning the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia had grown more specific. Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts.|$|E

Moxon had argued that Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> <b>and</b> his knowledge in the fields of cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the restraining order permanent.|$|E
5|$|Starting in April 2006, Bethesda {{released}} small {{packages of}} additional downloadable content (DLC) {{for the game}} from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. Oblivions final content pack was released October 15, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> at times through the courts.|$|E

5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. Contrary to popular belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>and</b> can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began with}} a Maryland kickoff to California, who were stopped for {{a net loss of}} 4yards and forced to punt. On Maryland's first possession, it mounted a 60-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard {{touchdown}} rush by Da'Rel Scott. California quarterback Kevin Riley then threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, which allowed Scott to rush for his second score of the game. California made a field goal, but on the following series, Maryland drove 60yards and tight end Dan Gronkowski made a touchdown reception. The Golden Bears made another field goal to end the first half with a score of 21–6, in Maryland's favor. During the second quarter, Riley threw a short screen pass to running back Jahvid Best, who immediately received a hard hit from Maryland cornerback Kevin Barnes. While still lying on the field, Best rolled to his side to vomit. Footage of the tackle and its aftermath circulated widely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>and</b> became a viral video phenomenon. In the third period, Chris Turner completed a pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 27-yard touchdown to end the quarter with Maryland in the lead, 28–6. In the final period, California scored two touchdowns against a preventative defense, before Maryland responded with a fifth score on a one-yard rush by Davin Meggett. In the final minutes, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 27-yard field goal which would have clinched the victory. Instead, California scored a third touchdown to close within eight points. With 1:55 remaining to play, California attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds, and Maryland was able to run out the clock to win the upset, 35–28.|$|E
