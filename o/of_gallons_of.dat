5|$|In February {{after one}} round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen {{due to their}} {{apparent}} intoxication and as a payback, the three pulled what {{was intended to be}} a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending hundreds of millions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> sewage into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor {{declared a state of}} emergency for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and millions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result}} of a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E

25|$|The BP {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico {{affected}} Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately.

25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination {{may be one of}} the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its scalability is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best.|$|E

On January 22, 1959, the ice-laden Susquehanna River broke through {{the roof of the}} River Slope Mine of the Knox Coal Company in nearby Port Griffith (in Jenkins Township). This allowed for billions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> river water to flood the interconnected mines.

25|$|Most tankers have an {{on-board}} pumping system. This pump {{is often}} not of sufficient power to fight fires (as {{it is designed to}} be attached to a fire engine), but is more often used to draw water into the tender from hydrants or other water sources. In some areas, the tenders are used to pump water during floods, and may be fitted with a heavier duty pump for this purpose. Many tankers are equipped with fast-drain valves on the sides and back of the truck. This allows firefighters to empty thousands <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water into a portable water tank in just a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|These {{industrial}} concerns, {{especially the}} manufactured gas plants(MGPs) that produced gas for gaslight and power, steam and electricity, poisoned {{the air and}} bay waters, the soil and the surrounding communities for decades, leaving behind huge quantities of hydrocarbons, sulphur, acids, powdered carbon, ash, slag, manganese, mercury, lead, copper, cadmium, zinc and other heavy metals. The facilities and their outdoor coal and lampblack stores, tar and fuel oil tanks polluted vast areas of bay mud, artificial fill and millions <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> fresh and salt water.
