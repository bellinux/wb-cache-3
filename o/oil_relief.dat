5000|$|For the Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{that began in}} April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, HeiQ, TWE Group and Beyond Surface Technologies jointly {{developed}} an oil-absorbing, water-repelling, nonwoven fabric, in the name Oilguard [...] for <b>oil</b> <b>relief</b> efforts. The product was intended for beach protection against oil spills and {{was applied to the}} shoreline. This allows for the fabric to absorb crude oil while repelling the seawater. This innovation was rewarded the Swiss Technology Award (2010) and the Swiss Award (2013). The water-repelling property of Oilguard is achieved with a textile finishing that creates the Lotus Effect {{on the surface of the}} non-woven fabric. The non-fluorinated finishing makes the fabric only water repellent but not oil repellent, therefore the fabric absorbs oil crudes but not the seawater.|$|E

He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen.

All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|R
30|$|Sesame oil {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} Taiwanese medicine to relieve the inflammatory pain in people with joint inflammation, toothache, scrapes, and cuts. However, scientific evidence related to the effectiveness or action mechanism of sesame <b>oil</b> on <b>relief</b> of pain and inflammation has not been examined experimentally. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of sesame oil on monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystal-induced acute inflammatory response in rats. Air pouch, a pseudosynovial cavity, was established by injecting 24  mL of filtered sterile air subcutaneously in the backs of the rats. At day 0, inflammation in air pouch was induced by injecting MSU crystal (5  mg/rat, suspended in sterilized phosphate buffered saline, pH  7.4), while sesame oil (0, 1, 2, or 4  mL/kg, orally) was given 6  h after MSU crystal injection. Parameters in lavage and skin tissue from the air pouches were assessed 6  h after sesame oil was given. Sesame oil decreased MSU crystal-induced total cell counts, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)- 1 β, and IL- 6 levels in lavage and pouch tissue. Sesame oil significantly decreased leukocyte and neutrophil counts in lavage compared with MSU crystal alone group. Sesame oil decreased activated mast cell counts in skin tissue in MSU crystal-treated rats. Sesame oil significantly decreased nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity and IL- 4 level in isolated mast cells from rats treated with MSU crystal. Furthermore, sesame oil decreased lavage complement proteins C 3 a and C 5 a levels in MSU crystal-treated rats. In conclusion, sesame oil shows a potent therapeutic effect against MSU crystal-induced acute inflammatory response in rats.|$|R

500|$|In the 1830s George Baxter repopularised colour relief printing, {{known as}} chromoxylography, {{by using a}} [...] "background detail plate printed in {{aquatint}} intaglio, followed by colours printed in <b>oil</b> inks from <b>relief</b> plates—usually wood blocks". [...] Evans followed the Baxter process, with the modification of using relief wood blocks only. For The Poems of Oliver Goldsmith, Evans created a facsimile of a watercolour, by superimposing colours {{with the use of}} separate colour blocks, one by one, to achieve the graduated colours of the original. First, Foster drew the illustration directly on the woodblocks that were to be cut, and he then recreated a coloured paper copy of the drawing. Evans, using the same pigments as Foster, grinding them himself, produced inks to match Foster's colours. The printing was done using a hand-press, with nine or ten print runs required for each illustration. For A Chronicle of England, Evans engraved prints dropped into the text at six-page intervals. Doyle drew the illustrations directly onto the wood blocks and created coloured proofs. Nine or ten wood blocks (colour blocks) were used for each of the 80illustrations, which Evans again printed on a hand-press. The use of colour and the ability to create subtle tones are characteristic of Evans' skill as a colourist. His work was distinctive because of the characteristic quality of the wood engraving (carving) and his manner of limiting the use of ink to create a more striking result.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} external gear pumps for automotive applications, which operate at high speed and low pressure. In previous works of the authors, a hybrid lumped-parameter/finite-element model has been developed, in order to foresee the pump dynamic behaviour in terms of gear and casing acceleration. The model includes the main important phenomena involved in the pump operation {{and it has been}} validated on the basis of experimental data. In this research, an original optimization process has been applied to such a hybrid model {{in order to reduce the}} pump vibration level, i. e. the acceleration of the external casing. The set up of the optimization process comprises a single objective (case accelerations) and some operational and geometrical input variables (oil viscosity, <b>oil</b> Bulk modulus, <b>relief</b> groove dimension and radial clearance in the journal bearings). This paper compares three optimization methodologies for the optimization of the pump vibration level. In particular common optimization processes based on simulations are compared with a combined analysis based, firstly, on Design Of Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Modelling (RSM) and, secondly, on the application of evolutionary algorithms to reach the optimal variable combination. The different methodologies are compared in terms of time efficiency and accuracy in the solution. Finally, a robust design process has been carried out in order to consider the manufacturing tolerances of the real pump and assess their effect on the performance of the component. The results offer important information and design insights that would be very difficult to obtain without such procedures...|$|R
40|$|Program: Petroleum 6. B Depth Conversion and Interpretation (6 B 1 A) Deciding on {{the most}} {{accurate}} grid based depth conversion method can often be an arbitrary choice made by geophysicists, particularly if previous research is limited. The importance of accurate depth conversion is particularly crucial in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin, where the presence of <b>oil</b> rich, low <b>relief</b> structural traps are questionable depending on the method used. Previous depth conversion studies are limited to local scales, limited well control and a focus on select horizons. To investigate the depth conversion uncertainty on a regional scale, this research performs a comprehensive and regionally extensive depth conversion analysis utilising 13 3 D seismic surveys with 73 interpreted TWT grids and 657 wells. Depth conversions were performed using the 4 most commonly used methods; average (pseudo) velocity, time-depth trend, kriging with external drift using TWT, and kriging with external drift to tie stacking velocities to average well velocities. To manage the large volume of data, a looping script was written to automate the depth conversion process and utilise the cross-validation, or blind-well method (use n wells to predict the n^th + 1 well). Statistics on several variables were captured after each loop, with cluster analysis performed on the final data set to test variable significance on depth conversion accuracy. A database of approximately 10000 error calculations found that although the average velocity method is the most accurate {{at a high level}} (average absolute error ~ 24. 9 feet), the best method and the expected error changes significantly (tens of feet) depending on the combination and value of the most significant variables. The variables which impacted uncertainty the most were; location (3 D survey), formation, distance to the nearest well, and the spatial location of the predicted well relative to the existing well data envelope.
