For example, climatological or simple specifications of time-varying ozone concentrations are imposed and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of equatorial stratospheric zonal wind is absent. Here we investigate the impact of an improved stratospheric representation using two sets of perturbed simulations with the Hadley Centre coupled ocean atmosphere model HadGEM 1 with natural and anthropogenic forcings for the 1979 – 2003 period. In {{the first set of}} simulations, the usual zonal mean ozone climatology with superimposed trends is replaced with a time series of observed zonal mean ozone distributions that includes interannual variability associated with the solar cycle, QBO and volcanic eruptions. In addition to this, the second set of perturbed simulations includes a scheme in which the stratospheric zonal wind in the tropics is relaxed to appropriate zonal mean values obtained from the ERA- 40 re-analysis, thus forcing a QBO. Both of these changes are applied strictly to the stratosphere only. The improved <b>ozone</b> <b>field</b> results in an improved simulation of the stepwise temperature transitions observed in the lower stratosphere {{in the aftermath of the}} two major recent volcanic eruptions. The contribution of the solar cycle signal in the <b>ozone</b> <b>field</b> to this improved representation of the stepwise cooling is discussed. The improved <b>ozone</b> <b>field</b> and also the QBO result in an improved simulation of observed trends, both globally and at tropical latitudes. The Eulerian upwelling in the lower stratosphere in the equatorial region is enhanced by the improved <b>ozone</b> <b>field</b> and is affected by the QBO relaxation, yet neither induces a significant change in the upwelling trend. ...|$|E

Ozone in the lower stratosphere is captured better: mean state, vertical gradients, spatial and temporal variability are all improved. Inclusion of OMI and MLS data together, or separately, in the assimilation system provides a way of checking how consistent OMI and MLS data are with each other, and with the ozone model. We found that differences between OMI total ozone column data and model forecasts decrease after MLS data are assimilated. This indicates that MLS stratospheric ozone profiles are consistent with OMI total ozone columns. The evaluation of error characteristics of OMI and MLS ozone will continue as data from newer versions of retrievals becomes available.

The shape of the annual-mean vertical profile of the assimilated <b>ozone</b> <b>fields</b> is sensitive to the meteorological analyses, with the GEOS- 4 -based ozone being closest to the observations.

The change in ozone within each regime for the period January 1979 –May 1991, a period of rapid total ozone change, was studied in detail.

Profiles of chemically inert nitrous oxide (N(2) O) {{are used to}} trace vertical transport during the winter. Two methods are used for estimating the vortex average ozone losses north of 67 degrees equivalent latitude. In a first step, the time evolution of ozone mixing ratios is described on N(2) O isopleths. Maximum ozone depletion is found on the 100 ppbv and 150 ppbv N(2) O isopleths (located in the 430 - 460 K potential temperature range in mid-March 2005) where vortex average ozone depletion totalled 1. 0 - 1. 1 ppmv for Aura/MLS and 0. 7 - 0. 9 ppmv for Odin/SMR. Second, ozone profiles from Aura/MLS and Odin/SMR are assimilated into the DIAMOND isentropic transport model. Ozone depletion is estimated by comparing assimilated <b>fields</b> to <b>ozone</b> <b>fields</b> passively transported from 1 January.

We illustrate these diverse applications by a series of examples using the ozone assimilation system at NASA/Goddard. In a case study, low ozone in the lower stratosphere due to transport of air from the Tropics to northern high latitudes that was captured by assimilation of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) data, was found to agree with SAGE III data.

Assimilation of POAM data was shown to improve the representation of lower stratospheric ozone, especially over Antarctica. More recently, we assimilated ILAS II ozone data in order to help in their validation.

An uncoupled version using an ozone climatology for determining heating rates and a coupled version using on-line ozone are compared in a 10 -month integration with meteorological analyses for the winter 1992 / 93 as the lower boundary condition. Both versions simulate the meteorological situation satisfactorily, but exhibit a too cold lower stratosphere. The on-line ozone differs from the climatological data between 20 and 40 km by exhibiting too high ozone values, whereas in the lower mesosphere the ozone values are too low. The coupled model version is stable and differs only above 40 km significantly from the uncoupled version. Direct heating effects are identified to cause most of the differences. The well-known negative correlation between temperature and ozone is reproduced in the model. As a result, the coupled version slightly approaches the climatological <b>ozone</b> <b>field.</b> Further feedback effects are studied by using the on-line <b>ozone</b> <b>field</b> as a basis for an artificial climatology. For non-disturbed ozone conditions realistic monthly and zonally averaged ozone data are sufficient to determine the heating rates for modelling the middle atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|It is {{expected}} from theoretical considerations that synoptic-scale variations in total ozone should {{be correlated with}} the absolute vorticity field near the tropopause. This paper tests the theory, using TOMS total <b>ozone</b> <b>fields</b> and vorticity derived from ECMWF analyses. A good correlation is found, except during winter - suggesting that other sources of variability in total ozone are active at this time. The correlation with potential vorticity is also investigated. This shows two maxima in the correlation coefficient in winter and spring, one near the tropopause {{and the other in}} the region of 420 K. A study of the residuals from a linear regression of vorticity with total ozone during January reveals a similar structure to the 450 K potential vorticity field...|$|R
40|$|The Data Assimilation Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center {{provides}} global 3 D <b>ozone</b> <b>fields</b> at six-hour time intervals. Data from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument {{are used}} in the assimilation. TOMS provides total column information and SBUV provides profile information, primarily above the ozone peak. Information below the ozone peak comes from the model. This paper will explore the realism of the assimilated ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere through validation with ozonesondes, Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), and Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) observations. This work is in preparation of using the assimilated ozone in the radiative calculation for the meteorological assimilation {{as well as in the}} derivation of tropospheric ozone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A three-level nested {{regional}} {{air pollution}} {{model has been}} used to study the processes leading to high ozone concentrations in the southern Great Lakes region of North America. The highest resolution simulations show that com-plex interactions between the lake-breeze circulation and the synoptic flow lead to significant enhancements in the pho-tochemical production and transport of ozone at the local scale. Mass tracking of individual model processes show that Lakes Erie and St. Clair frequently act as photochemi-cal ozone production regions, with average mid-day produc-tion rates of up to 3 ppbv per hour. Enhanced ozone levels are evident over these two lakes in 23 -day-average surface <b>ozone</b> <b>fields.</b> Analysis of other model fields and aircraft mea-surements suggests that vertical circulation enhances ozone levels at altitudes up to 1500 m over Lake St. Clair, wherea...|$|R
