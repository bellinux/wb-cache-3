IFDMA provides less power fluctuation and thus requires energy-inefficient linear amplifiers. Similarly, MC-CDMA is in the proposal for the IEEE 802.20 standard.

Applications of spectrum-sensing cognitive radio include emergency-network and WLAN higher throughput and transmission-distance extensions. The evolution of cognitive radio toward cognitive networks is underway; the concept of cognitive networks is to intelligently organize a network of cognitive radios.|$|E

50|$|A related {{technique}} is called Uplink Collaborative MIMO, where users transmit {{at the same}} time in the same frequency. This type of spatial multiplexing improves the sector throughput without requiring multiple transmit antennas at the mobile device. The common non-MIMO method for this in <b>OFDMA</b> is by scheduling different mobile stations at different points in an <b>OFDMA</b> time-frequency map. Collaborative Spatial Multiplexing (Collaborative MIMO) is comparable to regular spatial multiplexing, where multiple data streams are transmitted from multiple antennas on the same device.|$|E
5000|$|<b>OFDMA,</b> an {{alternative}} multiple access scheme for OFDM systems, where the signals of different users are separated {{in the frequency}} domain by allocating different sub-carriers to different users.|$|E
5000|$|... eNB {{uses the}} E-UTRA {{protocols}} <b>OFDMA</b> (downlink) and SC-FDMA (uplink) on its LTE-Uu interface. By contrast, NodeB uses the UTRA protocols WCDMA or TD-SCDMA on its Uu interface.|$|E
50|$|<b>OFDMA</b> is {{considered}} as highly suitable for broadband wireless networks, due to advantages including scalability {{and use of}} multiple antennas (MIMO)-friendliness, and ability {{to take advantage of}} channel frequency selectivity.|$|E
50|$|To {{distinguish}} {{signals from}} several different transmitters, time {{division multiple access}} (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA), and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (<b>OFDMA)</b> were developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>OFDMA</b> {{is also a}} {{candidate}} access method for the IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN). The project aims at designing the first cognitive radio based standard operating in the VHF-low UHF spectrum (TV spectrum).|$|E
5000|$|DOCSIS 3.1 {{supports}} a downstream throughput with 4096-QAM and 25 kHz subcarrier spacing {{of up to}} 1.89 Gbit/s per 192 MHz OFDM channel. The upstream throughput possible is 0.94 Gbit/s per 96 MHz <b>OFDMA</b> channel.|$|E
50|$|However, spread {{spectrum}} gives lower spectral efficiency than non-{{spread spectrum}} techniques, if the channel allocation {{in the latter}} case is optimized by a good DCA scheme. Especially OFDM modulation is an interesting alternative to spread spectrum because of its ability to combat multipath propagation for wideband channels without complex equalization. OFDM can be extended with <b>OFDMA</b> for uplink multiple access among users in the same cell. For avoidance of inter-cell interference, FDMA with DCA or DFS is once again of interest. One example of this concept is the above mentioned IEEE 802.11h standard. OFDM and <b>OFDMA</b> with DCA is often studied as an alternative for 4G wireless systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>OFDMA</b> {{can also}} be {{described}} as a combination of frequency-domain and time-domain multiple access, where the resources are partitioned in the time-frequency space, and slots are assigned along the OFDM symbol index, as well as OFDM sub-carrier index.|$|E
50|$|CDMA is not {{expected}} to be used in 4G systems, and is not used in pre-4G systems such as LTE and WiMAX, but is about to be supplemented by more spectral efficient frequency-domain equalization (FDE) techniques such as <b>OFDMA.</b>|$|E
50|$|The CDMA spread {{spectrum}} radio technology used in 3G systems and IS-95 is abandoned {{and replaced by}} <b>OFDMA</b> and other frequency-domain equalization schemes. This is combined with MIMO (Multiple In Multiple Out), antenna arrays, dynamic channel allocation and channel-dependent scheduling.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of SC-FDMA {{in relation to}} <b>OFDMA</b> {{has been the subject}} of various studies. Although the performance gap is small, SC-FDMA's advantage of low PAPR makes it desirable for uplink wireless transmission in mobile communication systems, where transmitter power efficiency is of paramount importance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>OFDMA</b> {{can be seen}} as an {{alternative}} to combining OFDM with time-division multiple access (TDMA) or time-domain statistical multiplexing communication. Low-data-rate users can send continuously with low transmission power instead of using a [...] "pulsed" [...] high-power carrier. Constant delay, and shorter delay, can be achieved.|$|E
