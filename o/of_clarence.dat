5|$|New York State Route268 (NY268) was a {{state highway}} in northeastern Erie County, New York, in the United States. It served as a {{connector}} between NY5 in the town <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and NY78 at the Clarence–Amherst town line. The route passed through rural areas of the town <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and did not serve any areas of significant development. The northern portion of NY268 followed the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1477, Ankarette Twynyho {{was taken}} from the manor house that stands, known locally as the Old Nunnery, in Lower Keyford accused by George Plantagenet, 1st Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> of the murder of Isabel Neville, Duchess <b>of</b> <b>Clarence.</b> She was {{subsequently}} tried and hanged. Ankarette's grandson Roger Twynyho received from Edward IV a full retrospective pardon for Ankarette, and the petition he submitted to the king in 1478 describes fully the circumstances of the case, well illustrating the quasi-kingly high-handedness <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> which was ultimately not tolerated by the king.|$|E

5|$|Mayfair {{has many}} blue plaques on buildings, {{due to the}} {{proliferation}} of important and recognised residents. Standing {{at the corner of}} Chesterfield Street and Charles Street, one can see plaques for William, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and St Andrews (later King William IV), Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, the writer Somerset Maughan and Regency-era fashion icon Beau Brummell.|$|E

5|$|Warwick had no sons. The elder {{of his two}} {{daughter}}s, Isabel, married George, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence.</b> His {{younger daughter}} Anne had a short-lived marriage to King Henry's son Edward of Westminster, who died in battle {{at the age of}} 17. She then married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{offices were}} divided between King Edward's {{brothers}} George, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> (who had married Warwick's daughter Isabel Neville), and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III (who would marry Warwick's daughter Anne Neville). Clarence received the chamberlainship of England and the lieutenancy of Ireland, while Gloucester was made Admiral of England and Warden of the West March. Clarence also received the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury. The earl's land had been forfeited and {{taken into the}} king's custody. When Gloucester married Warwick's younger daughter Anne in 1472, who had been recently widowed {{by the death of}} Prince Edward, a dispute broke out between the two princes over the Beauchamp and Despenser inheritances. A compromise was eventually reached, whereby the land was divided, but Clarence was not pacified. In 1477 he once again plotted against his brother. This time the king could no longer act with lenience, and the next year the Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> was executed.|$|E
5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the Duke of York; William, the Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, Clarence and Beeby, {{together}} with some <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> university students, {{set up a}} free play centre five mornings a week, {{with the goal of}} observing the behaviour of 5-year-old children for Clarence's research.|$|R
5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to Queen Victoria's fondness for her, {{as well as to}} her strong {{character}} and sense of duty. However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in a recurrence of the worldwide 1889–90 influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Knight {{presented}} an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family, freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert. He {{concluded that the}} victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and Avondale, and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press {{that it was a}} hoax. Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book's conclusion is now widely discredited.|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 in the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> {{in the town}} of the same name. It headed north, following Salt Road out of the hamlet and into a mostly rural area of northeastern Erie County. Here, the route intersected with several east–west highways of local importance and passed by Beeman Creek Park before meeting Tonawanda Creek Road at a junction on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek. The highway turned west at this junction, following Tonawanda Creek Road {{along the edge of the}} creek to the Clarence–Amherst town line, where NY268 ended at a junction with NY78 in the hamlet of Millersport.|$|E
6000|$|Somehow I {{had never}} thought of Martyn. He had simply seemed to me a boy, and I had decided that Anne would be the crown <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> labours. I {{answered}} 'Nonsense; they are both children together!' ...|$|R
50|$|Woombah {{is located}} on the North Arm <b>of</b> the <b>Clarence</b> River (New South Wales). The Clarence River is popular for fishing. The North Arm <b>of</b> the <b>Clarence</b> river {{includes}} Flathead (fish), Whiting (fish), bream and mud crabs.|$|R
60|$|A {{slight smile}} {{passed over the}} face <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> neighbors. The bonnetless woman nodded a {{pleasant}} acknowledgment, and coquettishly wound the vine in her glossy hair. The dark man at his side, who hadn't spoken yet, turned to Clarence dryly.|$|R
5|$|NY78 and Transit Road remain four lanes, passing several {{commercial}} {{businesses and}} entering an intersection with NY33 (Genesee Street) and crossing over Ellicott Creek. The route crosses over a former railroad grade, soon intersecting with CR324 (Aero Drive). Just after CR324, NY78 and Transit Road enter an intersection with the feeder roads to exit49 of the New York State Thruway (I-90). NY78 and Transit Road continue {{into the town}} <b>of</b> <b>Clarence.</b> After crossing Wehrle Drive (CR290 and CR275), the four-lane boulevard crosses into the town of Amherst.|$|E
5|$|Once {{leaving the}} city of Buffalo, NY5 heads east through the densely {{populated}} suburban town of Amherst, including the hamlets of Snyder and Eggertsville and the village of Williamsville and is heavily developed through {{the entire length of}} the town, particularly at the intersection with Transit Road (NY78). In the town <b>of</b> <b>Clarence,</b> the road dips into a significant depression known as Clarence Hollow. Once leaving Clarence, NY5 goes through predominantly rural areas until reaching {{the city of}} Batavia in Genesee County, closely paralleling the New York State Thruway through much of the county. The road travels eastward until reaching Livingston County and the village of Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|Prince Albert Victor, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence</b> and Avondale (Albert Victor Christian Edward; 8 January 1864 – 14 January 1892), was {{the eldest}} {{child of the}} Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) and {{grandson}} of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria. From {{the time of his}} birth, he was second in the line of succession to the British throne, but never became king: he died before his father and his grandmother, the Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Softly, my son! It {{was not of}} HIM I speak, but of {{something}} more terrible and awful. Were you not afraid of--of--" [...] he paused, and suddenly darting his clear eyes into the very depths <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> soul, added--"of YOURSELF?" ...|$|R
50|$|Metro Tasmania only operate {{passenger}} buses from the transit Mall. However the routes operating from {{or through the}} transit mall not only access almost all <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> suburbs, but also provide access to Greater Hobart's other cities of Glenorchy and Hobart itself.|$|R
60|$|Peyton made a hurried {{gesture of}} warning, as if {{reminding}} the speaker <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> presence--a gesture which the boy noticed and wondered at. Then the conversation {{of the three}} men took a lower tone, although Clarence distinctly heard the concluding opinion of the expert.|$|R
5|$|The King {{was buried}} in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 15 July. His only {{legitimate}} child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, had died from post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son. The second son of George III, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, had died childless in 1827, so the succession passed to the third son of George III, Prince William, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Clarence,</b> who reigned as William IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY268 date {{as far back}} as 1926, by which time the state of New York had assumed {{maintenance}} of several highways in the town <b>of</b> <b>Clarence.</b> The farthest north of these was Tonawanda Creek Road, which was state-maintained from Transit Road (NY78) in Millersport to Salt Road. From here, state maintenance continued south on Salt Road to a junction with Main Street (what is now NY5). Also state-maintained by this time was Goodrich Road, a north–south road connecting Tonawanda Creek Road to Main Street (modern NY5), and Wolcott Road, an east–west highway linking Goodrich Road to Transit Road (what is now NY78).|$|E
5|$|When NY324 was {{assigned}} , it began at NY384 (River Road; now NY266) {{in the town}} of Tonawanda and followed Sheridan Drive eastward to NY5 in the town <b>of</b> <b>Clarence.</b> By 1935, what is now NY324 between Niagara Falls and Tonawanda via Grand Island was designated as NY325. NY324 was extended northward to NY384 in Niagara Falls , supplanting the entirety of NY325. The NY325 designation was reassigned to the short piece of Sheridan Drive not designated as NY324. The route was extended one final time by 1948 to follow NY384 westward from the North Grand Island Bridge into downtown Niagara Falls.|$|E
50|$|It was {{restored}} to two <b>of</b> George <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> children: {{to his son}} Edward in 1485 until his execution for treason in 1499, and to Edward's sister, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, in 1513 until she was also executed, and the title again forfeited, in 1539.|$|R
5000|$|Richard informs Edward <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> {{death at}} a meeting with Prime Minister Lord Hastings, and the King dies from a stroke. As Edward's sons are underage, Richard becomes Regent, taking the title of Lord Protector {{with the support of}} the ambitious and corrupt Duke of Buckingham.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote I: There was {{a strange}} story in respect to the manner <b>of</b> <b>Clarence's</b> death, which was very current at the time, namely, that he was drowned by his {{brothers}} in a butt of Malmsey wine. But {{there is no evidence}} whatever that this story was true.] ...|$|R
