Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 2007, an SBS team {{killed the}} Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah after JSOC and the ISA tracked {{him to a}} {{compound}} - where his associates were meeting - near Bahram Chah, Helmand province. The ISA confirmed he was there and an SBS reconnaissance element carried out reconnaissance of the compound which showed that Dadullah was protected 20 insurgents. That night, with the ISA monitoring the target, the majority of C Squadron were inserted by RAF CH-47D Chinooks whilst covered by Apache helicopters, the troops stormed the compound and a one hour long firefight took place as small groups of Taliban were hunted down and killed. 4 SBS personnel were wounded (one seriously), eventually Dadullah {{was shot in the}} chest and head, quick SSE was conducted and before the assault force was picked up by helicopter. On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah, they had been kidnapped 2 days before. Col Moschin parachuted onto a drop zone and marched overnight to surround the target compound, whilst the SBS were standing by in Lynx and Chinook helicopters to provide cut off groups in-case the insurgents attempted to escape, whilst a US Predator drone supported the British and Italians. The insurgents brought the hostages out of the compound and loaded them into vehicles before the Italians were in position to rescue them, the SBS closed in on the vehicles: aerial snipers using M82A1 antimaterial rifles forced the vehicles to stop. A Chinook dropped <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a dozen SBS personnel who engaged the Taliban who were disembarking the vehicles, 8 Taliban insurgents were killed and the hostages were rescued, however one died of gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|The next USEE {{match at}} Leeds Holbeck {{followed}} the second Gentlemen v Players fixture and began on Thursday, 11 July. The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole teetotaller in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted {{players in the}} USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he could chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs.|$|E

25|$|Snorri Sturluson {{starts his}} epic {{history of the}} kings of Norway with Ynglinga saga, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods.

25|$|China {{could not}} afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the {{education}} of a few students. Since 1978 China's leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party's principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China's leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to siphon <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> its share of funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.|$|E
25|$|The RN {{was thus}} faced with {{designing}} a carrier {{that would be}} survivable under the conditions to be expected in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Oceans, and before the development of effective naval radar; these conflicting demands resulted {{in the development of}} aircraft carriers whose decks were armoured against 500lb Armour Piercing bombs and 1000lb General Purpose bombs. The RN considered that an unarmoured carrier would be unlikely to be able fly <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one deck load of strike aircraft prior to being attacked so the armoured flight deck carriers accepted a reduction in hangar capacity to the equivalent to one deck load of aircraft. USN, IJN some RN Fleet carriers such as Ark Royal had sufficient aircraft capacity to allow for two ranges, each equal to a full deck load of strike aircraft. The RN and IJN limited their aircraft carrier's aircraft capacity to the capacity of their hangars, and struck down all aircraft between operations. The USN, typically, used a permanent deck park to augment the capacity of their aircraft carrier's hangars. The use of a permanent deck park appeared to give USN carriers a much larger aircraft capacity than contemporary RN armoured flight deck carriers. The flight deck armour also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armoured flight deck carrier, however the largest part of the disparity between RN and USN carriers in aircraft capacity was due to the use of a permanent deck park on USN carriers.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} ships were being pummeled. Weehawken had {{advanced}} {{to a line}} of buoys that Captain Rodgers thought might mark torpedoes, so he swerved from the channel and stopped to consider what to do next. At this time, an underwater explosion rocked the vessel; Rodgers {{thought that it was}} a torpedo, but some historians believe that it was more likely the explosion of a shell from one of the forts. In either case, the ship suffered no significant injury. Because she had left the channel, however, the line of ships following her were thrown into confusion, and whatever was left of Du Pont's battle plan collapsed. The intense fire the ships received from the forts kept them farther from Fort Sumter than the admiral had envisioned, so their return fire was less accurate than planned. It was not accuracy that determined the result, however, but the sheer disparity in firepower. In the course of the two hours of the engagement, the Confederate forces got <b>off</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2000 shot and shell, of which 520 hit. By contrast, the Union fleet fired only 154 shots. Their armor protected the crews, but several ships suffered damage that impaired their fighting abilities, such as jammed turrets and gunport stoppers. Worst hit was Keokuk, which was hit 90 times, including 19 shots at or below the waterline. Captain Rhind withdrew his ship from the fight, barely able to keep her afloat until she was beyond enemy gunfire. By this time, the tide had turned, so Admiral Du Pont decided to suspend the attack until the following day.|$|E
