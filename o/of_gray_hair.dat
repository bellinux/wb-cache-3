5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b> This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} smoking, chewing tobacco (gutka), and age <b>of</b> individual on <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 120 patients attending the Outpatient Department of the DJ College of Dental Sciences and Research, Modinagar, UP. The individuals were classified into four groups (group I, II, III, IV) {{on the basis of}} the form of tobacco use (smoking or chewing). The Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to find the correlation between the mean percentage <b>of</b> individuals with <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> risk multiplication factor (RMF), and age of the individual. Results: Mean percentage <b>of</b> individual with <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> and RMF (r = 0. 6487) are found to be positively associated. A significant and positive correlation was observed between the age of the individual and the frequency <b>of</b> individuals with <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b> Conclusion: This study suggests that there is a significant association between tobacco use and aging on <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> as a risk marker {{among young}} smokers has a {{potential}} of identifying {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) {{at a very early}} stage. There is absence of literature that assesses premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> as an independent marker of CAD in smokers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present single-centre case control study enrolled a total of 62 consecutive chronic smokers (≤ 45 years) (Group I) and 60 consecutive young CAD patients (≤ 45 years) who were chronic smokers (Group II). Another group comprising of 114 patients (≤ 45 years) having no smoking history and no cardiac ailments either (Group III) was enrolled as control population. All subjects were males. A detailed history and clinical examination regarding conventional coronary risk factors and carotid intima media thickness was done in both groups. RESULTS: The carotid intima media thickness, dyslipidemia and blood pressure were significantly higher in group I and II as compared to group III. When the groups were compared for <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> {{it was found that the}} group II (i. e., smokers and CAD) had maximum prevalence <b>of</b> <b>graying</b> which was significantly higher than the control as well as smoker groups. The presence <b>of</b> premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> was associated with 3. 24 times the risk of CAD on multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The presence <b>of</b> premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> was associated with an increased risk of CAD in young smokers. Premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> can be used as preliminary evidence by clinicians for classifying patients at risk for premature CAD especially in smokers...|$|R
60|$|The {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> {{on a young}} head, had perplexed and confounded this Blunt to such {{a degree}} that he at last came to the conclusion it must be the result of the black art, wrought upon him by an enemy; and that enemy, he opined, was an old sailor landlord in Marseilles, whom he had once seriously offended, by knocking him down in a fray.|$|R

50|$|Different breeds, and {{individuals}} within each breed, take differing amounts <b>of</b> time to <b>gray</b> out. Thus, graying {{cannot be used}} to approximate the age of a horse except in the broadest of terms: a very young horse will never have a white coat (unless it is a true white horse), while a horse in its teens usually is completely grayed out. One must also {{be careful not to}} confuse the small amount <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> that may appear on some older horses in their late teens or twenties, which do not reflect the gray gene and never cause a complete <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> the horse.|$|R
60|$|Presently Nettlewick {{was aware}} of a big man towering above him at his elbow--a man sixty years of age, rugged and hale, with a rough, grizzled beard, a mass <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> {{and a pair of}} {{penetrating}} blue eyes that confronted the formidable glasses of the examiner without a flicker.|$|E
60|$|Chris Dorn sat in {{the light}} of the kitchen lamps. He was a huge man with a great, round, bullet-shaped head and a shock <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> and bristling, grizzled beard.

60|$|It was not needful {{to travel}} much farther. Under a bush well {{hidden in a}} clump of trees lay what now {{remained}} of my deer. A patch <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> a few long bones, a split skull, and two long ears--no more! Even the hide was gone. Perhaps the coyotes had finished the job after the lion had gorged himself, but I did not think so. It {{seemed to me that}} coyotes would have scattered the remains. Those two long ears somehow seemed pathetic. I wished for a second that the lion were in range of my rifle.|$|E

50|$|Coloring <b>hair</b> <b>gray</b> often {{requires}} {{the use of}} dyeing as well as bleaching the hair and both the practices are damaging {{to the health of the}} hair. To achieve the look prior to naturally <b>graying,</b> <b>hair</b> must first bleached until it's white. Then tones <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> blue or violet are added. If the color isn't made light enough, the hair will take on a green tone instead <b>of</b> <b>gray.</b> Maintaining the look <b>of</b> artificially <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> requires a lot of maintenance to avoid regrowth. Frequent toning is required since silver and grey hair can look blond after a few weeks.|$|R

60|$|And--having {{nothing better}} to employ me then--I {{presently}} went raging to old Pettigrew {{in order to put}} the whole thing before him in what I considered the proper light. Old Pettigrew evaded my illumination; he saw me coming up his front steps--I can still see his queer old nose and the crinkled brow over his eye and the little wisp <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> that showed over the corner of his window-blind--and he instructed his servant to put up the chain when she answered the door, and to tell me that he would not see me. So I had to fall back upon my pen.|$|E
60|$|This {{afternoon}} I {{had taken}} up the fourth volume of Jerdan's Autobiography,--wretched twaddle, though it records such constant and apparently intimate intercourse with distinguished people,--and was reading it, between asleep and awake, on the sofa, when Mr. Jerdan himself was announced. I saw him, in company with Mr. Bennoch, nearly three years ago, at Rock Park, and wondered then what there was in so uncouth an individual to get him so freely into polished society. He now looks rougher than ever,--time-worn, but not reverend; a thatch <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> on his head; an imperfect set of false teeth; a careless apparel, checked trousers, and a stick, for he had walked {{a mile or two}} from his own dwelling.|$|E
60|$|He {{resumed his}} walk, {{and was glad}} to {{perceive}} that the street now became wider, and the houses more respectable in their appearance. He soon discerned a figure moving on moderately in advance, and hastened his steps to overtake it. As Robin drew nigh, {{he saw that the}} passenger was a man in years, with a full periwig <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> a wide-skirted coat of dark cloth, and silk stockings rolled above his knees. He carried a long and polished cane, which he struck down perpendicularly before him at every step; and at regular intervals he uttered two successive hems, of a peculiarly solemn and sepulchral intonation. Having made these observations, Robin laid hold of the skirt of the old man's coat just when the light from the open door and windows of a barber's shop fell upon both their figures.|$|E

60|$|A few minutes' walk {{brought him}} to the banks of a little brook, by the side of which, on the {{projecting}} root of a tree, sat a man, with a dead goose at his feet and a fowling-piece by his side. He was dressed in the garb of a hunter; and, from the number <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> that shone like threads of silver among the black curls on his temples, he was evidently past the meridian of life--although, from the upright bearing of his tall, muscular frame, and the quick glance of his fearless black eye, it was equally evident that the vigour of his youth was not yet abated.|$|R
60|$|On the {{staircase}} I met Miss Meadowcroft ascending {{to her own}} room. Not a curl <b>of</b> her stiff <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> was disarranged; nothing about the impenetrable woman betrayed {{that she had been}} watching through the night.|$|R
60|$|He {{scarcely}} {{touched her}} hand, anxious {{only to get}} away. And then {{the door opened and}} a man of somewhat remarkable appearance entered the room with the air of a privileged person. He was oddly dressed, with little regard to the fashion of the moment. His black coat was cut after the mode of a past generation, his collar was of the type affected by Gladstone and his fellow-statesmen, his black bow was arranged with studied negligence and he showed more frilled white shirt-front than is usual in the daytime. His silk hat was glossy but broad-brimmed; his masses <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> brushed back from a high, broad forehead, gave him almost a patriarchal aspect. His features were large and fairly well-shaped, but his mouth was weak and his cheeks lacked the color of a healthy life. Tavernake stared at him open-mouthed. He, for his part, looked at Tavernake as he might have looked at some strange wild animal.|$|E
6000|$|The {{character}} of this man was described to me, and the incident upon which the verses turn was told me by Mr. Pool, of Nether Stowey, with whom I became acquainted through our common friend S.T.C. During my residence at Alfoxden, I used to see {{a great deal of}} him, and had frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life, especially his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours. Their virtues he carefully encouraged, and weighed their faults in the scales of charity. If I seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer and his transgression too tenderly, it may in part be ascribed to my having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment. After his death was found in his escritoir a lock <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> carefully preserved, with a notice that it had been cut from the head of his faithful shepherd, who had served him for a length of years. I need scarcely add that he felt for all men as brothers. He was much beloved by distinguished persons:--Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Southey, Sir H. Davy, and many others, and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as a magistrate, a man of business, and in every other social relation. The latter part of the poem, perhaps, requires some apology, as being too much of an echo to the 'Reverie of Poor Susan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The club {{which now}} holds its weekly {{sessions}} here {{goes by the}} name of [...] "the Roaring Lads of Little Britain."

There is a madcap undertaker who is inimitable at a merry song, but the life of the club, and indeed the prime wit of Little Britain, is bully Wagstaff himself. His ancestors were all wags before him, and he has inherited with the inn a large stock of songs and jokes, which go with it from generation to generation as heirlooms. He is a dapper little fellow, with bandy legs and pot belly, a red face with a moist merry eye, and a little shock <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> behind. At the opening of every club night he is called in to sing his [...] "Confession of Faith," [...] which is the famous old drinking trowl from [...] "Gammer Gurton's Needle." [...] He sings it, to be sure, with many variations, as he received it from his father's lips; for it has been a standing favorite at the Half-Moon and Bunch of Grapes ever since it was written; nay, he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor of singing it before the nobility and gentry at Christmas mummeries, when Little Britain was in all its glory.* ...|$|E

The customary fivefold auspicious {{in the life of a}} Thirthankara have been described at great length by Ranna with his usual gusts and devotion and piety.

40|$|Introduction: Melanocyte {{stem cells}} (MelSCs) {{are known to}} be {{depleted}} in <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are important for maintenance of stemness of MelSCs. Methods: We compared the proportion of CD 200 + (Cluster of Differentiation 200 positive) stem cells in the outer root sheath cell suspension <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> and pigmented <b>hair</b> follicles of three patients with the premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> In addition, explants culture for HFSCs was also carried out from <b>gray</b> and pigmented <b>hair</b> follicles. Cultured HFSCs were also differentiated into melanocytes. Results: The mean ± SD CD 200 + HFSCs population were 9. 4 ± 1. 4 % and 3. 5 ± 0. 5 % for pigmented and <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicles, respectively (P = 0. 002). In explants culture, the growth of HFSCs from the <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicle stopped at around day 20 - 22, whereas the growth of the cells from the pigmented follicle continued. Conclusion: CD 200 + HFSCs are depleted in prematurely <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> in the humans. CD 200 + hair follicle stem cell yield is poorer in <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> explant culture than pigmented hair explant culture...|$|R
