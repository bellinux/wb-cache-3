40|$|Many {{rostering}} methods first create {{shifts from}} some given staffing levels, {{and after that}} create rosters from the set of created shifts. Although such a method has some nice properties, it also has some bad ones. In this paper we outline a method that creates rosters directly from staffing levels. We use a Branch-and-Price (B&P) method to solve this rostering problem and compare it to an ILP formulation of the subclass of rostering problems studied in this paper. The two methods perform almost equally well. Branch-and-Price, though, {{turns out to be}} a far more flexible approach to solve rostering problems. It is not too hard to extend the Branch-and-Price model with extra rostering constraints. However, for ILP this is much harder, if not impossible. Next to this, the Branch-and-Price method is more <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvements</b> and hence, combined with the larger flexibility, we consider it better suited to create rosters directly from staffing levels in practice...|$|R
40|$|Influential economists, like Bruno S. Frey and Richard Layard, are advocating {{that the}} {{standard}} approach in economics of inferring utility from changes in consumption and leisure should be augmented or replaced by use of subjective measures. But psychologists claim that adult life satisfaction (or happiness) {{is more or less}} fixed; it has a "set-point" which is largely determined by genetic factors and early childhood development. Analyses of life-span data, collected by the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) in the last 20 years, challenge this claim. About a quarter of the West German population experienced substantial changes in life satisfaction, but losses outweighed gains by a ratio of about 3 : 1. It is likely that a major reason for the negative balance is relatively poor economic performance since the early 1990 s. On the other hand, the results show that the "set-point theory" of psychologists is seriously flawed. Life satisfaction can change and may be <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvement</b> via individual life choices and/or public policy. ...|$|E

Furthermore, performance assessment is seen as a way of achieving care of high standards.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a method to}} solve {{personnel}} rostering problems is outlined. The method discussed creates rosters directly from staffing levels and employee preferences. This opposed to lots of other rostering methods that first create shifts based on the staffing levels and after that create rosters from the set of created shifts. Via an example it is stressed that this `two-step' approach is suboptimal and sometimes even {{unable to find a}} solution. To create rosters directly from staffing levels and employee preferences we modelled the rostering problem as a Branch-and-Price problem. To assess the quality of the Branch-and-Price model we compared an implementation of it with the implementation of an integer linear programming formulation of the rostering problem. This comparison is based on a significant number of generated data sets to explore {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these models. From these results the Branch-and-Price model looks very promising, because both implementations perform almost equally well. However, opposed to the integer linear programming approach, the Branch-and-Price method is more <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvements</b> and more flexible towards implementations in practise. ...|$|R

Drawing on related research in academic, moral and stereotyping domains, development of a psychometric instrument assessing athletic ability beliefs is detailed.

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a structure comprising two higher-order factors of entity and incremental beliefs underpinned by beliefs that athletic ability is stable and a gift (entity), and is <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvement</b> and can be developed through learning (incremental). Incremental beliefs, indirectly through a task goal orientation, and entity beliefs directly, predicted self-reported amotivation towards physical education and sport. On the other hand, enjoyment of physical activity in youth was predicted directly by task orientation and incremental beliefs. Predictions concerning the moderating role of perceived competence were not supported.

With the perspective of mathematics as open-textured, I make the case that this allows us to deploy the tools of conceptual engineering in mathematics. I will examine Cappelen's recent argument that there are no conceptual safe spaces and consider whether mathematics constitutes a counterexample. I argue that it does not, drawing on Haslanger's distinction between manifest and operative concepts, and applying this in a novel way to set-theoretic foundations. I then set out some of the questions that need to be engaged with to establish mathematics as involving a kind of conceptual engineering. I finish with a case study of how the tools of conceptual engineering will give us a way to progress in the debate between advocates of the Universe view and the Multiverse view in set theory...|$|E

In addition, the creation of professional community is not an automatic consequence of teacher empowerment or school autonomy.

S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Chemistry, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2016. Chemical control over singlet oxygen generation is an <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvement</b> {{because of the}} importance of this reactive species in biological systems. In the first project, we aimed to synthesize a silylated 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene endoperoxide derivative which is expected to release singlet oxygen on thermolysis at a relatively slow rate at room temperature. Upon the deprotection of the silyl units with fluorine ions, it is expected it to release singlet oxygen at a much higher rate, giving rise to a control over the release of the product. The absorption and the fluorescence measurement with a trap molecule which consumes the generated singlet oxygen reveals promising results for the future work for the control of singlet oxygen generation rates. In the second part of this thesis, we focused on the synthesis of a novel fluorescent sensor of a BODIPY derivative which is capable of sensing Zinc cations. The zinc complex is also expected to have a further usage for the sensing of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, which are commonly produced in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. With this, it has a potential usage in the field of early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. by Cansu Kaya. M. S...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} traffic {{management}} and highway safety lies in proactive traffic management systems. Crash prediction models that use real-time traffic flow variables measured {{through a series}} of loop detectors are the most important component of such systems. A previous crash prediction model was developed with the matched case-control logistic regression technique. Although the model achieved reasonable classification accuracy, it remained <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvement</b> because of the limited study area, sample size, and transferability issues. Therefore, the previous work had been extended. Multivehicle freeway crashes under high- and low-speed traffic conditions were found to differ in severity and in their mechanism. The distribution of 5 -min average speeds obtained immediately before the crash from the loop detector station closest to the crash shows two approximate mound-shaped distributions. This distribution is used as the basis to separate the models for crashes occurring under the two speed conditions. The results show that, as expected, variables that entered in the final models (for crashes under high and low speeds) were not the same. However, they were found to be consistent with the probable mechanisms of crashes under the respective speed conditions. A possible implementation of the separate models {{with the use of the}} odds ratios and with the balancing of the threshold between achieving high classification of crash potential and the false alarm situation is presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Detection of QRS {{complexes}} {{and other}} types of ventricular beats is a basic component of ECG analysis. Many algorithms have been proposed and used because of the waves' shape diversity. Detection in a single channel ECG is important for several applications, such as in defibrillators and specialized monitors. Methods The developed heuristic algorithm for ventricular beat detection includes two main criteria. The first of them is based on steep edges and sharp peaks evaluation and classifies normal QRS complexes in real time. The second criterion identifies ectopic beats by occurrence of biphasic wave. It is modified to work with a delay of one RR interval in case of long RR intervals. Other algorithm branches classify already detected QRS complexes as ectopic beats if a set of wave parameters is encountered or the ratio of latest two RR intervals RR i- 1 /RR i is less than 1 : 2. 5. Results The algorithm was tested with the AHA and MIT-BIH databases. A sensitivity of 99. 04 % and a specificity of 99. 62 % were obtained in detection of 542014 beats. Conclusion The algorithm copes successfully with different complicated cases of single channel ventricular beat detection. It is aimed to simulate to some extent the experience of the cardiologist, rather than to rely on mathematical approaches adopted from the theory of signal analysis. The algorithm is <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>improvement,</b> especially in the part concerning the discrimination between normal QRS complexes and ectopic beats. </p...|$|E
