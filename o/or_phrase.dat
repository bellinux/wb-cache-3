5000|$|In written language, {{mentioned}} words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> {{often appear}} {{between quotation marks}} (as in [...] "'Chicago' contains three vowels") or in italics (as in [...] "When I say honey, I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as Strunk and White insist that mentioned words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> must always be made visually distinct in this manner. Used words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence {{of the use of}} stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> through semantic and pragmatic cues.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes a word <b>or</b> <b>phrase.</b> The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
