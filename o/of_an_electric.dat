40|$|Purpose. Development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{brushless}} valve <b>electric</b> {{drive with}} <b>a</b> minimum apparatus excess for an autonomous floating vehicle. Methodology. The construction <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> contactless DC motor {{and the subsequent}} technical implementation of such automated electric drive under various control methods are possible using coordinate transformations of differential equations describing the electric motor under the assumed assumptions. Results. The analysis of the current state <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> brushless DC motor in a special technique is carried out, possible directions {{for the improvement of}} automated electric drives are determined. A simple technical solution <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> brushless DC motor was proposed and its mathematical model for <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> drive <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automatic floating vehicle with improved technical and economic parameters was developed. Model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> brushless DC motor are carried out. Originality. A simple technical solution for the construction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> brushless DC motor is proposed, which excludes the use of intermediate computation <b>of</b> coordinates and <b>an</b> expensive encoder. Practical value. Model of the proposed scheme <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> minimum hardware redundancy, which confirmed the operability of the proposed solution, were carried out. Analysis of the dynamic and static characteristics of the proposed scheme <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated asynchronous <b>electric</b> drive with <b>a</b> brushless DC motor with a simplified rotor position sensor has made it possible to determine the maximum speed control range with <b>an</b> allowable level <b>of</b> its pulsations...|$|R

5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E

The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E

5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted as a source <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> field, and a time-varying electric field {{was a source of}} a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide in the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
