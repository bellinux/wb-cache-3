5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E

5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} Taliban. Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E
5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 2008, Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Matin {{and one of}} his sub-commanders, Mullah Karim Agha, {{along with}} several bodyguards were {{travelling}} through the desert near Gereshk, Helmand province on motorbikes when they were ambushed and killed by an SBS unit dropped into his path by helicopter. In February 2009, members of the SBS took part in Operation Diesel, which resulted in the seizure of £50 million of heroin and the killing of at least 20 Taliban insurgents. On 9 September 2009, an SBS team supported by the SFSG rescued Times journalist Stephen Farrell after he and his Afghan interpreter were captured by the Taliban whilst reporting on the Kunduz airstrike and were held at a Taliban safe house in Char Dara District, Kunduz Province. The British special forces were forced to act when signal intercepts <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> leader showed them discussing moving the hostages into Pakistan. They were inserted by 160th SOAR helicopters at pre-dawn directly onto the target building, whilst the SFSG set up a cordon, the Afghan interpreter was accidentally shot and killed as was two civilians by an explosive breaching charge on the compound, whilst a soldier from the SFSG was killed, Farrell was rescued. On 1 July 2010 whilst carrying out an operation against insurgents in Haji Wakil, Helmand Province, Corporal Seth Stephens of the SBS was killed during a heavy firefight whilst clearing a compound, {{as a result of his}} actions during that operation, he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. On 15 April 2012, during the Taliban attack on Kabul SBS member cleared Taliban militants from a central location overlooking foreign embassies.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 2007, an SBS team {{killed the}} Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah after JSOC and the ISA tracked {{him to a}} {{compound}} - where his associates were meeting - near Bahram Chah, Helmand province. The ISA confirmed he was there and an SBS reconnaissance element carried out reconnaissance of the compound which showed that Dadullah was protected 20 insurgents. That night, with the ISA monitoring the target, the majority of C Squadron were inserted by RAF CH-47D Chinooks whilst covered by Apache helicopters, the troops stormed the compound and a one hour long firefight took place as small groups <b>of</b> <b>Taliban</b> were hunted down and killed. 4 SBS personnel were wounded (one seriously), eventually Dadullah {{was shot in the}} chest and head, quick SSE was conducted and before the assault force was picked up by helicopter. On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah, they had been kidnapped 2 days before. Col Moschin parachuted onto a drop zone and marched overnight to surround the target compound, whilst the SBS were standing by in Lynx and Chinook helicopters to provide cut off groups in-case the insurgents attempted to escape, whilst a US Predator drone supported the British and Italians. The insurgents brought the hostages out of the compound and loaded them into vehicles before the Italians were in position to rescue them, the SBS closed in on the vehicles: aerial snipers using M82A1 antimaterial rifles forced the vehicles to stop. A Chinook dropped off more than a dozen SBS personnel who engaged the Taliban who were disembarking the vehicles, 8 Taliban insurgents were killed and the hostages were rescued, however one died of gunshot wounds.|$|E

Learning of the power vacuum that was created by Mullah Omar’s death, Agha departed arguing that all sides <b>of</b> the <b>Taliban</b> should regulate their affairs from inside of Afghanistan. During and up to this time, the Taliban was experiencing internal ruptures in their ranks over who should be appointed the new leader <b>of</b> the <b>Taliban.</b> In November, a new leader for the political office in Qatar was named and news sources took this {{as a sign that}} peace talks with Afghanistan would soon resume.|$|R
