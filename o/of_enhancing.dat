5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, has the effect <b>of</b> <b>enhancing</b> the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution {{by a factor of}} nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E

Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, <b>of</b> <b>enhancing</b> LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning as a way <b>of</b> <b>enhancing</b> natural productivity, what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems {{over a period of}} nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E

40|$|Downslope {{flows and}} regions <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling have {{important}} impacts on {{society and the}} environment. Parameterisation of these often subgrid-scale phenomena in numerical models requires a sound understanding of the underlying physical processes, {{which has been the}} overarching aim of this work. A numerical model has been used to characterise the development of a region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling in an idealised alpine valley with width and depth of order 10 and 1 km, respectively, under stable, decoupled, poorly-drained conditions. A focus of this work has been to remove the uncertainty surrounding the forcing mechanisms behind the development <b>of</b> regions <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling. The average valley-atmosphere cooling {{has been found to be}} almost equally partitioned between radiative and dynamics effects. Complex interactions between the downslope flows and the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling have been quantified for the first time. For example, relatively large variations in the downslope flows are generally restricted to the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling and cannot solely be attributed to the analytical model of [McNider, 1982 a]. These flow variations generally coincide with return flows above the downslope flows, where a thin region of unstable air occurs, as well as coinciding with elongated downslope flow structures. The impact of these interactions on the dispersion of passive pollutants has been investigated. For example, pollutants are generally trapped within the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling. The concentration of pollutants within the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling, emitted over the lower half of the slopes, increase as the emission source moves away from the ground-based inversion that expands from the bottom of the valley. The concentration of pollutants within the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling is very similar when varying the location of the emission source over the top half of the valley slopes. This work includes a test of the effects of varying the horizontal numerical grid resolution on average valley-atmosphere temperature changes...|$|R

5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods <b>of</b> <b>enhancing</b> the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} used to characterize the development of a region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling in an alpine valley with a width of order (Formula presented.) km, under decoupled stable conditions. The region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling develops largely as a region of relatively dry air which partitions the valley atmosphere dynamics into two volumes, with airflow partially trapped within the valley by a developing elevated inversion. Complex interactions between the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling and the downslope flows are quantified. The cooling within the region <b>of</b> <b>enhanced</b> cooling and the elevated inversion is almost equally partitioned between radiative and dynamic effects. By the end of the simulation, the different valley atmospheric regions approach a state of thermal equilibrium with one another, though this cannot be said of the valley atmosphere and its external environment. ?? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
