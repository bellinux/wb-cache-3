5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> the Islamic world, and {{official}} pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab (school of law) were {{made available to the}} general public. Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.|$|E

5|$|At {{this period}} the Llanbadarn {{community}} {{was dominated by}} Sulien (1011–91) and his remarkable family. Around 1055 Sulien, who {{was born into a}} family educated for many generations in the clas monastic school or college of Llanbadarn Fawr, returned there after five years study in Scotland and ten years study in Ireland (according to his son and biographer). After this time Llanbadarn Fawr became possibly the foremost place <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> Wales. Sulien went on to be known as Sulien the Wise. He became the abbot of Llanbadarn Fawr and served as Bishop of St David's twice. Under his abbacy Llanbadarn Fawr's monastic library grew in size and importance; reputedly larger than those of Canterbury Cathedral and York Minster.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival <b>of</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> the Renaissance {{and the advent of}} the first English translation of the Iliad in the form of Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.|$|E

In the article various existing blended learning models and the ways of their adaptation are considered. It is shown that the use of different forms <b>of</b> online <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> combination with traditional learning makes it possible to achieve higher efficiency of education, but the transition from traditional forms of training into the area of free educational space is not easy and requires a lot of effort. ? ?????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ? ??????? ??????? ???????????. ????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????, ??????? ? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ? ?????????????? ????????. ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ????????, ???????????? ?????????? ????????. ????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????. ??????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????. ? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ????? ?????????????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????. ????????, ??? ????????????? ????????? ???? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????? ? ??????? ????????...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine empire {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E

5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> ancient Greece.|$|E
