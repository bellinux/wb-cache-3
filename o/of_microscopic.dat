5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just {{beginning}} to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> dissection and staining.|$|E

5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will.

In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> potentials.|$|E

L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E
5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{nonlinear}} confocal microscopic {{imaging system}} based on Raman induced Kerr effect spectroscopy (RIKES) is presented in this paper. The three-dimensional (3 -D) microscopic imaging theory is derived with the Fourier imaging theory and nonlinear optical principle. The impact of RIKES on the spatial resolution and imaging properties <b>of</b> confocal <b>microscopic</b> imaging system has been analyzed in detail by the imaging theory. It’s proved that the RIKES nonlinear microscopic imaging system can effectively improve the imaging contrast and provide more characteristic information on Raman spectrum and optical nonlinear Kerr effect, thus greatly improving the imaging quality <b>of</b> confocal <b>microscopic</b> imaging system. It’s shown that the spatial resolution <b>of</b> RIKES confocal <b>microscopic</b> imaging system is higher than that <b>of</b> two-photon confocal <b>microscopic</b> imaging system...|$|R

ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} to P.hispanica, but may distinguished by its mycenoid (Mycena-like) appearance and acute umbonate cap. Although the grassland habitat {{of the two}} species is similar, P.semilanceata does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots. P.fimetaria also resembles P.hispanica, {{but it also has}} a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> characteristics, P.fimetaria has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20–32 by 4–8μm. P.hispanica differs from P.liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. Deconica coprophila (formerly known as Psilocybe coprophila) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> (0.06-3.0mm), worm-like, pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} {{described}} by Peck were distinguished {{on the basis}} of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping. In terms <b>of</b> <b>microscopic</b> characters, spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting Peck's concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, McIlvaine (1902), Hard (1908), and McDougall (1925) reported (as variety or species) only C.ebulbosus. Bisby (1938), Christensen (1946), Smith (1958), and Groves (1962) mentioned only C.quadrifidus. Both Kauffman (1918) and Graham (1944) described C.ebulbosus and C.quadrifidus; Graham, however, only included C.quadrifidus in his key to his descriptions of Coprinus species. In 1979, W.Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to synonymy with Coprinopsis variegata, the earliest name.|$|E
