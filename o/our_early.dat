25|$|William Ruddiman has {{proposed}} the early anthropocene hypothesis, {{according to which}} the anthropocene era, as some people call the most recent period in the earth's history when {{the activities of the}} human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century {{with the advent of the}} Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of <b>our</b> <b>early</b> agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.|$|E

On June 30, 2003, ADV recalled the North American DVDs because they failed to include the original Japanese tracks made by Shinkai and Shinohara. ADV Films UK released the DVD in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2003. ADV Films UK also released a Shinkai Collection DVD set, containing Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in <b>Our</b> <b>Early</b> Days, on September 3, 2007.

[...] "It not only showed how great their voices were together, but showed the power the music would have in the story." [...] However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with her co-star as [...] "nerve-racking". The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice.

500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of <b>our</b> <b>early</b> songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco.

500|$|For recording, the Doors hired Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff {{and rhythm}} guitarist Marc Benno {{to round out}} their sound, with Scheff, in particular, {{contributing}} on every track except [...] "L'America". Densmore characterized Scheff as [...] "an in-the-pocket man" [...] and praised how he [...] "allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast". By all accounts, Morrison– a huge Presley fan– was excited by Scheff's participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate {{as a result of}} his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as [...] "blues day", recording [...] "Crawling King Snake", [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window", and [...] "L.A. Woman". The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, [...] "The overall concept for the recording session was to go back to <b>our</b> <b>early</b> roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible". Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris, France.|$|E
500|$|While Thomas Pownall is {{well known}} as an American colonial Governor and English politician, {{he was also an}} {{important}} figure in [...] later 18th century antiquarian and archaeological studies. In her study of Governor Pownall, Bryony Orme [...] remarks that he [...] is {{perhaps one of the most}} neglected of <b>our</b> <b>early</b> antiquaries , and undeservedly so. He inherited these interests from his father Captain William Pownall, who lived at No. 5 Pottergate in the Minster Yard, which surrounds Lincoln Cathedral. His father had corresponded with William Stukeley about ancient finds in and around Lincoln, [...] and Thomas Pownall’s brother John was also a writer on archaeological subjects. Pownall was already demonstrating his interest in archaeology before he left for America, when, in 1752, [...] he recorded evidence for a Roman villa at Glentworth in Lincolnshire After [...] his return from America he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770 and he contributed extensively to early issues of the journal Archaeologia. Some of his writings describe discoveries around Lincoln, but more importantly he wrote more widely [...] on New Grange in Ireland in 1773 and Cairn Brach y Dinas at Penmaenmawr, on the north Welsh coast. He was to follow this with descriptions of Roman remains in France when he was living there, and, on moving to Bath he again provided descriptions of [...] Roman discoveries.|$|E
500|$|The early 20th-century {{historian}} W. H. Stevenson observed that: [...] "Few {{things in}} <b>our</b> <b>early</b> history {{have led to}} so much discussion" [...] as Æthelwulf's Decimation Charters; a hundred years later the charter expert Susan Kelly described them as [...] "one {{of the most controversial}} groups of Anglo-Saxon diplomas". Both Asser and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle say that Æthelwulf gave a decimation, in 855, shortly before leaving on pilgrimage to Rome. According to the Chronicle [...] "King Æthelwulf conveyed by charter the tenth part of his land throughout all his kingdom to the praise of God and to his own eternal salvation". However, Asser states that [...] "Æthelwulf, the esteemed king, freed the tenth part of his whole kingdom from royal service and tribute, and as an everlasting inheritance he made it over on the cross of Christ to the triune God, for the redemption of his soul and those of his predecessors." [...] According to Keynes, Asser's version may just be a [...] "loose translation" [...] of the Chronicle, and his implication that Æthelwulf released a tenth of all land from secular burdens was probably not intended. All land could be regarded as the king's land, so the Chronicle reference to [...] "his land" [...] does not necessarily refer to royal property, and since the booking of land– conveying it by charter– was always regarded as a pious act, Asser's statement that he made it over to God {{does not necessarily mean that}} the charters were in favour of the church.|$|E
