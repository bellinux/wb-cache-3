5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (<b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much)</b> snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E

5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} this block can be {{dominated}} by either of these considerations, or can be a complex process juggling the interactions of the two. Typical trade-offs are: increasing the bandwidth usually degrades the stability <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> damping for better stability will reduce the speed and increase settling time. Often also the phase-noise is affected.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|Both the Bourne Eau and the Glen were {{affected}} by flooding, causing failure of the banks, which was addressed in the Black Sluice act of 1765. The history of navigation is intimately tied up {{with that of the}} Bourne Eau, since Bourne was the main centre of population above Spalding. The Bourne Eau act of 1781 appointed trustees, who were to scour and cleanse the river, and could charge tolls to fund the operation. Corn and wool passed down the river, bound for Boston, while coal and groceries were the principal cargo in the opposite direction. In 1792, Thomas Hawkes wrote about trade in timber, which was carried from Bourne to Spalding, and there was a boat which carried passengers to the market at Spalding on Tuesdays, but he comments that the service was erratic, as there was often too little <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water for the vessels to operate. The Black Sluice Commissioners installed flood doors between the Glen and the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, to prevent high water levels in the Glen passing up the river to Bourne.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] was a [...] "supremely catchy pop tune" [...] {{and that the}} video was [...] "the {{perfectly}} blissed-out accompaniment." [...] Montgomery chided the video for [...] "not making much sense" [...] but noted [...] "that hardly matters" [...] as [...] "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect formula for pop success: Don't think too big, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like I said, you can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't ever say she's not smart." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the {{challenge}} to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, [...] "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you {{need a lot of}} straight men... Let's not give them too much Jack. It's like too much dessert <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a good thing." [...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, Jentleson et al. outline that {{reciprocity}} {{involves an}} explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions.

Saponification charts should also be used in hot processes, but are not necessary for the [...] "fully boiled hot-process" [...] soaping.|$|E
2500|$|Ngugi was criticised however for his stylistic form in Petals of Blood. It was {{suggested}} that the social realism of the novel did not accurately represent or complement the socialist ideals put forth. John Updike suggested that Ngugi's desire to permeate the plot with political ideas detracts from his writing. The novel's plot was also deemed to be [...] "rambling" [...] {{as well as being}} too short, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> curtailed.|$|E
2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> sand for the same reason, or using too little water, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E

2500|$|If {{clogging}} occurs, it {{is usually}} the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> toilet paper. Flushing of large amounts of hair should also be avoided. However, clogging can occur spontaneously due to limescale fouling of the drain pipe, or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based {{on the size of the}} drainage pipe, the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is also a contributing, but hard-to-predict factor.|$|E
2500|$|Since Gordon Ramsay {{employed}} {{his former}} protégé Marcus Wareing {{in the less}} formal Savoy Grill, the restaurant earned its first Michelin star. The Grill was originally [...] "where people go to eat a modest luncheon or to dine {{on the way to}} the theatre without spending too much time <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money." [...] Since 2010, the chef patron has been Stuart Gillies. From 2015 to 2017, Kim Woodward, a former contestant on the TV show , became the Grill's first female Head Chef. The Thames Foyer serves breakfast, morning coffee, light lunch and supper, as well as afternoon tea, accompanied by the hotel's resident pianist. Also part of the hotel buildings is Simpson's-in-the-Strand, featuring classic British style cuisine. Its specialties are aged Scottish beef on the bone, potted shrimps, roast saddle of lamb and steak and kidney pie.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{section of}} the law laid that {{whenever}} men left the camp, they had to wear full uniform – {{even if they were}} just going along the road to have a drink and meet English friends in one of the pubs in Birtley. The catch was that, apart from most of the pubs in Birtley being out of bounds in any case (as agreed jointly by the British and Belgian authorities – to prevent over-indulgence <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> ‘hob-knobbing’ with the natives were the ‘reasons’), the Belgian soldier was not supposed to enter a British pub in uniform! On top of that, the British police seem to have been extremely worried about violent confrontations between the locals and the Belgians, ignoring the fact that violent confrontation had long been a normal feature of life in Birtley, especially at weekends. Furthermore, there was not always harmony within the colony or the factory themselves. [...] Worker-management lines also divided along the long-standing antipathy between the Dutch-speaking Flemish workers and the French-speaking Walloon management of the community.|$|E
50|$|Apelidos {{can come}} from many {{different}} things, such as a physical characteristic (like being tall or big), a habit (like smiling <b>or</b> drinking <b>too</b> <b>much),</b> place of birth, a particular skill, an animal, or trivial things.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} for a few moments, and then Sadie leaned forward. [...] "I don't know if I've said enough, <b>or</b> said <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but Bob goes back in three days and could take a message." ...|$|R
