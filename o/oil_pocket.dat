40|$|AbstractLubricant {{retention}} during sliding of {{mating surfaces}} {{is one of}} the major problems encountered in the industrial components. The efficiency of the engine is affected by the frictional losses taking place at the engine liner-piston ring interface. The coefficient of friction and the resulting wear is directly related to the effectiveness of the lubrication. One of the methods to achieve good lubrication is by making oil pockets on the surface of the component. This leads to a mixed lubrication regime. The objective of this study focuses on the influence of <b>oil</b> <b>pocket</b> distribution on the effectiveness of lubrication. Oil pockets were made on the liner-ring samples. To simulate the wear behavior, reciprocating wear tests were performed on liner-ring samples at different experimental conditions. Three basic parameters such as load, temperature and frequency were considered for the analysis. The result of this experiment will be analysed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} the Elasto-Hydrodynamic Lubrication?EHL?of thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors, resulting in the superior lubrication characteristics of these bearings. The thrust plate undergoes elastic deformation due to axial loading, resulting in the formation of a uniform fluid wedge between the orbiting and fixed thrust plates. This wedge region has very high induced oil film pressure, which explains the remarkably good lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing. Furthermore, the high oil film pressure induces further local elastic deformation of the thrust plate, forming an EHL <b>oil</b> <b>pocket</b> with the thrust plate and a further increase in the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces due to this oil envelopment. The formation of the EHL pocket was confirmed using FEM analysis and lubrication tests on the elastic deformation of the thrust plate. Subsequently, the additional increase in oil film pressure, due to the EHL pocket effect, was examined in computer simulations applying the average Reynolds equation for the boundary of elastic deformation of the thrust plate. In these studies, a 6. 7 % increase in oil film pressure was ascertained for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW motor. The oil envelopment contributes to the superior lubrication performance of the thrust slide bearings scroll compressors...|$|E

Usually surface topographies of car engine parts are studied after form removal. Many algorithms and procedures were developed and suggested. However, the selection of reference plane with accordance to surface topography measurements of cylindrical elements was not fully recognized. In this paper least squares fitting methods (cylinder, polynomial) and commercial filters (Gaussian filter, Gaussian regression filter and robust Gaussian regression filter) for areal form removal were compared and proposed. Three types of surfaces: cylinder liners after plateau-honing, plateau-honed cylinder liners with <b>oil</b> <b>pockets</b> created by burnishing techniques and turned piston skirts were analyzed. Distortion of surface topography parameters (from ISO 25178 standard) according to improper selection of reference plane was also taken into consideration.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the scientific area of surface topography on sheet metal surfaces. The studies are restricted to exploring the influence of the steel sheet,s surface topography on forming properties and on appearance after painting. They also deal with problems associated with the measuring of surface topography in three dimensions (3 D). In six papers the results from experimental studies concerning measuring, friction, and painting of sheet metal surfaces are presented. The results can contribute, on the one hand to the development of new surface geometries for the steel producer, while on the other hand increasing the possibilities of the steel users to specify the sheet material,s surface topography more linked to the desired functions of the surface. The 3 D approach for assessment of surface topography has been adopted {{in order to understand the}} relations between the functional demands on the sheet metal surface and its surface topography. Compared to profile measurements, a 3 D measurement offers completely new possibilities to understand the surface microgeometry from a functional point of view. The lack of standards for 3 D analysis of surface topography prompted investigations of different measurement and evaluation strategies. The sampling area size was identified as important in order to obtain single measurements that are representative of the whole sheet surface. The filtering of surface measurements is a critical part of the topographical analysis. A ball filtering technique was adopted and implemented. The result of such an envelope filtering is determined by the topmost part of the surface, similar to the actual contact between sheet and tool. The influence of surface topography on paint appearance was investigated by fourier analysis of both surface profiles and 3 D measurements. The results revealed that the possibility to produce a superior paint finish was increased when no waviness existed in the range 0. 8 - 3 mm in the unpainted surface. Analysis of the areal information in the surface topography, such as contact and lubrication morphologies, shows relations to friction properties. For a heavy oil it was shown that the presence of relatively large isolated <b>oil</b> <b>pockets</b> decreases the coefficient of friction. The results point at a minor influence from the amplitude of the surface topography while the lateral surface features are of major importance for obtaining a desirable surface topography in the contact interface between sheet and tool...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{success of}} many sheet forming {{operations}} depends critically on the friction {{of the sheet}} on the blankholder. First we review briefly the various frictional mechanisms involved and discuss mainly the occurrence of hydrodynamic effects at macroscopic and microscopic scales, {{especially with regard to}} the experimental work performed by Emmens (Proc. 15 th Bienn. Congr. IDDRG, Dearborn, MI, May 1988, ASM International, 1988, pp. 63 – 70). Then we describe the results of friction measurements performed with a tribometer on four low carbon steel sheets: two high formability sheets with electro-discharge texture and laser-textured roughness, a high strength sheet and a hot dip-galvanized sheet with laser-textured roughness; friction tests were performed between two flat tools at two contact pressures p (about 10 – 30 MPa), two sliding speeds V (about 2 – 60 mm s− 1) and along the rolling direction and the transverse direction. The friction of the galvanized sheet is rather isotropic and decreases markedly as the ratio V/p increases; in contrast, the friction of the uncoated sheets is anisotropic and its decrease as V/p increases is smaller. Observations by optical microscopy of the surface of the sheets after friction testings provide three major results: a small decrease in the friction coefficient μ corresponds generally to a more marked decrease in the final plateaux area. At very low value of the Vp ratio where hydrodynamic effects cannot occur friction is the sum of two mechanisms: at a very small scale the formation of waves, with moderate friction μ ≈ 0. 12, and at the greater scale of the plateaux of the sheet surface shearing of transfer film, with higher friction μ ≈ 0. 22; the extent of each mechanism depends on the sheet roughness texture. As the ratio V/p increases the viscosity of the lubricant promotes the formation of a very thin lubricant film (thickness 10 – 70 nm) on the plateaux which slightly reduces the friction coefficient and more markedly the extent of the two previous mechanisms and the associated surface damage of the sheet and tool surface. This effect is effective before the generation of pressure by viscous shearing of <b>oil</b> <b>pockets</b> proposed by Emmens and responsible of a very marked decrease in friction at high values of the V/p ratio...|$|R

40|$|Primary and Secondary Recovery {{techniques}} {{together are}} able to recover only about 35 - 50 % of oil from the reservoir. This leaves {{a significant amount of}} oil remaining in the reservoir. The residual oil left after the water flooding is either from water swept part or area by-passed by the water flooding. The by-passed residual oil has a high interfacial tension with the water. One way of recovering this capillary trapped oil is by flooding the reservoir with chemicals (surfactant, alkali-surfactant (AS), surfactant-polymer (SP), or alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP)). The Norne field which is the base case for this study having approximately current recovery factor of 60 % with water flooding {{is one of the best}} subsea fields in the world. The oil production has peaked in 2001 and is now declining. The <b>pockets</b> of residual <b>oil</b> saturation are still trapped in the reservoir especially in the Ile and Tofte formations. The water flooding alone cannot recover capillary trapped <b>oil</b> <b>pockets</b> efficiently, thus requires enhanced oil recovery techniques. The EOR screening criteria suggested by Taber et al. (1) was applied to Norne E-segment in order to come up with the right EOR method that would reduce residual oil saturation to the minimum. Five EOR scenarios such as surfactant flooding, alkaline-surfactant flooding, polymer flooding, surfactant-polymer flooding, and alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding were simulated for the Norne E-segment. The main objective of this study was to do a comparative simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of these chemical methods (scenarios) compared to a conventional waterflooding in terms of incremental oil production. After this, one of the flooding methods was to be concluded for the Norne E-segment based on incremental net present value (NPV). The injection well F- 3 H and producer E- 2 H were evaluated as the most promising wells for above scenarios. A series of cases were run to ascertain the injection length, appropriate surfactant quantity and concentration. Five scenarios with different combination and concentrations of chemicals (alkali, surfactant and polymer) were run using Eclipse 100. In addition, calculation of incremental NPV based on incremental oil production for all scenarios; single parameter sensitivity analysis (Spider plot) for low case, base case, and high case at different oil prices, chemicals prices, and discount rate were also performed. It was found that change in oil price has substantial effect on NPV compared to other parameters while surfactant price is the least sensitive parameter i. e very low affect on NPV for high/low case. From simulation results and economics analysis, ASP flooding was found to be better than other chemical methods (scenarios) in terms of incremental NPV for the Norne E-segment. However, the 1. 40 % incremental recovery factor by ASP flooding seems not so high and will have an incremental net present value of + 123. 53 million USD. It is noted that the additional costs regarding operations and installations were not included in the economics calculation. The recovery factor as well as NPV can be optimized with accurate chemical designing in laboratory and modeling of compositional model in Chemical Compositional Simulator. It is recommended that right alkali, surfactant and polymer structure that would be compatible with fluid and rock properties of Norne field E-segment, be developed in the laboratory. It is also important that up-scaling the appropriate laboratory identified chemicals to a field-scale usage be done correctly. The timing of ASP injection into Norne E-segment is also recommended to be early in the life of the field because injection of ASP at a later time might not lead to best possible oil recovery. </p...|$|R

Pilger in order to acquire ancillary information to support its standardization as a raw material for the production of phytotherapic preparations. Phytochemical analysis was based on the fractionation of its hydroalcoholic extract exhibiting antimicrobial activity. The pharmacognostic investigation involved morphoanatomical and physicochemical characterization using pharmacopea methods. The hydroalcoholic extract and its fractions, particularly the ethyl acetate fraction, had antimicrobial effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not on Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Phytochemical investigation of the hydroalcoholic extract supplied five phenolic derivatives [ellagic acid, gallic acid, dihydrokaempferol, dihydrokaempferol- 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside and dihydrokaempferol- 3 -O-β-(6 ´´-galloyl) -glucopyranoside dihydrokaempferol] and two triacyl benzenes known as cochlospermines A and B. Excluding dihydrokaempferol and its glycoside, the compounds described are being isolated from this species for the first time. Dihydrokaempferol- 3 -O-β-(6 ´´-galloyl) -β-glucopyranoside was unpublished. The presence of phenolic acids corroborates the antimicrobial activity observed in the hydroalcoholic extract and the polar fractions extracted from roots. It also corroborates traditional usage of the roots for the treatment of infections.

At the age of eight, he invented an inkstone case with a secret lock, which required a cord to be twisted in a certain manner to open it. At the age of 14, he had invented a loom capable of weaving intricate designs into fabric. From age 20 he began to make karakuri dolls, autonomous dolls powered by springs, pneumatics and hydraulics, capable of relatively complex movements, which were much in demand by the aristocrats of Kyoto, daimyō in feudal domains, and by the Shōgun’s court in Edo. At age 21, he was performing around the country at festivals with clockwork dolls he constructed himself. He declined {{to take over the}} family business, surrendering his position to his younger brother and devoted his full attention to karakuri dolls. However, by his mid-thirties these mechanical dolls had started to fall out of fashion.

40|$|In recent years, the {{industry}} has shifted toward down-sizing and turbo-charging spark ignition (SI) engines {{in an effort to}} increase fuel conversion efficiency. However, this has given rise to a destructive phenomenon known as sporadic pre-ignition (SPI). At low cranking speeds and high loads, engines have been observed to knock violently for brief and infrequent intervals. If allowed to continue, these periods of knock will result in a destroyed engine. This study looks at the propensity of lube oil vapor appearing in the cylinder as a cause for this phenomenon. The theory is that a local <b>oil</b> vapor/air mixture <b>pocket</b> may auto-ignite and start a flame in the charge. The pre-ignition would produce extreme knock. A rapid compression machine (RCM) was used to simulate this scenario and determine if oil vapor can cause SPI, and if so, to relate the auto-ignition tendency to the oil properties. The RCM was used to measure the ignition delay of a cloud of oil vapor in a stoichiometric gasoline/air mixture. The ignition delays were then correlated to chemical and physical properties of the oils. Finally, the effect of diluting the mixture was assessed. The results suggest that lube oil is a plausible source of SPI. The oil ignition delay times are sufficiently short to produce extreme pre-ignition consistent with SPI. Further supporting evidence {{lies in the fact that}} oil ignition delay times concur with SPI behavior in engines.
