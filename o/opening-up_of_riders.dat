40|$|The rapid <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> {{the higher}} sector {{since the early}} 1980 s and the {{increasing}} range of courses on offer, particularly the development of short vocational courses, lead us to reconsider the issue of reducing social inequalities of access to schooling. The reality of democratisation is contested on two counts. It is suggested that it mainly concerns short higher education programmes, {{and it is possible}} that inequalities have taken on a different form and now concern the nature of the course attended. Compiling the Employment surveys from 1990 to 2002 allows us to study closely the changing link between social background and qualifications. The <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> higher education has not been accompanied by a slowdown in democratisation, at any level of qualification. Measured at a constant level of selection, the falling level of social selectiveness in higher education becomes clearer still. Democratisation in this sector remains limited, however.

This completed through contributions from people of the town, equivalent to two réis, and resulted in the expansion of trenches, reinforcement of the barbicans and the <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> a gap for expansion. This was accomplished through the demolish of various homes near the castle to permit the war effort: in 1644, the Marquess of Torrescusa had already proven the need to reinforce Elvas, with his siege of the castle.|$|R
50|$|Humans have ornamentally carved ivory since prehistoric times, though {{until the}} 19th-century <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> the {{interior}} of Africa, it was usually a rare and expensive material used for luxury products. Very fine detail can be achieved, and as the material, unlike precious metals, has no bullion value and usually cannot easily be recycled, the survival rate for ivory pieces {{is much higher than}} for those in other materials. Ivory carving has a special importance to the medieval art of Europe and Byzantium because of this, and in particular as so little monumental sculpture was produced or has survived.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the decade}} 1994 to 2004, the {{transition}} economies had closed {{some of the}} gap in income per person with the average for the European Union in purchasing power parity terms. These gains had been driven by sustained growth in productivity as obsolete capital stock was scrapped and production shifted to take advantage <b>of</b> the <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> foreign trade, price liberalization and foreign direct investment. However the rapid growth rates of that period of catch-up had stalled since the late 2000s and the prospects for income convergence have receded according to the EBRD’s prognosis, unless there are additional productivity-enhancing structural reforms.|$|R

Government statements and actions included both support for maintaining the forest (e.g. the proclamation of the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules in 1978); and support for activities which would have the opposite effect (e.g. legalisation of landholdings {{on the western side}} of the forest, and the <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> Marqués de Comillas with credit support for cattle, as well as state-sponsored oil exploration).

50|$|According to the EBRD a well-functioning {{market economy}} should enjoy a {{diverse range of}} {{economic}} activities, equality of opportunity and convergence of incomes.

On the EBRD’s measure of transition indicators the transition economies had become “stuck in transition”. Price liberalization, small-scale privatization and the <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> trade and foreign exchange markets were mostly complete {{by the end of the}} 1990s. However economic reform had slowed in areas such governance, enterprise restructuring and competition policy, which remained substantially below the standard of other developed market economies.|$|R

At present, this {{competition}} implies contested imaginations of the Franco-Spanish borderland. This article explores these imaginations in terms of cross-border and intra-state integration. Nationalist rhetoric substantially differs from daily cultural experiences and political practice. Paradoxically, the <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> the Franco-Spanish border {{as a result of}} European integration and the concomitant rise of cross-border cooperation have confined Basque national integration to the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. In this respect, both the old state border and internal administrative borders in Spain have acted as strong barriers against the diffusion of ethnonationalism...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{centrally}} located and distributed base pair mismatches (‘melting bubbles’) on localized bending and stiffness of short dsDNA fragments is evaluated using time-dependent fluorescence lifetime measurements. Distributed melting bubbles {{are found to}} induce larger bending angles and decreased levels of stiffness in DNA than {{centrally located}} ones of comparable overall size. Our results indicate that spontaneous local <b>opening-up</b> <b>of</b> the DNA duplex could facilitate sharp bending of short DNA strands {{even in the absence}} of DNA binding proteins. We also find that the occurrence of two closely spaced melting bubbles will generally be favored when a large energetic barrier must be overcome in forming the desired bent DNA structure...|$|R
