5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning. In addition, <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> model predicts the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This causes Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E

5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to {{pass through}} the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, with <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates before hitting the area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E

The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with an alphanumeric code based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate users are allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on <b>one</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of USB connector, {{including}} some that have been added while the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles; the B connector was necessary so that cabling could be plug ended at both ends and still prevent users from connecting <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> receptacle to another. The first engineering change notice to the USB2.0 specification added Mini-B plugs and receptacles.|$|E
5|$|V7 {{consists}} of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source GUI, named FAHControl. This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and {{has the ability to}} monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from <b>one</b> <b>computer.</b> FAHControl directs FAHClient, a back-end application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or slot). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.|$|E

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. <b>One</b> <b>computer</b> model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170miles (270km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. The depression initially moved west-northwestward, and shortly after forming it turned to the north-northwest. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220miles (350km) west of Manzanillo. By later that day, the convection wrapped around the center of circulation. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135miles (235km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Upon reaching hurricane status, <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> model predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California, though most forecast a turn to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, and later was extended to Zihuatanejo. Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall, <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> model predicted Carlotta to move ashore; due to the threat, the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo. Outer rainbands and rough surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration; officials evacuated about 100families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution. Precipitation and clouds were reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in flooding in some areas. No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds; however, Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44mph (71km/h). Heavy rainfall and rough seas were also reported on Socorro Island.|$|E

5|$|Situated to {{the south}} of a strong {{subtropical}} ridge, the depression tracked rapidly westward. With easterly wind shear, the structure was initially disorganized, although the system was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 48hours of developing, due to anticipated favorable conditions. <b>One</b> <b>computer</b> model predicted the depression would reach winds of around 115miles per hour (185km/h) by four days after development. Banding features increased while the satellite presentation continued to improve, and at 1200UTC on August16 the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal about 370miles (595km) east of Barbados. At the same time however, a QuikSCAT pass suggested the system did not contain a low-level circulation, and in post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center estimated the system degenerated into a tropical wave rather than attain tropical storm status. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2008USD). Hurricane Isabel formed from a {{tropical}} wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike. At least <b>one</b> <b>computer</b> model predicted a landfall on New Jersey, {{and as a result}} services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
