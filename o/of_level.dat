5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived in the area <b>of</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain. This included {{a wide range of}} animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E

In this article, I first examine the explanatory goals that have motivated accounts <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> organization. I then show that the most state-of-the-art and scientifically plausible account <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> organization, the account <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> mechanism proposed by Bechtel and Craver, is fundamentally problematic. Finally, I argue that the explanatory goals can be reached by adopting a deflationary approach, where <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> organization give way to more well-defined and fundamental notions, such as scale and composition...|$|R
40|$|Talk <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> or layers <b>of</b> {{reality is}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in science and}} in philosophy. It is widely assumed, for instance, that physical, chemical, biological, and mental phenomena can be ordered in a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>levels,</b> and that what happens at the so-called micro level determines the goings on at the macro level. Questions about both reduction and emergence presuppose some structure of levels; without this, the very question <b>of</b> whether higher <b>levels</b> reduce to more basic ones could not be asked. Often intuitions seem sufficient to establish the ordering and the nature <b>of</b> the <b>levels.</b> But, given the central importance of this picture, more should be said about how we identify levels, what populates them (objects, properties, facts, …), what principles govern the hierarchy, and how widely any particular account <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> is applicable. 1 In this paper we address these questions, taking our starting point within (classical) physics. We examine {{the features of the}} hierarchies, ordering principles, and population <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> in physics and argue that the structure <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> suggested by physics is quite different from that assumed in widely assumed philosophical schemes, in particular Oppenheim and Putnam’s (1958) account <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> reality...|$|R
40|$|Calls for the {{inclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> analysis in theory building and testing have increased over the last 25 years.

5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless <b>of</b> <b>level</b> or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and hair color, facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type <b>of</b> <b>level</b> called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and glaciation is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and agglomerate, tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as outliers, till cemented by siliceous sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs at Level Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland. However, like other large NCVP volcanoes, much <b>of</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain was formed prior to glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts <b>of</b> <b>level</b> of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in Final Fantasy games {{is to increase}} character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In Final Fantasy IX, weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use when the item is equipped (permitting the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped. In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters at the time <b>of</b> <b>level</b> up. Armor not only raises base defense or evasion statistics but raises defense and/or other statistics at level up.|$|E
5|$|The climate <b>of</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, casting a rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history <b>of</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
