5|$|When the seminary’s choir {{director}} died, {{the school}} administration requested that Leontovych take over this position.

Leontovych graduated from the Kamianets-Podilskiy Theological Seminary in 1899 and broke the family tradition by becoming a music teacher instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1636 {{the space}} beneath the south west tower became a bishop's consistory court. It was {{furnished}} as such at that time, {{and is now}} a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest,</b> in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which is unusually large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17thcentury saw additions to the furnishings and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19thcentury, the building was badly in need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{was shot}} in {{temporary}} studios in the house <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> named Moreira, which is now {{the location of the}} Jorge-Eliécer-Gaitán theatre. Initially, the film was shot with a Pathé camera with a 45mm lens, but later a 35mm Kodak Ektachrome was used. The chemicals used for the production of the film were purchased from Óptica Alemana, a company located in Bogotá founded in 1914 by Ernesto Schmidt Mumm. The photographic print was manufactured by the scientific section of airline SCADTA.|$|E
5|$|Ranulf Flambard (c. 1060– 5 September 1128) was {{a medieval}} Norman Bishop of Durham and an {{influential}} government minister of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf {{was the son}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have referred to his personality. He started his career under King William I of England, probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book, {{as well as being}} the keeper of the king's seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.|$|E

5|$|In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, {{appointed}} {{an elderly}} English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the parish and chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas Bowles spoke only English. The parishioners and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, {{arguing that the}} appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and Bowles {{should not have been}} appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let Bowles stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. Bowles was then replaced in the parish and chapelry with Richard Griffith, a priest who spoke Welsh.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b> The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|Thurstan or Turstin of Bayeux (c. 1070– 6 February 1140) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of York, the son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest.</b> He served kings William II and Henry I of England before his {{election}} to the see of York in 1114. Once elected, his consecration was delayed for five years while he fought attempts by the Archbishop of Canterbury to assert primacy over York. Eventually, he was consecrated by the pope instead and {{allowed to return to}} England. While archbishop, he secured two new suffragan bishops for his province. When Henry I died, Thurstan supported Henry's nephew Stephen of Blois as king. Thurstan also defended the northern part of England from invasion by the Scots, taking a leading part in organising the English forces at the Battle of the Standard (1138). Shortly before his death, Thurstan resigned from his see and took the habit of a Cluniac monk.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of the change of government, former viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{prepared}} a counter-revolution from the city of Córdoba, but Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo routed his militia and captured all the leaders {{in just a couple of}} skirmishes. The initial orders were to send them to Buenos Aires, but after their capture the Junta decided to execute them. This decision was taken in a resolution signed by all members of the Junta, excepting Manuel Alberti, because as a priest, he could not give consent to the death penalty. The measure found strong popular resistance in Córdoba, as Liniers and the governor Juan Gutierrez de la Concha were popular and the execution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> (Rodrigo de Orellana, another leader of the counter-revolution) was rejected as heretical. Ocampo and Chiclana decided to carry on with the original orders, and transferred the prisoners to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|William de Enysford's family {{continued}} to hold Eynsford Castle {{on behalf of the}} archbishop until 1261, through six descendants, all named William and therefore distinguished for convenience as William de Eynsford II through to VII by historians. Around 1130, a new hall was built in the castle, superseding the older, by now abandoned Anglo-Saxon buildings, and the defences were strengthened with a new gate house and by raising the height of the curtain wall. William I retired to become a monk in the 1130s, and his son William II had passed control of the castle to William III by the late 1140s. William III became embroiled in the dispute between Henry II and the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, during the 1160s. Despite being an ally of Becket, William argued with him over the appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> to Eynsford's church and was excommunicated for a period as a consequence.|$|E
