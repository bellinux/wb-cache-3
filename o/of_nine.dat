5000|$|The rule <b>of</b> <b>nines</b> was {{designed}} for adult patients. It is less accurate in young children due to their proportionally bigger heads and smaller mass in the legs and thighs, although one study did find it was accurate for patients as small as 10 kg. [...] To account for children's proportional differences, a [...] "rule <b>of</b> <b>nines</b> for children" [...] was proposed. [...] The head is assigned 18% BSA while each leg is 13.5%. The remainder of the body parts retain the same BSA percentages used in the adult rule <b>of</b> <b>nines.</b>|$|R

50|$|If the {{projective}} {{plane is}} non-Desarguesian, {{the removal of}} different lines could result in non-isomorphic affine planes. For instance, there are exactly four projective planes <b>of</b> order <b>nine,</b> and seven affine planes <b>of</b> order <b>nine.</b> There is only one affine plane corresponding to the Desarguesian plane <b>of</b> order <b>nine</b> since the collineation group of that projective plane acts transitively on {{the lines of the}} plane. Each of the three non-Desarguesian planes <b>of</b> order <b>nine</b> have collineation groups having two orbits on the lines, producing two non-isomorphic affine planes <b>of</b> order <b>nine,</b> depending on which orbit the line to be removed is selected from.|$|R
