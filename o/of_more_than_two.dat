5|$|Arthur Rose Eldred (August 16, 1895 – January 4, 1951) was an American {{agricultural}} and railroad industry executive, civic leader, {{and the first}} Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). As a 16-year-old candidate for the highest rank bestowed by the BSA, he was personally interviewed by a panel composed of the youth organization's founding luminaries, including Ernest Thompson Seton and Daniel Carter Beard. Eldred was awarded the coveted distinction of Eagle Scout on September 2, 1912, becoming the first <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> million boys in the U.S. since then to earn Scouting's most vaunted rank. Eldred also received the Bronze Honor Medal for lifesaving, {{and was the first}} of four generations of Eagle Scouts in his family.|$|E

5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because he was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods {{arboretum}} {{was started}} in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit {{on a smaller scale}} and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland {{was one of}} the Allied Powers {{during the}} First World War of 1914–1918, {{fighting}} against the Central Powers (the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Bulgaria). The state's armed forces were reorganised—the war marked the creation of the Royal Air Force, for example—and increased in size because of the introduction, in January 1916, of conscription {{for the first time in}} the kingdom's history as well as the raising of what was, at the time, the largest all-volunteer army in history, known as Kitchener's Army, <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> million men. The outbreak of war has generally been regarded as a socially unifying event, although this view has been challenged by more recent scholarship. In any case, responses in Great Britain in 1914 were similar to those amongst populations across Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} bridge in Cubzac is taken by Napoleon Bonaparte on 30 January 1812 and February 3, 1813. The bridge was originally {{to be completed in}} 1820. However, Cubzac's first bridge was a suspension bridge for which construction works started in 1834, under Louis-Philippe I. Works lasted four years, and public inauguration occurred on August 17, 1839 by the Duc and Duchesse of Orleans. The bridge had cost an estimated 3 million gold francs, was 545m long and had 5 bays. Shortly after its construction, the pillars sank about one metre. During its 30 years of existence, it withstood storms despite the large amplitude oscillations caused. However, on March 2, 1869 a large storm, causing oscillations <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> metres, partially destroyed the bridge and rendered it useless. Ancient methods to cross the Dordogne where reinstated. At first, barges and steamboats were used. Then, starting from October 1870, a large steam tub was used, measuring 21m by 13m. To cover the expensive construction costs, a toll was levied for the first 27 years.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} {{to promote the}} Sino-Roman connection for tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, {{on the grounds that}} it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. DNA testing in 2005 confirmed the Indo-European ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the Yuezhi and Wusun. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the Han Chinese populace and great deviation from the Western Eurasian gene pool. The researchers conclude that the people of Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of Roman presence.|$|E
