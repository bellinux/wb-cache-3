40|$|During 2004 - 06 Bolivia {{experienced}} a five-fold increase in oil revenues due to tax/ contractual innovations, higher prices and larger volumes {{at the same}} time that a multi-lateral debt reduction initiative trimmed roughly one third of the public external debt. The political economy setting of this environment entails a new hydrocarbons law that automatically decentralize expenditure to local governments and nationalization of the oil industry. This paper presents a model of fiscal dynamics in Bolivia in a stochastic framework and finds that the new status-quo will generate double reversions of primary surplus and a public debt path that may fall short of being pleasant in the presence of unfettered fiscal spending and/or decline in international energy prices and gas demand from its neighbors. The authors conclude that governance of the process of allocations and distribution of the oil rent is essential to the short to medium term sustainability of the new Bolivian model.

Executive Directors {{expressed concern about the}} continued weakness in economic policy performance, macroeconomic management, and governance. The authorities agreed that Equatorial Guinea's medium-term economic outlook was favorable, provided that sound economic management was put in place and maintained. The macroeconomic stability needed to be complemented by a number of structural reforms to foster non-oil growth. The recently established government-owned oil company (GEPETROL) has initiated some operations.

The external current account surplus remained large, even though average oil prices declined by 12. 6 percent to US$ 23. 78 per barrel, {{leading to a}} loss in oil export receipts equivalent to 5 percent of GDP.

40|$|This Selected Issues {{paper on}} Belize reviews the {{external}} competitiveness, balance sheet currency mismatch, and public sector debt. Belize is a small, open economy and {{highly dependent on}} external trade. Real wages {{in the private sector}} have increased only slightly. Belize’s exports of commodities grew strongly in volume terms during the last 10 years. The currency mismatch and liquidity pressures point to a growing exchange rate risk. Belize would have to maintain a significant primary fiscal surplus to reduce indebtedness over the medium term.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{cross-country}} incidence {{and severity of}} the 2008 - 2009 global recession is systematically related to pre-crisis macroeconomic and financial factors. We find that the pre-crisis level of development, increases in the ratio of private credit to GDP, current account deficits, and openness to trade are helpful in understanding {{the intensity of the}} crisis. International risk sharing did little to shield domestic demand from the country-specific component of output declines, while those countries with large pre-crisis current account deficits saw domestic demand fall by much more than domestic output during the crisis.
