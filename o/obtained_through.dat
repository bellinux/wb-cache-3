5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy.

5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E

5|$|Wealth is {{interpreted}} in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity {{is governed by}} laws, while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, at his own expense he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed as a guide to the sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that Grinsell had <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 {{per square foot}} ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction.|$|E

He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion.

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are <b>obtained</b> <b>through</b> the {{consumption}} of foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
