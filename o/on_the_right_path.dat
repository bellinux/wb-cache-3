5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>path,</b> the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of}} the game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E

There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge.

Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>path</b> to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E

In 60AH (680AD), Hussein left Medina for Mecca {{with a small group of}} companions and family members to travel to Kufa. He sent his cousin, Muslim, on ahead to make his decision after the advice of his cousin. But, by the time Hussein arrived near Kufa, his cousin had been killed. On the way , Hussein and his group were intercepted. They were forced into a detour and arrived in Karbala on the 2nd of Muharram, 61AH.

5000|$|Another {{category}} of multipass cells is generally {{referred to as}} circular multipass reflection cells. They were first introduced by Thoma and co-workers in 1994. [...] Such cells rely on a circular arrangement of spherical mirrors. Either, multiple spherical mirrors are positioned on a circle in a concentric arrangement, or only a single, circular mirror is used, where the mirror surface {{is at the same}} time the body of the cell. The beam enters the cell under an angle and propagates on a star-shaped pattern (see picture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right).</b> <b>The</b> <b>path</b> length in circular multipass cells can be varied by adjusting the incidence angle of the beam. An advantage lies in their robustness towards mechanical stress such as vibrations or temperature changes. Furthermore, circular multipass cells stand out because of the small detection volumes they provide. A drawback of this cell is the inherent concentric mirror arrangement which leads to imperfect imaging after a large number of reflections.|$|R

6000|$|The {{movements}} of {{expression in the}} face and body, whatever their origin may have been, are in themselves of much importance for our welfare. They serve as the first means of communication between the mother and her infant; she smiles approval, and thus encourages her child <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>path,</b> or frowns disapproval. We readily perceive sympathy in others by their expression; our sufferings are thus mitigated and our pleasures increased; and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened. The {{movements of}} expression give vividness and energy to our spoken words. They reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do words, which may be falsified. Whatever amount of truth the so-called science of physiognomy may contain, appears to depend, as Haller long ago remarked,[4] on different persons bringing into frequent use different facial muscles, according to their dispositions; the development of these muscles being perhaps thus increased, and the lines or furrows on the face, due to their habitual contraction, being thus rendered deeper and more conspicuous. The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression, as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions.[5] He who gives way to violent gestures will increase his rage; he who does not control the signs of fear will experience fear in a greater degree; and he who remains passive when overwhelmed with grief loses his best chance of recovering elasticity of mind. These results follow partly from the intimate relation which exists between almost all the emotions and their outward manifestations; and partly from the direct influence of exertion on the heart, and consequently on the brain. Even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our minds. Shakespeare, who from his wonderful knowledge of the human mind ought to be an excellent judge, says:-- ...|$|E

And so there they are hospitably received by the comely woman, with one child in her arms and another prattling and tottering at her gown, and drink some syrup of quince in the back parlour, with a map of the forest on the wall, and some prints of love-affairs and the great Napoleon hunting. As they draw near the Quadrilateral, and hear once more the report of the big guns, they take a by-road to avoid the sentries, and go on a while somewhat vaguely, with the sound of the cannon in their ears and the rain beginning to fall. The ways grow wider and sandier; here and there there are real sand hills, as though by the seashore; the fir-wood is open and grows in clumps upon the hillocks, and the race of sign-posts is no more. One begins to look at the other doubtfully. [...] "I am sure we should keep more to the right," [...] says one; and the other is just as certain they should hold to the left. And now, suddenly, the heavens open, and the rain falls [...] "sheer and strong and loud," [...] as out of a shower-bath. In a moment they are as wet as shipwrecked sailors. They cannot see out of their eyes for the drift, and the water churns and gurgles in their boots. They leave the track and try across country with a gambler's desperation, for it seems as if it were impossible to make the situation worse; and, for the next hour, go scrambling from boulder to boulder, or plod along paths that are now no more than rivulets, and across waste clearings where the scattered shells and broken fir-trees tell all too plainly of the cannon in the distance. And meantime the cannon grumble out responses to the grumbling thunder. There is such a mixture of melodrama and sheer discomfort about all this, it is at once so grey and so lurid, that it is far more agreeable to read and write about by the chimney-corner than to suffer in the person.
