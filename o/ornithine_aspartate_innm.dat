40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of {{metabolic}} syndrome and the development of liver failure in patients with this disease. The authors provide evidence about the advisability of administration to such patients of combined medication — <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> (original <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> Hepa-Merz produced by Merz Pharma GmbH & Co.). Efficiency of Hepa-Merz manifests by a decrease in hepatocyte cytolysis, normalization of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as positive effects on the clinical presentation of hepatic encephalopathy...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the changes in potassium homeostasis elicited by the cationic amino acids could be due to the effect of the chloride ions associated to the cationic amino acids, when they are administered under the hydrochloride form to improve solubility (Luiking and Deutz 2007). The results of the present study, showing that the administration of <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> to mice produced similar decrease in potassium levels in pancreas and liver than when ornithine was given under the hydrochloride form, makes unlikely the possibility that chloride could be the responsible of the decrease of the potassium content in these organs. However, the smaller increase in plasma potassium concentration observed, when <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> was administered, suggests that chloride ions may exert a negative effect on renal potassium secretion, and hence that the administration of the aspartate form of cationic amino acids could be safer than the one of chloride forms.|$|R
40|$|Aim: to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate,</b> probiotic Bioflorum Forte and their combination with steatosis and steatohepatitis in patients  with alcohol and non-alcoholic  fatty  liver disease. Materials and methods.   An open, randomized,  comparative  clinical study, which included 30 outpatients and inpatients with a diagnosis of steatosis, steatohepatitis. We analyzed the clinical symptoms, functional state of the liver. With the help of questionnaires  (Grids LeGo and post intoxication alcohol syndrome) have established the presence of chronic alcohol intoxication. Test transmissions of numbers used to characterize the cognitive function, as well as detection  of minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Quality of life was assessed by questionnaire for patients with chronic liver disease — CLDQ (The chronic liver disease questionnaire). The duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Results: all three treatment regimens have demonstrated therapeutic  efficacy: clinical improvement, recovery of liver function and results in cognitive function. When combined therapy also produced a significant improvement  in patients’ quality of life. It is shown that  the safety and tolerability of the means employed, adverse events were not reported. Conclusion: the results obtained allow us to recommend the use of <b>ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> (Hepa-Merz), both as monotherapy {{and as part of}} complex therapy of steatosis,  steatohepatitis with probiotic Bioflorum Forte in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the hepatoprotective activity of L-ornithine-L-aspartate against thioacetamide (TAA) -induced hepataopathy in rats. Materials and Methods: The hepatoprotective activity of L-ornithine-L-aspartate (OA) at {{a dose of}} 2 g/kg, p. o. for 10 days was evaluated against TAA (250 mg/kg, i. p. for 2 days) induced hepatopathy in rats. Biochemical parameters such as serum aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and protein in liver tissues were estimated to assess the liver function. Results: TAA-induced pathogenic changes in the levels of the above indices were significantly (P < 0. 01) reversed by the OA treatment. OA treatment also exhibited significant restoration of the hepatic architecture and lobular structure in histological evaluation of the rat liver sections. Conclusion: <b>Ornithine</b> <b>aspartate</b> exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity against TAA-induced hepatic damage in rats...|$|R
40|$|A {{glutamate}} dehydrogenase specific for nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide has been purified 50 -fold from Apodachlya brachynema (Leptomitales). Certain physical, chemical, and kinetic properties of this enzyme have been studied, particularly specificity for coenzymes and substrates. With glucose {{as the sole}} carbon source, the synthesis of {{glutamate dehydrogenase}} was repressed, whereas glutamate, proline, alanine, or <b>ornithine</b> plus <b>aspartate</b> as sole carbon sources induced synthesis of the enzyme. These data indicate that the function of this enzyme is primarily degradative, {{although there is no}} evidence for a nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate-specific biosynthetic glutamate dehydrogenase in Apodachlya...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli K 12 {{either of}} the two genes argF and argI is able to produce a {{functional}} ornithine carbamoyltransferase. When both are active in the same cell the two gene products interact to form a family of four hybrid trimeric isoenzymes of undistinguishable molecular weights, a situation presently unique in bacteria where very little genetic redundancy seems to occur. In E. coli B and W only the I gene product is found. Evolutionary implications of the structure and the genetic control of <b>ornithine</b> and <b>aspartate</b> carbamoyltransferase are discussed.

40|$|A N-lambda {{bacteriophage}} transducing {{the structural}} genes for Escherichia coli K- 12 carbamoylphosphate synthase (glutamine) (CPSase; EC 2. 7. 2. 9) has been isolated and analyzed both genetically and physically.

40|$|We have cloned a DNA {{complementary}} to {{the messenger}} RNA encoding the precursor of ornithine transcarbamylase from rat liver. This complementary DNA contains the entire protein coding region of 1062 nucleotides and 86 nucleotides of 5 '- and 298 nucleotides of 3 '-untranslated sequences. The predicted {{amino acid sequence}} has been confirmed by extensive protein sequence data. The mature rat enzyme contains {{the same number of}} amino acid residues (322) as the human enzyme and their amino acid sequences are 93 % homologous. The rat and human amino-terminal leader sequences of 32 amino acids, on the other hand, are only 69 % homologous. The rat leader contains no acidic and seven basic residues compared to four basic residues found in the human leader. There is complete sequence homology (residues 58 - 62) among the <b>ornithine</b> and <b>aspartate</b> transcarbamylases from E. coli and the rat and human ornithine transcarbamylases at the carbamyl phosphate binding site. Finally, a cysteine containing hexapeptide (residues 268 - 273), the putative ornithine binding site in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium, and bovine transcarbamylases, is completely conserved among the two E. coli and the two mammalian transcarbamylases...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} ruminant gut tissues have the capability to synthesize urea in a short-term incubation. Mixed primary cell cultures containing ruminal epithelial (REC) or duodenal muco-sal cells (DMC) were isolated from growing sheep (n = 4) fed a mixed forage-concentrate diet. Cells were incu-bated (90 min) in a Krebs salts-based buffer with either acetate (5 mM) or propionate (5 mM) plus a combination of substrate intermediates (5 mM) for urea synthesis: arginine, aspartate + citrulline (AspC), aspartate + or-nithine + ammonia (AspON), or AspON + N-carbamo-ylglutamate (AspONG) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments. Volatile fatty acid, propionate vs. ace-tate, did not influence net urea synthesis. For REC, net urea synthesis (nmoles(106 cells) − 190 min− 1) was greatest with Arg (54. 5 ± 6. 3) followed by AspC (4. 6 ± 1. 1) and AspONG (3. 6 ± 1. 4). For DMC, net urea synthe-sis for Arg (2. 1 ± 0. 7) andAspONG (1. 9 ± 0. 7) treatments was greater than for AspC (0. 3 ± 0. 7) and AspON (− 0. 6 ± 0. 7) treatments. Thus, for both REC andDMC, arginase activity appeared to be sufficient for catabolism of argi-nine to urea. Furthermore, greater urea synthesis from ammonia, <b>ornithine</b> and <b>aspartate</b> in the presence of theN-acetylglutamate analogue suggests that carbam-oyl phosphate synthetase is probably rate-limiting for urea synthesis and ammonia detoxification by rumi-nant gut tissues.

40|$|When 5 -mm maize root tips were excised {{and placed}} in an {{inorganic}} salts solution for 6 hours, there was a loss of alcohol-insoluble nitrogen. The levels of threonine, proline, valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and lysine in the alcohol soluble fraction were severely reduced, whereas those of glutamate, <b>aspartate,</b> <b>ornithine,</b> and alanine were scarcely affected. There was a 4 -fold {{increase in the level}} of γ-aminobutyrate. Those amino acids whose synthesis appeared to be deficient in excised root tips also showed poor incorporation of acetate carbon. In addition, the results show that asparagine and the amino acids of the neutral and basic fraction were preferentially transported to the root tip region. The results therefore suggest that the synthesis of certain amino acids in the root tip region is restricted, and that this requirement for amino acids in the growing region could regulate the flow of amino acids to the root tip...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic {{plants of}} Nicotiana tabacum L. {{homozygous}} for an RNAi construct designed to silence ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) had significantly lower concentrations of nicotine and nornicotine, but significantly higher concentrations of anatabine, compared with vector-only controls. Silencing of ODC {{also led to}} significantly reduced concentrations of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine), tyramine and phenolamides (caffeoylputrescine and dicaffeoylspermidine) with concomitant increases in concentrations of amino acids <b>ornithine,</b> arginine, <b>aspartate,</b> glutamate and glutamine. Root transcript levels of S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase, S-adenosyl methionine synthase and spermidine synthase (polyamine synthesis enzymes) were reduced compared with vector controls, whilst transcript levels of arginine decarboxylase (putrescine synthesis), putrescine methyltransferase (nicotine production) and multi-drug and toxic compound extrusion (alkaloid transport) proteins were elevated. In contrast, expression of two other key proteins required for alkaloid synthesis, quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (nicotinic acid production) and a PIP-family oxidoreductase (nicotinic acid condensation reactions), were diminished in roots of odc-RNAi plants relative to vector-only controls. Transcriptional and biochemical differences associated with polyamine and alkaloid metabolism were exacerbated in odc-RNAi plants in response to different forms of shoot damage. In general, apex removal had a greater effect than leaf wounding alone, {{with a combination of}} these injury treatments producing synergistic responses in some cases. Reduced expression of ODC appeared to have negative effects upon plant growth and vigour with some leaves of odc-RNAi lines being brittle and bleached compared with vector-only controls. Together, results of this study demonstrate that ornithine decarboxylase has important roles in facilitating both primary and secondary metabolism in Nicotiana...|$|R
40|$|Administration {{of either}} ammonia or glycine to both {{rats and mice}} results in an {{increased}} synthesis in the liver and urinary excretion of orotic acid. The two most relevant observations obtained are that carbamoyl phosphate synthesized inside the mitochondria {{is involved in the}} increased synthesis of orotic acid and that this latter process is almost completely abolished by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis. Orotic acid synthesis could be controlled by an induction-suppression mechanism. Inhibition of synthesis of excess orotic acid brought about by N-(phosphonacetyl) -L-aspartic acid but not by acivicin, suggests that glutamine-dependent cytosolic synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate, is not involved. Administration of ornithine together with glycine completely suppressed the synthesis of orotic acid, but promoted a twofold increase of urea excretion. The concentration of ornithine rather than that of carbamoyl phosphate or the activity of the enzymes involved, may represent a limiting factor controlling both the flux of ammonia in the urea cycle and the availability of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate for orotic acid synthesis. Two enzymes {{have been found to be}} induced by glycine: <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase and <b>aspartate</b> transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase). Both enzymes may contribute to the increase in orotic acid synthesis, aspartate transcarbamoylase more directly and ornithine decarboxylase by lowering the ornithine concentration. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was completely suppressed but that of aspartate transcarbamoylase was further increased by cycloheximide treatment. Inhibition of orotic acid biosynthesis by cycloheximide appears to be the result of a decreased availability in the cytosol of carbamoyl phosphate synthesized inside the mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|Transcarbamylases {{catalyze}} {{the transfer}} of the carbamyl group from carbamyl phosphate (CP) to an amino group of a second substrate such as <b>aspartate,</b> <b>ornithine,</b> or putrescine. Previously, structural determination of a transcarbamylase from Xanthomonas campestris led to the discovery of a novel N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase (AOTCase) that catalyzes the carbamylation of N-acetylornithine. Recently, a novel N-succinylornithine transcarbamylase (SOTCase) from Bacteroides fragilis was identified. Structural comparisons of AOTCase from X. campestris and SOTCase from B. fragilis revealed that residue Glu 92 (X. campestris numbering) plays a critical role in distinguishing AOTCase from SOTCase. Enzymatic assays of E 92 P, E 92 S, E 92 V, and E 92 A mutants of AOTCase demonstrate that each of these mutations converts the AOTCase to an SOTCase. Similarly, the P 90 E mutation in B. fragilis SOTCase (equivalent to E 92 in X. campestris AOTCase) converts the SOTCase to AOTCase. Hence, a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to swap the substrate specificities of AOTCase and SOTCase. X-ray crystal structures of these mutants in complexes with CP and N-acetyl-L-norvaline (an analog of N-acetyl-L-ornithine) or N-succinyl-L-norvaline (an analog of N-succinyl-L-ornithine) substantiate this conversion. In addition to Glu 92 (X. campestris numbering), other residues such as Asn 185 and Lys 30 in AOTCase, which are involved in binding substrates through bridging water molecules, help to define the substrate specificity of AOTCase. These results provide the correct annotation (AOTCase or SOTCase) for a set of the transcarbamylase-like proteins that have been erroneously annotated as ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase, EC 2. 1. 3. 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The urea cycle {{functions}} to incorporate ammonia, generated by normal metabolism, into urea. Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) {{are caused by}} loss of function {{in any of the}} enzymes responsible for ureagenesis, and are characterized by life-threatening episodes of acute metabolic decompensation with hyperammonemia (HA). A prospective analysis of interim HA events in a cohort of individuals with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, the most common UCD, revealed that intercurrent infection was the most common precipitant of acute HA and was associated with markers of increased morbidity when compared with other precipitants. To further understand these clinical observations, we developed a model system of metabolic decompensation with HA triggered by viral infection (PR 8 influenza) using spf-ash mice, a model of OTC deficiency. Both wild-type (WT) and spf-ash mice displayed similar cytokine profiles and lung viral titers in response to PR 8 influenza infection. During infection, spf-ash mice displayed an increase in liver transaminases, suggesting a hepatic sensitivity to the inflammatory response and an altered hepatic immune response. Despite having no visible pathological changes by histology, WT and spf-ash mice had reduced CPS 1 and OTC enzyme activities, and, unlike WT, spf-ash mice failed to increase ureagenesis. Depression of urea cycle function was seen in liver amino acid analysis, with reductions seen in <b>aspartate,</b> <b>ornithine</b> and arginine during infection. In conclusion, we developed a model system of acute metabolic decompensation due to infection in a mouse model of a UCD. In addition, we have identified metabolic perturbations during infection in the spf-ash mice, including a reduction of urea cycle intermediates. This model of acute metabolic decompensation with HA due to infection in UCD serves as a platform for exploring biochemical perturbations and the efficacy of treatments, and could be adapted to explore acute decompensation in other types of inborn errors of metabolism...|$|R
