5|$|Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> signatories emigrated. Jurgis Šaulys and Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys died in Switzerland. Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Biržiška, and Steponas Kairys {{emigrated to}} the United States and are buried there.|$|E

5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} {{during this phase}} of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.|$|E
5|$|At 02:30 {{a second}} wave of about 150 to 200 Japanese troops again {{attacked}} across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out. At least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> Imperial officers from this attack advised Ichiki to withdraw his remaining forces, but Ichiki declined to do so.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> {{aircraft}} {{had been}} withdrawn from combat units. After the war, some were modified as transports for important officials, and a few others were used in various Soviet testing programs. Some supported the Soviet Arctic operations until the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and {{captured}} more than 60,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survived</b> local people as slaves. Many districts including Vagharshapat were depopulated under <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Timurid Empire.|$|R

5|$|For its actions, the West German {{government}} was criticised by Israel and other parties, {{in some cases}} combined with allegations that the hijacking had been staged or at least tolerated with theories of a secret agreement between the German government and Black September Organization - release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on Germany.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Book <b>of</b> Urizen {{was printed}} from 1794 until 1818 and {{was larger than}} his America, A Prophecy. Only eight copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work <b>survive,</b> with many {{variations}} between them <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate orders and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> plates. All <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> copies were colour-printed.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, the BBC Two arts {{magazine}} programme The Late Show {{produced an}} edition which featured a retrospective of Cartier's work, {{including a new}} interview with the director discussing his career. This feature was repeated on BBC Two under the title Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer on 1 July 1994, followed by a tribute screening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> telerecording copy of the second performance of Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|In July, three {{associates}} of Berkman—Charles Berg, Arthur Caron, and Carl Hanson—began collecting dynamite and storing {{it at the}} apartment of another conspirator, Louise Berger. Some sources, including Charles Plunkett, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> conspirators, say that Berkman was the chief conspirator, {{the oldest and most}} experienced member of the group. Berkman denied any involvement or knowledge of the plan.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> frescoes on the church's {{interior}} walls {{date from the}} 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, all painted {{as part of the}} church's first reconstruction. However, restoration works carried out in the 2000s have uncovered 14th-century murals depicting the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary as well as John the Baptist.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> {{last quarter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th century, the Ağ Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, {{including}} Yerevan.

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{surviving}}</b> prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor {{are located}} on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason {{it is likely that}} the surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> sections {{are protected}} as scheduled monuments: the Flodden Wall at Granny's Green; the Flodden and Telfer Walls at the Vennel and Heriot Place; and the Flodden Wall at Drummond Place and Pleasance. The walling in Tweeddale Court and the sections within Greyfriars Kirkyard are protected as listed buildings. The walls also {{form part of}} the Edinburgh Old Town World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{folk music}} of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid-20th century. It cannot {{be separated from}} the musical traditions of continental Europe, and the majority of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants, particularly in France. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> traditional songs are in French, with a minority in Jèrriais.|$|E

5|$|After {{his victory}} at Hastings, William {{expected}} {{to receive the}} submission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> English leaders, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, {{with the support of}} Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of Kent to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark, but being unable to storm London Bridge he sought to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to {{all parts of the}} building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E
