It could save production cost to <b>ordinary</b> <b>loom</b> used to weave 3 D fabrics and controllability of fabrics was good. The fabric was used as enhance phase, 307 - 3 polyester resin was used as matrix, and VARTM process was used in making 3 D honey comb basalt fibers woven composites. The composites can overcome the shortcomings such as poor integrity, easy to be cracked, low interlaminar strength and easy to be damaged. This study provides theoretical guidance for 3 D textile composites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the <b>ordinary</b> <b>loom,</b> the 3 D {{woven fabrics}} like the orthogonal/connected {{stitching}} structure, angle Alliance/interlocked stitching structure by the reasonable transformation, weaving diagram and looming draft, have been woven in this paper. Using <b>ordinary</b> <b>loom</b> weaving fabrics, {{it would not}} only save the cost of production, but also has good controllability of woven fabrics. Good structural design and integrity of the 3 D woven fabrics, own tight fabric structure, superior mechanical properties, low price, and broad application prospects. The results shows that this design would give a basis for further study on the development perform of 3 D textile structural composite materials...|$|E

40|$|To {{refer to}} the Jacquard loom as a {{precursor}} of the computer is a common narrative in histories of computing beginning with Ada Lovelace comparing the punched card operated loom with the calculating engine designed by Charles Babbage: “We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves. ” But {{this does not mean}} that Jacquard invented the algebra of patterns. He only constructed the first widely known and used mechanism replacing the drawboy by punched cards to feed pattern information into his mechanism. To control a weave means to decide whether a warp thread is to be picked up or not. Weaving has therefore been a binary art from its very beginning, applying operations of pattern algebra for millennia. Jacquard’s cards were the end of this story rather than its beginning, reducing the weaver to an operator who had to step on a single treadle repeatedly. This article argues that algebra is already involved in operating shafts or heddles on <b>ordinary</b> <b>looms,</b> that this algebra was applied tacitly until the first weaving notations were developed, and that these notations make the tacit algebra of patterns recognizable to non-weavers: inventors and engineers...|$|R

25|$|The {{hand loom}} with {{jacquard}} is a wooden hand loom {{typical of the}} many thousands of looms {{that were used in}} the domestic cottage industry throughout the British Isles. They were gradually replaced by all-metal looms (see the Hattersley domestic loom) and new methods of working practice, such as the factory system, during the Industrial Revolution. The loom has a four-shuttle drop box to weave up to four colours of weft, and has John Kay's flying shuttle method of inserting the weft. Most of the handlooms used in the home were <b>ordinary</b> shaft <b>looms.</b> These do not require roof space and would be weaving standard cloths, unlike this loom which is fitted with a 360 hook de Vogue jacquard and can weave very complex fabrics.|$|R
