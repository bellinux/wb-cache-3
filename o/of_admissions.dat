5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that, as of 2010, 880,000 deaths {{occur as}} a result of self-harm. About 10% <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> to medical wards in the UK are {{as a result of}} self-harm, the majority of which are drug overdoses. However, studies based only on hospital admissions may hide the larger group of self-harmers who do not need or seek hospital treatment for their injuries, instead treating themselves. Many adolescents who present to general hospitals with deliberate self-harm report previous episodes for which they did not receive medical attention. In the United States up to 4% of adults self-harm with approximately 1% of the population engaging in chronic or severe self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Admission to Baltimore City College is {{selective}} but {{is open to}} residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding counties in the metropolitan area, though non-Baltimore City residents must pay tuition. Applicants must meet all requirements for promotion to ninth grade, {{as determined by the}} Maryland State Department of Education. Additionally, applicants must earn a minimum composite score of 610, calculated by Baltimore City Public Schools. Generally, candidates for admissiom must have a 3.0 overall numeric grade average (B letter grade; 80 or better percentage grade), have at least a 3.0 average in both Mathematics and English, rank in the 65th percentile or better among all Maryland students in Math and English on the Maryland School Assessment (MSA), and have 90% or better attendance rate. Due to the highly competitive nature of the City College admissions process, successful applicants typically exceed the aforementioned minimums. J.D.

40|$|Objective: To know {{effect of}} hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) {{at the time}} <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> in {{patients}} with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. Methods: this cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Neurosurgery department, BSMMU to observe effect of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on GCS at the time <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> in patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. The duration of study period was from November 2005 to April 2007. Results: a total 48 patients were included in the study and the variables that were analyzed included site of hematoma, volume of hematoma, perihematomal edema and the initial GCS score. Associations between the hematoma and perihematomal edema, site of hemorrhage and perihematomal edema, hematoma volume and GCS at the time <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> perihematomal edema volume and GCS at the time <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> were evaluated.

5|$|In June 1919, {{soon after}} the passage of Education Act 1918, the school {{successfully}} applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number <b>of</b> <b>admissions.</b> In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Jungle Book was {{released}} in October 1967, just 10 months after Walt's death. Some copies were in a double feature with Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar. Produced on a budget of $4 million, the film was a massive success, finishing 1967 as the fourth highest-grossing movie of the year. The Jungle Book was re-released theatrically in North America three times, 1978, 1984, and 1990, and also in Europe throughout the 1980s. The total gross is $141 million in the United States and $205 million worldwide. The North American total, after adjustments for inflation, {{is estimated to be}} the 29th highest-grossing film of all time in the United States. An estimated $108 million alone came from Germany making it the third highest-grossing film of all time there only behind Avatar ($137 million) and Titanic ($125 million).
