5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E
40|$|Aims There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} into the prevalence of Complex PTSD, however what is as of yet unclear is whether Complex PTSD is a result <b>of</b> multiple <b>traumas,</b> or a consequence <b>of</b> <b>traumas</b> occurring at a young age. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of age at first trauma and the number <b>of</b> <b>traumas</b> experienced on symptoms of Complex PTSD. Method Seventy-two individuals with PTSD were recruited from three mental health outpatient services. Participants were administered standardised measures regarding their experiences of traumatic events (THQ) and symptoms of PTSD (PCL) and Complex PTSD (DES, SDQ- 5, IIP- 25 and BDI-II). Results Age at first trauma was shown to effect interpersonal problems, with the childhood trauma group displaying increased symptoms once the number <b>of</b> <b>traumas</b> experienced was controlled for. Age at first trauma was not related to dissociation, somatisation, PTSD severity or depression. In contrast, the number <b>of</b> <b>traumas</b> experienced was related to PTSD severity, interpersonal problems, dissociation, somatisation and depression. Conclusion The results suggest that the experience <b>of</b> multiple <b>traumas</b> may lead to symptoms of Complex PTSD. With the exception of interpersonal problems, the study suggests that Complex PTSD is a response to the cumulative effect <b>of</b> multiple <b>traumas,</b> rather than a response to traumas occurring in childhood...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{to study}} and {{experimentally}} test effectiveness of application of stretching as auxiliary not specific component of complex rehabilitation of football players with <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> limbs. Material: experiment covered 186 sportsmen of 14 - 17 years old age. Quantitative indicators <b>of</b> limbs’ <b>traumas</b> and damages were registered in competition and training processes during yearly macro-cycle by results of processing of official competitions’ records and by medical records of football players.

5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history <b>of</b> <b>trauma,</b> including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding as a result <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>trauma,</b> during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E

During 1996 - 2010, the incidence rates <b>of</b> hospitalized eye <b>trauma</b> (per 100 000 person-years) were 35. 0 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 34. 0 to 36. 0) for total diagnosis, 9. 8 (95 % CI, 9. 3 to 10. 3) for a principal diagnosis, and 25. 3 (95 % CI, 24. 4 to 26. 1) for a secondary diagnosis. The sex risk ratio was 3. 1 for a principal diagnosis and 2. 1 for a secondary diagnosis.
