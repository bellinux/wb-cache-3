5|$|Stephen Boyd {{was cast}} as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not cry <b>on</b> <b>cue.</b> Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.|$|E

40|$|Trivers’s {{theory of}} parental {{investment}} suggests that adults should {{decide whether or}} not to invest in a given infant using a cost-benefit analysis. To make the best investment decision, adults should seek as much relevant in-formation as possible. Infant facial cues may serve to provide information and evoke feelings of parental care in adults. Four specific infant facial cues were investigated: resemblance (as a proxy for kinship), health, happiness, and cuteness. It was predicted that these cues would influence feelings of parental care for both sexes, but that resemblance would be more important for men than women because of the importance of paternity uncertainty in the ancestral environment. Seventy-six men and 76 women participated in a hypothetical adoption task in which they made judgments of infant faces. Average zero-order, partial, and component score correlations all revealed that men placed primary emphasis <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> of resemblance, while women placed primary emphasis <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> of health and cuteness (cues of infant quality). The correlations also showed that men placed a significantly greater emphasis <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> of resemblance than did women...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the degree to which clients and counsellors rely on verbal and nonverbal cues in judging certain personal attributes of each other. It was predicted that clients would rely more <b>on</b> nonverbal <b>cues</b> than <b>on</b> verbal <b>cues</b> in judging the competence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness of counsellors, whereas counsellors would rely more <b>on</b> verbal <b>cues</b> than <b>on</b> nonverbal <b>cues</b> in judging the same attributes in clients. Thirty-two counsellors conducted a 20 -minute interview with 32 clients. Immediately following an interview, the counsellor and client independently judged each other's com-petence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness, and then indicated their reliance on verbal and nonverbal cues in judging these attributes. Verbal and nonverbal reliance scores were compared between the client and counsellor groups by a 2 x 3 x 2 (Group x Attribute x Reliance) analysis of variance. The results did not support the hypotheses. Both counsellors and clients appeared to rely more <b>on</b> verbal <b>cues</b> in judging competence, and <b>on</b> nonverbal <b>cues</b> in judging attractiveness and trustworthiness.

40|$|Cross-language {{differences}} {{in the use of}} coarticulatory cues for the identification of fricatives have been demonstrated in a phoneme detection task: Listeners with perceptually similar fricative pairs in their native phoneme inventories (English, Polish, Spanish) relied more <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> from vowels than listeners with perceptually more distinct fricative contrasts (Dutch and German). The present gating study further investigated these cross-language differences and addressed three questions. (1) Are there cross-language {{differences in}} informativeness of parts of the speech signal regarding place of articulation for fricative identification? (2) Are such cross-language differences fricative-specific, or do they extend to the perception of place of articulation for plosives? (3) Is such language-specific uptake of information based <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> preceding or following the consonantal constriction? Dutch, Italian, Polish, and Spanish listeners identified fricatives and plosives in gated CV and VC syllables. The results showed cross-language {{differences in the}} informativeness of coarticulatory cues for fricative identification: Spanish and Polish listeners extracted place of articulation information from shorter portions of VC syllables. No language-specific differences were found for plosives, suggesting that greater reliance <b>on</b> coarticulatory <b>cues</b> did not generalize to other phoneme types. The language-specific differences for fricatives were based <b>on</b> coarticulatory <b>cues</b> into the consonant...|$|R

25|$|The {{basis of}} {{effective}} clicker training is precise timing {{to deliver the}} conditioned reinforcer {{at the same moment}} as the desired behaviour is offered. The clicker is used as a 'bridge' between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by 'luring' where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by 'shaping' where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by 'capturing' where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded. Once a behaviour is learnt and is <b>on</b> <b>cue</b> (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.|$|E
25|$|The actor {{followed}} The Godfather with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance {{threatened to}} be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual {{content of the}} film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines <b>on</b> <b>cue</b> cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci {{with the problem of}} keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant and Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit, however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Although Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} prosody <b>on</b> the acoustic <b>cues</b> of stop consonants, based on speech from the Boston University Radio News corpus. An investigation of VOT, f 0, closure duration, burst amplitude and spectral characteristics provide evidence for a primary effect of accent (a level of phrasal prominence) on these measures as cues to stop voicing and/or place of articulation. There are robust, significant effects of accent <b>on</b> the acoustic <b>cues</b> for both voicing and place of articulation, exhibiting a general pattern of prosodic strengthening. However, the accent effect <b>on</b> voicing <b>cues</b> results in the enhancement of the phonological voice contrast, whereas the effect <b>on</b> acoustic <b>cues</b> to place of articulation does not similarly enhance the place contrast. Comparison of η 2 values shows that accent effects are strongest on those measures that are weak cues to the phonological contrast, and weakest on the measures that are strong cues. While there are no observed strengthening effects of phrasal position <b>on</b> voicing <b>cues</b> for /t/ and /d/, acoustic variability is reduced in phrase-initial position...|$|R
25|$|Wyler {{typically}} {{cast the}} Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore {{the divide between}} the two groups. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired {{after two days of}} work because she could not cry <b>on</b> <b>cue.</b> Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott (who had played the mother of Heston's Moses in The Ten Commandments, and with whom he'd worked on Broadway) as Miriam. Scott was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline (Ben-Hur would be her last screen performance) Wyler cast her as Tirzah. More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, primarily because he had become famous for his roles as a wise old patriarch in a number of films. Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar the same day as Jaffe. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Wyler's efforts at persuasion were successful, and Hawkins was cast on March 18, 1958. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the comical Sheik Ilderim. Finlay Currie had worked with Zimbalist before on Quo Vadis, playing St. Peter, was cast as Balthasar.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role and interplay of {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic cues when evaluating fish quality and in shaping consumers' attitudes toward fish consumption. A sensory analysis of nine different fish including five variants of barramundi was conducted to determine how consumers evaluated the fish <b>on</b> intrinsic <b>cues.</b> Focus groups were then conducted to explore the impact of extrinsic <b>cues</b> <b>on</b> attitudes and purchase intentions. While the sensory analysis revealed distinct differences between barramundi variants <b>on</b> intrinsic <b>cues</b> (notably taste), the focus groups revealed that, as a brand, barramundi is perceived much more favourably and consistently. Consumers used extrinsic cues, particularly country of origin, as surrogate indicators of quality.

40|$|The social {{organization}} of animals is reliant on recognition. However, the precision and specificity with {{which an individual}} animal recognizes another in a social context, and the sensory mechanisms that it employs, may vary both within and between species. Differences in the ecology and in the mating systems of species may drive the evolution of different recognition abilities, ranging from individual-specific recognition to more general forms of recognition. We examined social recognition in two important model species in behavioral ecology, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We found that guppies were capable of individual recognition of conspecifics, {{as well as being}} able to differentiate between groups of conspecific based <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> relating to resource use and habitat use. By contrast, sticklebacks showed no ability to recognize individuals in a social context after prior interactions. Nonetheless, two out of three populations of sticklebacks demonstrated general recognition abilities, based <b>on</b> <b>cues</b> relating to resource use. We discuss the potential relationship between social recognition mechanisms and the ecological and life-history parameters of species and populations.
