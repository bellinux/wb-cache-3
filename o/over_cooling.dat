50|$|Micro {{reactors}} can be tube or {{plates and}} have the key feature of small diameter flow channels (typically less than <1 mm). The significance of micro reactors is that the heat transfer area (A) per unit volume (of product) is very large. A large heat transfer area means that high values of qx can be achieved with low values of Tp - Tj. The low value of Tp - Tj limits the extent of <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> that can occur. Thus the product temperature can be controlled by regulating {{the temperature of the}} heat transfer fluid (or the product).|$|E

50|$|Registers vary in size {{with the}} {{heating and cooling}} {{requirements}} of the room. If a register is too small, the HVAC system will need to push air through the ducts {{at a faster rate}} in order to achieve the desired heating or cooling. This can create rushing sounds which can disturb occupants or interfere with conversation or work (such as sound recording). The velocity of air through a register is usually kept low enough so that it is masked by background noise. (Higher ambient levels of background noise, such as those in restaurants, allow for higher air velocities.) On the other hand, air velocity must be high enough to achieve the desired temperature. Registers are a critical part of the HVAC system. If not properly installed and tightly connected to the ductwork, air will spill around the register and greatly reduce the HVAC system's efficiency. Ideally, a room will have both heating and cooling registers. In practice, cost considerations usually require that heating and cooling be provided by the same register. In such cases, heating most often takes precedence <b>over</b> <b>cooling,</b> and registers are usually found close to the floor.|$|E

40|$|Installations with chill water cooling, needing {{constant}} {{air volume}} and dehumidification, traditionally use a draw through {{air handling unit}} with a cooling coil and a re-heat coil.

A properly controlled Face and Bypass unit can deliver the same air conditions by blending return air and cold deck air with no need for re-heat.

40|$|In recent years, {{cooling towers}} {{have become more}} popular in mega cities mainly because of their {{superior}} energy efficiency compared with air-cooled chillers. However, under specific environmental conditions, e. g. the humid air in Hong Kong or the calm wind inside compact built structure, exhausting plume often appears as saturated air (moisture) <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> towers that adversely affects the visual appearance of the premises. Moreover, visible moist plume arouses public concern due to the possible transport of contaminants or even harmful bacteria such as Legionnella. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study was performed to examine the mechanism of plume development <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> towers, the subsequent moisture transport and the resultant impact on the buildings nearby in a hypothetical dense urban environment. The velocity of the cooling tower exhaust is kept constant under different prevalent wind speed. This configuration examines the velocity ratio (v r) at 0. 33, 0. 83, 1. 53 and 2. 17 for atmospheric condition of light air, light breeze, gentle breeze and moderate breeze respectively. When the v r is 0. 83 and 2. 17 (light breeze), the short-circuiting can occur, in which a representative moisture content can reach up to 17. 5 and 17. 73 gM/kgDA respectively at different distance ratio. This indicates that the discharge air re-enters the cooling tower as some is trapped within the alley. Whilst, as v r increases to 1. 53 (gentle breeze), short-circuiting of cooling tower is reduced to approximately {{by an average of}} 0. 5 gM/kgDA for the specified distance ratio. This is due to the stronger upward draught that pushes the exhaust air further up yet still lingers within the alley. The CFD analysis shows that further increase in the prevalent wind speed suppresses the crosswind mixing of cooling tower exhaust, thus further reduces the chance of short-circuiting. This indicates the environment condition affects the severity of plume. More attention should be pay on the potential risk of public health. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The 13000 cfm 'emergency' {{vent fan}} must be {{protected}} from <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> which {{would result in a}} mechanical failure. <b>Over</b> <b>cooling</b> could result from a catastrophic cryogen release from the cryostat(s) or Argon Storage Dewar. In order to protect the fan, a VPT has been calibrated for - 31 C to open a switch which sends a signal to allow warm gas to enter the sump by means of a motor controlled louver installed at 'sidewalk level' in the ductwork between the assembly hall and the Argon Dewar Enclosure. The bulb of the VPT is enclosed in a thermal well and will be placed in the gas stream directly above the fan. The switching unit will be mounted nearby on the wall in order to isolate it from vibrational effects. Should the fan be activated due to a cryogen release, it should not experience any problems when operating above - 40 C. The switch was set and checked in a saturated calcium chloride solution cooled to - 31 C by running cold gaseous Nitrogen through a copper tube coiled in a dewar. Switching temperature was measured by a thermocouple tied to the VPT bulb. The thermocouple was checked in LN 2, in an ice water bath, and against an ordinary thermometer (which was assumed to be accurate to plus or minus 0. 3 C) at room temperature. The results are shown below in 'Table 1 ' By interpolation of the data, thermocouple error at - 31. 0 C was found to be 0. 43 C on the warm side. Since this error was small, it was ignored. 'Table 2 ' shows the results of the tests. Ten readings were taken with the switch wired in the 'normally open' mode. This results in a signal at room temperature. The worst deviation was 2. 5 C. Three readings were then taken from the 'normally closed' wiring arrangement (the way it will be wired for installation). The greatest deviation was 1. 2 C. The next day, the switch was checked five times wired in the 'normally open' configuration. The greatest error was 1. 1 C. A graph has been prepared showing the switching and resetting temperatures. The errors these tests bore out do not threaten the exhaust fan and are therefore acceptable...|$|E
40|$|In condensed-matter physics, {{remarkable}} {{advances have}} been made with atomic systems by establishing a thorough control <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> and trapping techniques. In semiconductors, this method may also provide a deterministic approach to reach the long standing goal of harnessing collective quantum phenomena with exciton gases. While long-lived excitons are simply cooled to very low temperatures using cryogenic apparatus, engineering confining potentials has been a challenging task. This degree of control was only achieved recently with devices realized by highly demanding nano-fabrication processes. Here, we demonstrate an alternative to this technology and show how a proper optical excitation allows to manipulate in-situ the exciton transport. Our approach {{is based on the}} optically controlled injection and spatial patterning of charges trapped in a field-effect device. Thus, electric field gradients are created and implement microscopic traps or anti-traps for the excitons dipole. Accordingly, any confinement geometry can be realized by shaping the spatial profile of a laser excitation. Hence, we succeed in trapping exciton gases in a density range where quantum correlations are predicted at our very low bath temperature. Comment: 6 pages and 8 figures including supplement...|$|E

The amount of heat that generated in the particular room is depend on several factors such as position of the room relative to solar orientation, wall material, electric appliances and number of human occupied in the room.

The method of heat gain determination is using Cooling Load Temperature Differential (CLTD) and Cooling Load Factors (CLF) based on ASHRAE 1997 Fundamental Handbook and then verified by data provided by contractor of building.

The present work is carried out in the framework of the European FP- 7 project EVOL (Evaluation and Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system). One of the project tasks is to report on safety analyses: calculations of reactor transients using various numerical codes for the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) under different boundary conditions, assumptions, and for different selected scenarios. Based on the original reference core geometry, an optimized geometry was proposed by Rouch et al. (2014. Ann. Nucl. Energy 64, 449) on thermal-hydraulic design aspects to avoid a recirculation zone near the blanket which accumulates heat and very high temperature exceeding the salt boiling point. Using both fully neutronics thermal-hydraulic coupled codes (SIMMER and COUPLE), we also re-confirm the efforts step by step toward a core geometry without the recirculation zone in particular as concerns the modifications of the core geometrical shape.

40|$|We {{address the}} thermal {{history of the}} Earth after the Moon-forming impact, taking tidal heating and thermal {{blanketing}} by the atmosphere into account. The atmosphere sets an upper bound of ~ 100 W/m^ 2 on how quickly the Earth can cool. The liquid magma ocean cools over 2 - 10 Myrs, with longer times corresponding to high angular-momentum events. Tidal heating is focused mostly in mantle materials that {{are just beginning to}} freeze. The atmosphere's control <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> sets up a negative feedback between viscosity-dependent tidal heating and temperature-dependent viscosity of the magma ocean. While the feedback holds, evolution of the Moon's orbit is limited by the modest radiative cooling rate of Earth's atmosphere. Orbital evolution is orders of magnitude slower than in conventional constant Q models, which promotes capture by resonances. The evection resonance is encountered early, when the Earth is molten. Capture by the evection resonance appears certain but unlikely to generate much eccentricity because it is encountered early when the Earth is molten and Q_Earth >> Q_Moon. Tidal dissipation in the Earth becomes more efficient (Q_Earth << Q_Moon) later when the Moon is between ~ 20 R_Earth and ~ 40 R_Earth. If lunar eccentricity grew great, this was when it did so, perhaps setting the table for some other process to leave its mark on the inclination of the Moon.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the likely effects on gas and electricity consumption and carbon emissions from {{heating and cooling}} systems in existing dwellings up to 2080, assuming a widespread uptake of cooling systems. This area of research is highly sensitive to the myriad of possible inputs and thus holds {{a wide range of}} predicted outcomes. However, general trends have been found, showing significant sensitivity to ventilation rate, U-values, occupant behaviour and location. Heating demand will still be dominant <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> demand in UK dwellings by the 2080 s, based on an UKCIP 02 A 1 F 1 weather scenario.

Practical applications: The balance of heating and cooling demand causes more modest changes in CO 2 than first anticipated. Despite first perceptions of future energy use in housing and climate change, heating appears to remain the major load rather than cooling, even into the 2080 s. These predictions of future CO 2 emissions will be useful to those in the building industry planning appropriate proportionate climate adaptation and climate mitigation measures. Also, the prediction of changes to future energy demands from the housing sector will be of interest to energy providers considering future demands for heating and cooling and may feed into larger bottom-up energy models...|$|E
40|$|As {{a planet}} ages it cools and its radius shrinks, {{at a rate}} set by the {{efficiency}} with which heat is transported from the interior out to space. The bottleneck for this trans-port is at {{the boundary between the}} convective interior and the radiative atmosphere; the opacity there sets the global cooling rate. Models of planetary evolution are often one-dimensional, such that the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is defined by a single temperature, pressure, and opacity. In reality the spatially inhomogenous stel-lar heating pattern and circulation in the atmosphere could deform the RCB, allowing heat from the interior to escape more efficiently through regions with lower opacity. We present an analysis {{of the degree to which}} the RCB could be deformed and the resultant change in the evolutionary cooling rate. In this initial work we calculate the upper limit for this effect by comparing an atmospheric structure in local radiative equilibrium to its 1 D equivalent. We find that the cooling through an uneven RCB could be enhanced <b>over</b> <b>cooling</b> through a uniform RCB by as much as 10 - 50 %. We also show that the deformation of the RCB (and the enhancement of the cooling rate) increases with a greater incident stellar flux or a lower inner entropy. Our results indicate that this mechanism could significantly change a planet’s thermal evolution, causing it to cool and shrink more quickly than would otherwise be expected. This may exacerbate the well known difficulty in explaining the very large radii observed for some hot Jupiters...|$|E
