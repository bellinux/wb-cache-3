40|$|We take a {{fresh look}} at the {{connection}} between genericity and (in) definiteness by reconsidering a long-standing puzzle concerning the relation between definiteness and genericity. We contrast English {{on the one hand and}} Romance languages and Hungarian on the other, focusing on generic sentences involving plurals. The two language groups differ in that English uses indefinite bare plurals in generic generalizations (‘Dogs are intelligent’) and in kind-level NPs (‘Dinosaurs are extinct’) while the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> <b>uses</b> definite plurals in both these cases (‘Les chiens sont intelligents’, ‘Les dinosaurs sont éteints’). We argue that this difference is due to the existence of a competition between definite and indefinite forms in generic environments. The contrast results from the fact that the relevant parameters are weighed differently in different languages. The analysis is formulated in terms of O(ptimality) T(heory). It predicts both the overlap and the disparity in article choice for the languages under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the research are : 1) to know whether there is any effect between the using of STAD cooperative learning method and T-P-S toward student achievement from scientific attitude, 2) to know is there any effect scientific attitude between {{the high and low}} category toward student achievement., 3) to examine whether there is any interaction between the influence of STAD cooperative learning and T-P-S with the scientific attitude toward students learning achievement. The research uses experiment method and anava factorial design 2 x 2. The method is used in the research is experiment that including two groups, the first group uses cooperative learning type Think Pair Share (T-P-S) and the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> <b>uses</b> cooperative learning type Student Team Achievement Divisions (STAD). Both is assumed same all relevant aspect but the difference way of teaching. The technique is used to gather the scientific attitude data of student and affective aspect uses closed questionaire which the students’ cognitive aspect data are checked by multiple-choice test.

40|$|Ample {{research}} has been conducted investigating the built environment impacts on pedestrian movement (PM). A clear division is also evident in the literature on this topic: one group tends to use geographic measures (metric distance) of the environment to explain pedestrian behaviour; the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> <b>uses</b> syntactic measures (visual distance). Many review articles have been published on the former. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} effect size (ES), directions, and consistency of syntactic measures in explaining PM. This paper fills this gap through a meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies on this topic spanning over 1975 – 2016, and answers the following five research questions: (a) What are the different measures used in the space syntax literature to explain PM?; (b) What are the magnitudes and directions of associations between space syntax measures and PM?; (c) Which space syntax measure has a more consistent relationship with PM?; (d) To what extent do the explanatory powers of different measures vary between their derivation methods?; and (e) What are the likely causes of variations of the reported results in prior studies? This research examined four syntactic measures (integration, connectivity, choice, and control) in a random effect model with 95 % confidence interval (CI). The choice and integration measures were further investigated based on their operational approaches (topological, angular and metric). Results show that integration (ES[*]=[*] 0. 206, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 173 – 0. 238, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), choice (ES[*]=[*] 0. 481, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 391 – 0. 561, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and connectivity (ES[*]=[*] 0. 305, 95 % CI[*]=[*]− 0. 225 – 0. 696, p[*]=[*] 0. 257) measures positively influence PM with choice being the strongest predictor. Both connectivity and control (ES[*]=[*]− 0. 001, 95 % CI[*]=[*]− 0. 117 – 0. 115, p[*]=[*] 0. 990) were found to have a statistically insignificant impact. The choice and integration measures show stronger effects when derived using the angular approach (ES[*]=[*] 0. 493 for choice, and ES[*]=[*] 0. 502 for integration) compared to topological approach (ES[*]=[*] 0. 374 for choice, and ES[*]=[*] 0. 124 for integration). However, the reported results of all measures are highly heterogeneous, perhaps due to the differences in research design. The significance, magnitude, and consistency of integration and choice measures justify their relevance in built environment interventions to promote PM...|$|E
