25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & <b>Operation</b> <b>risk</b> groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

Now the operators use real-time data and their experience to dispatch the system, but the huge data system brings much inconvenience to operators.

Fault tree is used to simulate dispatching operation process and comprehensively analyze the system risk in both under-successful and failure state of the <b>operation.</b> <b>Risk</b> indices are given to quantitatively reflect the risk level of each operation step based on local information, such as voltage out-of-limit risk, line overload risk, load curtailment risk, so that the operators can clearly recognize the risk and risk sources in each operation step and take corresponding pre-control measures.

In order to solve the defects of the present preventive maintenance strategies, according to the engineering application and based on risk-cost analysis, a short-term maintenance strategy is proposed in this manuscript.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{operation}} safety of expressway tunnels on operation {{efficiency of the}} expressway network is significant because tunnels are key sections in the network. In case of emergency, e. g. traffic accidents, it brings much difficulty to rescue work and may paralyze traffic in the tunnel and even that of the entire expressway. In order to guarantee the tunnel operation safety, {{it is necessary to}} monitor the operation of tunnels and take effective measures to keep safety under control. This paper focuses on <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> modeling of expressway tunnels and development of a monitoring-warning system for real time expressway tunnel operation control. The research includes an investigation of expressway tunnel <b>operation,</b> <b>risk</b> analysis, development of risk modeling and intelligent monitoring-warning system and a pilot project. Over thirty cases of expressway tunnel operation were investigated and filed data of the operation situations including traffic accidents, running speed, acceleration and deceleration of vehicles were collected. Then, the operation conditions and risks were analyzed and the <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> model was then developed to solve the problem. Based on the investigation data of the tunnel operation, five types of emergency incidents were identified and classified with regard to the effect of incidents on the tunnel operation risks and efficiency. The emergency incidents were defined respectively as traffic incidents, severe weather, overspeeding, dangerous goods transportation and scheduled event. These incidents were graded in relation to the levels of effect on tunnel operation safety. Comprehensive traffic control measures for each incident were put forward respectively in order to achieve effective tunnel traffic management, which included speed limit, safe driving distance, closed lanes and traffic guides. To implement real time control and effective tunnel operation management, an intelligent tunnel monitoring-warning system including the system software and relative equipment were developed with functions of information collection, information processing and transmission and information release. A pilot project has been implemented at Huotanwan tunnel (left line) on the Baomao expressway (G 65) in Hunan province, China...|$|E

Therefore, scientific assessment of power distribution equipment <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> is significant {{to the security of}} power distribution system. In order to get the satisfactory assessment conclusions from the complete and incomplete information and improve the assessment level, an operational risk assessment model of distribution network equipment based on rough set and D-S evidence theory was built.

40|$|The {{new concept}} for {{operation}} of drones, published by EASA in 2015 enables {{new ways to}} influence and possibly reduce the necessary safety targets of certain software components without reducing the overall safety of the unmanned aircraft system (UAS). Based on a safety assessment, the so called specific category enables new aircraft system architectures and mission designs. In this context, this paper proposes runtime monitoring as a mitigation strategy for the operation {{getting out of control}} to formally assure predefined properties in flight and thus assure the safety of the operation in progress. One particular aspect of this safe operation monitoring is geofencing, the capability to assure containment of the UAS in a previously restricted area. In the regulatory framework of a specific <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> assessment, such a geofence can be interpreted as a harm barrier. The functional requirements for this geofencing use case are discussed regarding their impact on the underlying specific <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> assessment. To achieve this, we develop a taxonomy of geofencing characteristics. Consequently, the geofencing requirements are assessed regarding their robustness and applicability for certification purposes. As a result, by monitoring the integrity of the system at runtime, exemplified in this paper with the use case of geofencing, it is investigated if the requirements and thus costs of development and certification process for the remaining components can be reduced...|$|E
