2500|$|In Chapter One of Evangelii Gaudium (EG) on “The Church’s Missionary Transformation”, Pope Francis {{speaks of}} {{his dream of}} [...] "a missionary impulse capable of {{transforming}} everything, so that the Church’s customs ... and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today’s world rather than for her self-preservation" [...] (EG 27). For Francis, [...] "missionary outreach is paradigmatic for all the Church’s activity” (EG15) and it is “the entire People of God which evangelizes” (EG 17), called by their baptism to be missionary disciples (EG 120). They should be troubled in conscience that so many, <b>our</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters, live without the sense of purpose and consolation that come from knowing Jesus Christ and without a faith community for support (EG 49). Francis was schooled in theSpiritual Exercisesof the Jesuit founderIgnatius of Loyola which immerse one {{in the life of}} Jesus to gain “an intimate knowledge of our Lord, … that I may love Him more and follow Him more closely.” [...] He reveals the focus of his own life by mentioning the personal name ”Jesus” 125 times in Evangelii Gaudium..|$|E
2500|$|The anti-war {{sentiment}} by Asian Americans {{was fueled}} by the racial inequality that they faced in the United States. As historian Daryl Maeda notes, [...] "the antiwar movement articulated Asian Americans’ racial commonality with Vietnamese people in two distinctly gendered ways: identification based on the experiences of male soldiers and identification by women." [...] Asian American soldiers in the U.S. military were many times classified as being like the enemy. They were referred to as gooks and had a racialized identity in comparison to their non-Asian counterparts. There was also the hypersexualization of Vietnamese women which in turn affected how Asian American {{women in the military}} were treated. [...] "In a Gidra article, , Evelyn Yoshimura noted that the U.S. military systematically portrayed Vietnamese women as prostitutes as a way of dehumanizing them." [...] Asian American groups realized in order to extinguish racism, they also had to address sexism as well. This in turn led to women’s leadership in the Asian American antiwar movement. Patsy Chan, a “Third World” activist, said at an antiwar rally in San Francisco, “We, as Third World women [...] our militant solidarity with <b>our</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters from Indochina. We, as Third World people know of the struggle the Indochinese are waging against imperialism, because we share that common enemy in the United States.” [...] Some other notable figures were Grace Lee Boggs and Yuri Kochiyama. Both Boggs and Kochiyama were inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s and “a growing number of Asian Americans began to push forward a new era in radical Asian American politics.” ...|$|E

60|$|But the {{doctrine}} of the loving Fatherhood of God, as revealed to us in Christ, is one that is unfolding itself more and more clearly to the Christian world.

All human excellences whatsoever exist in their fulness and perfection in Him.

60|$|There is his plan. It is a {{very simple}} one. It goes on the same {{principle}} as 'He that saveth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life shall save it.' If we are selfish, and take care only of ourselves, the day will come when our neighbours will leave us alone in our selfishness to shift for ourselves. If we set out determining through life to care about other people rather than ourselves, then they will care for themselves more than for us, and measure their love to us by our measure of love to them. But if we care for others, they will learn to care for us; if we befriend others, they will befriend us. If we show forth the Spirit of God to them, in kindliness, generosity, patience, self-sacrifice, the day will surely come when we shall find that the Spirit of God is in our neighbours {{as well as in}} ourselves; that on the whole they will be just to us, and pay us what we have deserved and earned. Blessed and comfortable thought, that no kind word, kind action, not even the cup of cold water given in Christ's name, can lose its reward. Blessed thought, that after all our neighbours are <b>our</b> <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> that if we remember that steadily, and treat them as brothers now, they will recollect it too some day, and treat us as brothers in return. Blessed thought, that there is in the heart of every man a spark of God's light, a grain of God's justice, which may grow up in him hereafter, and bear good fruit to eternal life.|$|E
60|$|Now {{there is}} no such impulse to suffer our sisters and brothers, our aunts and uncles, much less our cousins. If we could choose our relatives, we might, by {{selecting}} congenial ones, mitigate the repulsive effect of the obligation to like them and to admit them to our intimacy. But to have a person imposed on us as a brother merely because he happens to have the same parents is unbearable when, as may easily happen, he is the sort of person we should carefully avoid if he were anyone else's brother. All Europe (except Scotland, which has clans instead of families) draws the line at second cousins. Protestantism draws it still closer by making the first cousin a marriageable stranger; and the only reason for not drawing it at sisters and brothers is that the institution of the family compels us to spend our childhood with them, and thus imposes on us a curious relation in which familiarity destroys romantic charm, and is yet expected to create a specially warm affection. Such a relation is dangerously factitious and unnatural; and the practical moral is that the less said at home about specific family affection the better. Children, like grown-up people, get on well enough together if they are not pushed down one another's throats; and grown-up relatives will get on together in proportion to their separation and their care not to presume on their blood relationship. We should let children's feelings take their natural course without prompting. I have seen a child scolded and called unfeeling because it did not occur to it to make a theatrical demonstration of affectionate delight when its mother returned after an absence: a typical example {{of the way in which}} spurious family sentiment is stoked up. We are, after all, sociable animals; and if we are let alone in the matter of our affections, and well brought up otherwise, we shall not get on any the worse with particular people because they happen to be <b>our</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters and cousins. The danger lies in assuming that we shall get on any better.|$|E
