30|$|<b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present {{meta-analysis}} show {{no difference}} in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> PA between children living in single-parent families and those living in two-parent families.

Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> published <b>studies</b> had a low response rate, and <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> were based on small samples. As <b>the</b> reported percentages <b>of</b> children exposed to SPFS were below what is officially reported for Europe [10] and USA [11], it may suggest that respondents from single-parent families tended to participate in <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> to a lower extent than what could be expected from random sampling variability. However, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> included <b>studies</b> addressed this issue. Thus, <b>the</b> low percentage <b>of</b> children from single-parent families suggests that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> {{may be influenced by}} selection bias.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> {{included}} <b>studies</b> had {{a number}} of limitations which have led to biased outcomes.

Moreover, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> mentioned if any animals were lost during the experiments. Furthermore, more than half <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> did not include appropriate numbers of animals in experimental and control groups [15, 17, 20, 22].
