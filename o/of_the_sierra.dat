5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{circular}} in outcrop, the Alpa Corral plutón is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-tectonic monzogranitic plutons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Pampeanas, in Córdoba (Argentina). This pluton intrudes the Early Paleozoic basement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Pampeanas during Late Devonian times. This concentrically zoned pluton {{is made up}} by inequigranular to porphyritic monzogranites, {{distributed in}} two units: a internal unit formed by coarse to porphyritic granite and a external unit represented by inequigranular leucogranite. Bulk magnetic susceptibility (K) shows bimodal distribution, reflecting magnetite-rich granites for the internal unit and magnetite-poor to paramagnetic granites within external unit. Microstructural evidence indicates that magnetic fabrics are entirely magmatic in origin and reflect the internal magma dynamics. From structural and Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility measurements, <b>the</b> internal structure <b>of</b> this pluton has been inferred. According to the AMS and structural data from the country rocks, <b>the</b> emplacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alpa Corral pluton took place after <b>the</b> vanishement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compresional stress field responsible for the main structures recorded in the country rocks. However, some control by a far field stress can be deduced from <b>the</b> NNW-SSE alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-tectonic plutons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Pampeanas. This suggests that granite emplacement was controlled {{by a set of}} early master fractures related to the extensional collapse in this sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Pampeana...|$|R

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada mountain range.

In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada.|$|E

5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre.

In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E

5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor.

Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
