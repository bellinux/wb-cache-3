5|$|An {{abnormal}} formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> socket, {{known as}} hip dysplasia, affected nearly 64% of Pugs {{in a survey}} performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested.|$|E
30|$|At {{skeletal}} maturity, 55  % (11 / 20) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> {{were considered}} as normal or near normal hips, 30  % (6 / 20) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> were dysplastic and 10  % (2 / 20) were either subluxated or dislocated.

However, they reported that 68  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> needed further surgery in their study while no hips required revision surgery in the present series.|$|R

5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5|$|American rapper Nelly has {{released}} seven studio albums, two compilation albums, one remix album, two extended plays, two mixtapes, 47 singles (including fourteen as a featured performer), three promotional singles and 48 music videos.

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint {{which can}} cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E

5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests just in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint.|$|E
5|$|Lecrae Devaughn Moore (born October 9, 1979), mononymously {{known as}} Lecrae, is an American Christian hip hop {{recording}} artist, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He is the president, co-owner {{and co-founder of}} the independent record label Reach Records, and the co-founder {{and president of the}} now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries. To date, he has released seven studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, and one EP as the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to his label as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records in a joint deal between his label and Columbia.|$|E

The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
