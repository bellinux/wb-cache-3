25|$|Released a {{few weeks}} before the start of the Great Depression, Welcome Danger was a huge {{financial}} success, with audiences eager to hear Lloyd's voice on film.

25|$|While the {{specific}} {{plant and equipment}} utilized by Lawrence & Foulks is not known, wooden shipbuilding firms in this era could be established for a remarkably small outlayas little as $11,000, and rarely more than $20,000. Tradesmen at this time mostly supplied their own tools, so a shipyard needed {{little more than a}} waterfront property large enough to hold a timber yard and a slipway <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>a</b> derrick to lift heavy components, a large crosscut saw and a few other tools.|$|E

25|$|Thin, rocky soil {{prevented}} {{the establishment of}} large farms in the Trapps. Families grew a few acres of corn, buckwheat, rye, oats, or potatoes; they kept a horse, cow <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>a</b> handful of chickens, perhaps a few pigs. They supplemented their subsistence farm crops by selling butter, fruit, and eggs. Trapps men also shaved barrel hoops; peeled hemlock and oak bark for nearby leather tanneries; carved millstones from conglomerate rock; and burned charcoal. The Van Leuvens were a Trapps family widely known for burning Shawangunk charcoal.|$|E
25|$|Data {{indicate}} that the diagnosis of BPD is more variable over time than the DSM implies. Substantial percentages (for example around a third, depending on criteria) of people diagnosed with BPD achieve remission within a year <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>A</b> longitudinal study found that, six years after being diagnosed with BPD, 56 percent showed good psychosocial functioning, compared to 26 percent at baseline. Although vocational achievement was more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders, those whose symptoms had remitted {{were significantly more likely}} to have a good relationship with a spouse/partner and at least one parent, good work/school performance, a sustained work/school history, good global functioning and good psychosocial functioning.|$|E

2500|$|Because the manga {{was often}} {{published}} during the anime's production, the anime would only lag the manga by <b>a</b> month <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>As</b> a result, [...] "the anime follows the storyline of the manga fairly closely." [...] Takeuchi {{has stated that}} due to Toei's largely male production staff, she feels that the anime version has [...] "a slight male perspective." ...|$|R

500|$|Peter and I usually write very quickly. It's {{usually a}} day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>a</b> song, {{but for some}} reason this didn't really hit us as a hit song. We didn't give up on it. We just kept working on it {{over the course of a}} year. Thank God we did. [...] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album. It made me nervous as a writer, because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn't make it in the long run. But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me.|$|E
2500|$|As {{quickly as}} July 1924, the Sealed Set system was {{declared}} to be unsuccessful {{and it was}} replaced by a system of A Class and B Class stations. [...] There were one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>A</b> Class stations in each major market and these were paid for by a listener's licence fee imposed on all listeners-in. The five former Sealed Set stations became A Class stations, and they were soon joined by the following stations in other State capitals: ...|$|E
2500|$|The four tallest {{buildings}} {{in the area are}} located in downtown Minneapolis. The first skyscraper built west of the Mississippi in 1929 was the Foshay Tower. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallestâ€”most Minnesotans would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in early 2005, {{it was found that the}} IDS Center is taller by a [...] washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by a foot <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>a</b> rather negligible amount.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Han unification {{is based on the}} distinction between glyphs, as defined in Unicode, and the related but distinct idea of graphemes. Unicode assigns abstract characters (graphemes), as opposed to glyphs, which are a particular visual representations of a character in a specific typeface. One character may be represented by many distinct glyphs, for example a [...] "g" [...] or an [...] "a", both of which may have one loop (a, g) <b>or</b> <b>two</b> (<b>a,</b> g). Yet for a reader of Latin script based languages the two variations of the [...] "a" [...] character are both recognized as the same grapheme. Graphemes present in national character code standards have been added to Unicode, as required by Unicode's Source Separation rule, even where they can be composed of characters already available. The national character code standards existing in CJK languages are considerably more involved, given the technological limitations under which they evolved, and so the official CJK participants in Han unification may well have been amenable to reform.|$|E
