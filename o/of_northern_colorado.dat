50|$|The Greenback {{cutthroat}} trout was original thought extinct in 1937.

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work. Robert Thompson, a professor of media studies at Syracuse University, stated that [...] "It's one thing for guys to like motorcycles and muscle cars and soccer. For a guy to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it. Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Colorado</b> in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E
500|$|Khan's {{pursuit of}} Kirk {{is central to}} the film's theme of vengeance, and The Wrath of Khan {{deliberately}} borrows heavily from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. To make the parallels clear to viewers, Meyer added a visible copy of Moby-Dick to Khan's dwelling. Khan liberally paraphrases Ahab, with [...] "I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up!". Khan also quotes Ahab's tirade {{at the end of the}} novel verbatim with his final lines: [...] "to the last I grapple with thee; from Hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." [...] Kirk represents both the restless elements of Ishmael as well as the titular white whale of Melville's novel; Khan's blind pursuit of Kirk mirrors Captain Ahab's obsession with Moby-Dick. Both Khan and Ahab pursue their quarry against the better judgment of their crew, and end up killing themselves in an effort to take their foe with them. University <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Colorado</b> professor Jane Wall Hinds argues that the themes of The Wrath of Khan clash with the optimistic and transcendentalist perspectives of the original series and [...] Moby Dicks themes of vengeance would later heavily influence [...]|$|E
