5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} a depiction of the city wall, and two silver strips representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and a bear, stand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> acorns, a link to Bladud, {{the subject of the}} Legend of Bath. The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line {{the bed of}} the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
40|$|During a {{study of}} dietary effects on {{reproductive}} efficiency in female rats, high mortality among the sucking pups was observed in both control and experi-mental groups. This mortality was attributed to keeping the pups <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> highly aromatic cedar-wood shavings. The experiment described demonstrates this effect and warns of the hazards in raising rat pups <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> cedar-wood shavings. Pick & Little (1965) have shown that keeping rats <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> cedar-wood shavings affected the thresholds of response to pentylenetetrazol, but no studies of the effects <b>of</b> such <b>bedding</b> on pup growth and mortality have been reported. The present experiment also describes the suitability <b>of</b> rat <b>bedding</b> materials consisting <b>of</b> ground corncobs and shredded aspen shavings.

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> broken glass.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that year}} John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although the boat is sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, {{each of which is}} generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Burley {{tobacco is}} an air-cured tobacco used {{primarily}} for cigarette production. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> fertilized water in March or April.|$|E

25|$|The ‘‘hiding’’ effect {{takes into}} account the fact that, while small grains are {{inherently}} more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.|$|E

25|$|Fresh fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} food product, {{so it must be}} eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time.

25|$|It is {{said that}} the Francesinha was invented in the 1960s. Daniel da Silva, a {{returned}} emigrant from France and Belgium, tried to adapt the croque-monsieur to Portuguese taste. Other versions date the Francesinha to the 19th century. It is a very popular dish in Porto and {{is associated with the}} city, although it can be sometimes found elsewhere in Portugal. A classic francesinha meal would include the sandwich, surrounded <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> chips doused in the famous , and complemented with a fino, literally meaning thin or fine, which in this context refers to draught beer.|$|E
50|$|Another {{class of}} cars is Ice Racing, used for racing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slick <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> ice. Acceleration {{is the same}} as a {{conventional}} rally car but a lower gear ratio and only 4 speeds gives these cars a top speed of about 125 mph (about 200 km/h).

25|$|The Torsa river flows by {{the western}} side of town. Heavy rains often cause strong river {{currents}} and flooding. The turbulent water carries huge amounts of sand, silt, and pebbles, which have an adverse effect on crop production {{as well as on the}} hydrology of the region. Alluvial deposits form the soil, which is acidic. Soil depth varies from 15cm to 50cm, superimposed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> sand. The foundation materials are igneous and metamorphic rocks at a depth 1000m to 1500m. The soil has low levels of nitrogen with moderate levels of potassium and phosphorus. Deficiencies of boron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and sulphur are high.|$|E
25|$|The Viae glareatae were earthed roads with a graveled {{surface or}} a gravel {{subsurface}} and paving on top. Livy {{speaks of the}} censors of his time as being the first to contract for paving the streets of Rome with flint stones, for laying gravel on the roads outside the city, and for forming raised footpaths at the sides. In these roads, the surface was hardened with gravel, and although pavements were introduced shortly afterwards, the blocks were allowed to rest merely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> small stones. An example of this type is found on the Praenestine Way. Another example is found near the Via Latina.|$|E
