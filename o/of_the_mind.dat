5|$|Chapter 7 {{discusses}} the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which {{it says is}} of five forms. This stage is one where the focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness. The theory of Marma (joints) is presented, and 18 vital points inside one's body are listed {{that can be used}} as focal points to help initial stages of the meditative exercises.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> John’s Multiple Personality Disorder {{in the movie}} Peacock.

To analyze <b>the</b> battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds,</b> I am using <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Multiple Personality Disorder.

5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also led him to the formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phenomenal externalism {{suggests}} that the phenomenal aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> are external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.|$|E
5|$|Semantic externalism {{holds that}} the {{semantic}} content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is totally or partially defined by state of affairs external {{to the body of}} the subject. Hilary Putnam's Twin earth thought experiment is a good example.|$|E

5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief in the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E
5|$|The mind–body problem {{concerns}} {{the explanation of}} the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. The main aim of philosophers working {{in this area is}} to determine the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.|$|E

5|$|Aside from Rock Steady Crew, several {{breaking}} {{crews were}} active in the 1970s such as Mighty Zulu Kings, Dynamic Rockers, New York City Breakers, SalSoul, Air Force Crew, Crazy Commanders Crew, Starchild La Rock, and Rockwell Association. In the same way b-boy crews were active {{on the east coast}} of the United States spreading breaking throughout New York, funk crews were also active on the west coast spreading the funk styles throughout California. Aside from The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos, other funk styles crews such as Medea Sirkas/Demons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind,</b> Black Messengers, The Robot Brothers, The Go-Go Brothers, Granny and Robotroid, and Chain Reaction were active during the 1970s performing on stage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E

5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|Functionalism was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor {{as a reaction}} to the inadequacies of the identity theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b> At about the same time or slightly after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E

5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental consciousness, or the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Reception of {{the book}} has {{generally}} been positive. It has also become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps.

In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
