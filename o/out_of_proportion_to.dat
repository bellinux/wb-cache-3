5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the meagre money. Many {{of the most prominent}} figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent of the}} ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E

25|$|Because of the three-fifths {{compromise}} in the U.S. Constitution, in which slaves {{counted in the}} calculation of how many representatives a state had in Congress (though only three-fifths {{as much as a}} free person), the planter class had long held power in Congress <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the total number of free people in the US population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, kibbutzniks {{played a}} role in yishuv society and then Israeli society, far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> their population, and many kibbutzniks have served Israel in {{positions}} of leadership. The invention of the Tower and Stockade system by which 52 settlements from 1938 to 1947 largely decided the borders of Israel in the UN 29 November 1947 decision, is attributed to kibbutz member Shlomo Gur.|$|E
25|$|Pain is severe, {{frequently}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> physical signs, {{and often}} requires {{the use of}} opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.|$|E

25|$|Former Minister for Transport Martin Cullen also {{announced}} the undertaking of a feasibility study into a rail link for Shannon Airport {{in his speech}} at the launch. This study, undertaken by MVA Consultants, estimated the proposed link would cost €700m, while an Irish Rail manager stated that 'the costs {{of the construction of}} the rail link are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the benefits to be gained'.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS), {{also known}} as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a long term pain syndrome that often worsens with time. It is characterized by severe pain <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the original injury and is often accompanied by sensitivity, swelling, {{and changes in the}} skin. It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of affected people report symptoms throughout their whole body.|$|E
25|$|American {{independence}} led {{to great}} changes for Bermuda. Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural resources, Bermuda was largely ignored {{and left to}} its own devices by the London government. By being so deeply involved in trade, Bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the colony's size {{in relation to the}} development of the Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic English and British empires.|$|E

25|$|The {{music of}} Hawaii {{includes}} traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop. Hawaii's musical {{contributions to the}} music of the United States are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the state's small size. Styles such as slack-key guitar are well-known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar.|$|E
25|$|Geologically {{one of the}} {{youngest}} inhabited territories on Earth, Easter Island, located in the mid-Pacific Ocean, was, for most of its history, one of the most isolated. Its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, have endured famines, epidemics of disease and cannibalism, civil war, slave raids, various colonial contacts, and have seen their population crash on more than one occasion. The ensuing cultural legacy has brought the island notoriety <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the number of its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{was given}} {{authority}} {{to ban the}} international slave trade after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths {{of the number of}} slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Orthodox Christianity? penance, asceticism, self-abnegation--repression--falling on {{my knees}} and seeking a {{forgiveness}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the trespass, and filled with a sense of total depravity? If I did that I should lose myself--the only valuable thing I've got." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wright cursed in amaze. His {{emotions}} were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> his intelligence. He {{was not at}} all quick-witted. I had never seen a vainer or more arrogant man. [...] "Sampson, I don't like your talk," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Now {{here was}} a deal of pother about a {{capuchin}} who had stared at the Madonnino of Anguissola! The matter was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the stir it made, and I conveyed in my next words some notion of that opinion.|$|R
25|$|Several {{companies}} that produced network equipment were irrevocably {{damaged by the}} debt taken on to fund their expansion and went bankrupt, causing {{what is known as}} the telecoms crash. However, some communications {{companies that}} supplied equipment and outsourced manufacturing, such as Cisco and Qualcomm, were able to survive. Similarly, in Europe, mobile phone companies overspent on 3G licences, which led them deep into debt and led to the telecoms crash. The investments in infrastructure were far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> both their current and projected cash flow.|$|E

Styles like slack-key guitar are well-known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar. In addition, the music which began to be played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii in the early 1900s is called cachi cachi music, on the islands of Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|It often {{happened}} {{that the number}} of lay brothers became excessive and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey. On the other hand, at any rate in some countries, the system of lay brothers in course of time worked itself out; thus in England by the close of the 14th century it had shrunk to relatively small proportions, and in the 15th century the régime of the English Cistercian houses tended to approximate more and more to that of the Black Monks.|$|E
60|$|Cahusac was {{disposed}} to be ill-humoured. The risk they had run {{in taking the}} Dutch brig and doing violence {{to members of the}} family of the Governor <b>of</b> Tortuga, was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the value <b>of</b> their prize. He said so, sullenly, to Levasseur.|$|R
60|$|It comforted him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the advantage. At {{least his}} hands were free for any {{emergency}} that might offer.

50|$|The station {{developed}} an importance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the size <b>of</b> the village, {{owing to the}} South Wales coal traffic and the large marshalling yard, {{the largest and most}} important on the GWR. This in turn required engine sheds of proportionate size, housing around 70 engines in 1939.|$|R
25|$|Brixtofte made {{headlines}} {{with a highly}} untraditional sale-and-lease-back model where the municipality sold buildings and facilities to private companies and rented them back. Due to various national tax issues this was highly advantageous for both parties. This scheme allowed the municipality {{to have one of}} the lowest tax rates in Denmark {{at the same time as}} spending a huge amount of money on various welfare programs. Every child in school was given a high-end computer and the elderly were offered a free annual trip to a foreign holiday destination. A lot of prestigious building projects were initiated such as a sports arena and marina completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> what one would expect from a city of this size.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rain {{beginning}} on the 16th kept the 91st {{on the ground}} for the next three days, and on 20 September the 91st was ordered to move to Vavincourt Aerodrome, with new orders to fly observation missions over the Verdun-Argonne sector in preparation for the planned Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The squadron moved by the 22d, and on the 23d operations began from the new station. By early October, with the American infantry advancing on all points between the Argonne and the Meuse, German aircraft were concentrating all available resources to stop the Air Service from getting information about its rear areas. Enemy aircraft were constantly attacking squadron aircraft with a far higher intensity than what was experienced earlier, and the 91st brought down a number of enemy planes, far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> what might be expected from an observation squadron.|$|E
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{granting}} charters {{to police}} unions in June 1919 when pressed {{to do so}} by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities. The Boston police rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.|$|E
5000|$|Their act {{is typical}} of manzai comedy duos, though they are also known for TV {{segments}} filmed in locales such as Hong Kong and Italy. Yabe has tended to receive criticism from Japanese fans because his participation in their skits is small and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> compared <b>to</b> the always active and effervescent Okamura, even as a straightman.|$|R
