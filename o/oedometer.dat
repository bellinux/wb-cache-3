According to Karl von Terzaghi [...] "consolidation is any process which involves a decrease in water content of saturated soil without replacement of water by air." [...] In general it is the process in which reduction in volume takes place by expulsion of water under long term static loads. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing its bulk volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The magnitude of consolidation can be predicted by many different methods.

The aim of the paper is to study the behavior of the Pozzolana and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff subject to freezing and thawing cycle at constant vertical stress under oedometric condition.

In a first stage, swelling tests were carried out on samples initially compressed at constant initial water content (unsaturated) that were afterwards soaked under vertical loads, respectively, smaller and higher than the in-situ vertical stress. All samples exhibited swelling, even at stress higher than the in-situ one. In a second stage, standard step loading compression tests were carried out on samples previously saturated under the in-situ vertical load, so as to investigate the volume change behaviour under load cycles. The strain-stress curves obtained appear to be different to what is currently observed in overconsolidated or cemented clays with no clear appearance of yield and pre-yield reversible behaviour.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} effect of strain rates and time on the compressibility of soft soil. Two clays {{have been used in}} the study: one from Stjørdal and another from Eberg. The main testing equipment has been the CRS <b>oedometer</b> testing equipment. Strain rates varying from 3 %/hr to 0. 3 %/hr have been used in the CRS testing programme. Incrementally loaded oedometers have also been run at 24 -hr intervals and 1 -hr intervals in which pore pressure was measured. The main aim of the incrementally loaded (IL) oedometers at 24 -hr intervals was to obtain creep parameters that were later compared to those from CRS <b>oedometer</b> test. The 1 -hr interval <b>oedometer</b> tests were conducted to investigate the influence of loading time on the compressibility characteristics of soft soil. Also, attempts into automating the IL <b>oedometer</b> scheme have been initiated at loading intervals of 1 -hr using the CRS test equipment. The study has revealed that: • The strain rates of 3 %/hr and 2. 3 %/hr were high for both the Stjørdal and Eberg clay since the pore pressure-load ratio was still higher than 0. 05 while passing the preconsolidation pressures. • Strain rates greatly influence the yield pressures (preconsolidation pressure) of the soft clays. The preconsolidation pressures will increase with increasing strain rate. The modulus numbers in the NC-region are unaffected by strain rate while those in the OC-region showed some variation. The coefficients of consolidation and permeabilities reduce with decreasing strain rate due to creep that develops in the soil skeleton. Therefore excessively slow and fast CRS tests are not desirable; the very fast tests set up high pore pressure gradients in the soil specimens while the very slow ones lead to excessive creep development in the soil skeleton. • Strain rates once carefully selected with controlled pore pressure build-up in the soil specimens, should not have much influence on the compressibility characteristics needed in practical Engineering. However the preconsolidation pressures from CRS <b>oedometer</b> need correction to compare with those from the conventional IL <b>oedometer</b> systems. • Creep resistance numbers obtained from the CRS <b>oedometer</b> were reasonable compared to the Norwegian experience. In some instances, they were in close agreement with those from the conventional 24 -hr step﻿ load tests in IL <b>oedometer.</b> The outstanding challenge is to obtain a suitable strain rate in the CRS <b>oedometer</b> that will give comparable results to those from IL <b>oedometer</b> systems for which majority of the practitioners hold enormous experience. • The longer the loading interval in an IL <b>oedometer,</b> the more creep develops. This has influence on the soil stiffness. Therefore testing time should be considered when designing <b>oedometer</b> testing programmes, in addition to the Engineering problem at hand. • Automation of the IL <b>oedometer</b> test procedure, though only initiated, has shown great potential.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the stress-strain behaviour of two reconstituted granular materials {{in the range of}} very small to large strains and standard to high pressures. Two materials are taken into consideration, namely Boštanj silty sand and carbonate Dogs Bay sand. The important feature of Boštanj silty sand is its high silt content (about 30 % of dry mass), while the main feature of Dogs Bay sand is the fragility of its particles, consequently exhibiting particle crush- ing at low stresses during mechanical loading. The mechanical behaviour of Boštanj silty sand is investigated in the laboratory using the standard triaxial cells, Bishop and Wesley’s triaxial cell, high pressure triaxial cell and <b>oedometers</b> for loading at standard and high pressures. The particle crushing as a consequence of mechanical loading is measured using the apparatus for the dynamic image analyses. The laboratory tests are used to verify the agreement between Boštanj silty sand behaviour and the critical state framework and its supplements for sands, while the effect of ﬁnes leads to deviations from the framework. The laboratory data are also used to supplement the established framework of Dogs Bay sand. Three different interpretation methods of bender element measurement are compared. At the end of thesis the elasto-plastic constitutive model by Taiebat & Dafalias with a minor modiﬁcation is used to simulate the be- haviour of Boštanj silty sand. Model is used for simulations of loading during the triaxial tests and earthquake loading of the material point.

40|$|The {{proposed}} Soil Framework Directive COM(2006) 232 requires Member States {{to identify}} areas {{at risk of}} erosion, decline in organic matter, salinisation, compaction, sealing and landslides, {{as well as to}} set up an inventory of contaminated sites. The present project aims to identify the susceptibility to compaction of soils of the Walloon Region (Belgium) and to recommend good farming practices avoiding soil compaction as far as possible. Within this scope, the concept of precompression stress (Pc) (Horn and Fleige, 2003) was used. Pc is defined as the maximum major principal stress that a soil horizon can withstand against any applied external vertical stress. If applied stress is higher than Pc, the soil enters in a plastic state, not easily reversible. For a given soil, the intensity of soil compaction is mainly due to the applied load which depends on vehicle characteristics (axle load, tyre dimensions, tyre inflation pressure, and vehicle velocity). To determine soil precompression stress, pedotransfert functions of Lebert and Horn (1991) defined at two water suctions (pF 1. 8 and 2. 5) were used. Parameters required by these functions were found within several databases (Aardewerk and Digital Map of Walloon Soils) and literature. The validation of Pc was performed by measuring stress-strain relationships using automatic <b>oedometers.</b> Stresses of 15. 6, 31, 3, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 kPa were applied for 10 min each. In this study, the compaction due to beet harvesters was considered because the axle load can exceed 10 tons and these machines are often used during wet conditions. The compaction at two depth levels was considered: 30 and 50 cm. Compaction of topsoil was not taken into account because, under conventional tillage, the plough depth is lower than 25 cm. Before and after the passage of the machines, following measurements were performed: granulometry, density, soil moisture, pF curve, Atterberg limits, [...] . The software Soilflex (Keller et al., 2007) was used to estimate the distribution of the vertical stresses sigma z in the soil. Comparison was performed between sigma z and Pc. The following data simulated the passage of a beet harvester machine (mass: 23 580 kg; load: 18 000 kg) in a silty soil located in Hesbaye and classified as Aba (Sirjacobs et al., 2000). The passage of the machine would create a Pc of around 100 kPa at 30 cm depth, while the stress induced by the machine would reach 240 kPa. In the field borders, where more vehicle traffic was usually observed and where the soil was over consolidated, Pc would reach 180 kPa, while sigma z would be 220 kPa.

40|$|Due {{to their}} high {{swelling}} ability, high water retention capacity and low permeability, compacted bentonites {{have been considered}} as {{a key component of}} cover lining systems for storage of low and medium level toxic wastes and as barrier and backfilling materials for long-term safe storage of high level toxic waste in many countries. This thesis presents an experimental, theoretical and numerical study of thermo-hydromechanical- chemical behaviour of MX 80 bentonite in geotechnical applications. The determination of swelling pressures of compacted bentonites is an important aspect of most bentonitebased barrier systems. Swelling pressures of bentonites are usually determined in the laboratory under constant volume conditions using <b>oedometers.</b> Powdered bentonites are usually compacted in stainless steel cylindrical specimen rings and tested immediately after the compaction process is completed. The swelling pressures thus measured are influenced by some post compaction residual stresses. However, bentonites in the form of pellets and bricks are prepared and used in repository conditions that, in turn, are free from any post compaction residual stresses. The influence of post compaction residual stress on swelling pressures of compacted bentonites for a range of dry density that are of interest has not been explored in the past. Such studies are of potential interest for the safe and efficient designs of toxic waste disposal repositories. Many of the waste repositories are commissioned in locations where the ground water either contains significant amount of salts or the repositories are anticipated to receive saline water from sea. Additionally, in some cases, the wastes that are disposed emit very high temperatures (e. g. spent fuel). Under these repository conditions, compacted bentonite barriers are subjected to both thermal and hydraulic loadings at opposite boundaries. A detailed study devoted to appreciate the combined influence of an elevated temperature, bulk fluid type and solute transport due to both hydraulic and thermal gradients are necessary to better the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of compacted bentonites in many practical engineering problems. Constant volume swelling pressure tests were carried out on compacted MX 80 bentonite specimens in order to study the influence of post compaction residual stress, electrolyte concentration and temperature (for isothermal conditions) on the swelling pressure. The dry density of the bentonite was varied between 1. 1 to 1. 9 Mg/m 3 to cover a wide range of compaction conditions. Theoretical assessments of swelling pressures were made using the Gouy-Chapman diffuse double layer theory and the Stern theory, as applicable to interacting clay platelet systems. Further, the experimental and the theoretical swelling pressures were compared in order to bring out the applicability of the electrical theories in assessing swelling pressures of bentonites for both compacted saturated and initially saturated slurried conditions. A series of thermal and thermo-hydraulic tests were carried out on bentonite specimens under laboratory scale settings. During the thermal tests, temperatures of 85 and 25 °C were applied at the bottom and top ends of the specimens, respectively. During the thermo-hydraulic tests, in addition to unequal temperature at opposite ends, distilled water was supplied from the top end of the specimens. The temperature and the relative humidity were monitored along predetermined depths of the specimens during both types of testing methods. The swelling pressure variations were monitored {{at the opposite end of}} the heat source. Changes in water content, dry density and concentrations of cations and anions along predetermined depths of the specimens were measured after termination of each of the tests. A thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element simulation was undertaken specifically for swelling pressures using the numerical code COMPASS (COde for Modelling PArtially Saturated Soils). Further, the experimental and the simulated results were compared both for thermal and thermo-hydraulic boundary conditions. Compacted bentonite specimens with post compaction residual stresses exhibited lesser swelling pressures as compared to their stress released counterparts. Agreements between the calculated swelling pressures from the Stern theory and the experimental swelling pressure results were found to be reasonable for compaction dry densities of less than 1. 45 Mg/m 3, whereas at higher dry densities, agreements between the measured swelling pressures and those calculated from the electrical theories were found to be poor. Conversely, compressibility behaviour of initially saturated slurried bentonites was found to be captured well by the electrical theories. On account of vapour flow under thermal gradients, compacted bentonite specimens exhibited swelling pressures at the opposite end of the heat source. The measured swelling pressure for the thermal gradient adopted varied between 0. 5 to 1. 2 MPa, whereas greater swelling pressures were noted due to an applied thermo-hydraulic gradient. Evaporation, condensation, diffusion and advection processes influenced the distribution of ions in compacted bentonite when subjected to both thermal and thermo-hydraulic gradients. The finite element code, COMPASS, enabled assessing changes in suction and swelling pressure of compacted bentonite satisfactorily under both thermal and thermo-hydraulic hydraulic gradients.

In contrast, little attempt has been made to formulate a theoretical framework to simulate these testing procedures and to visualize the different stress paths used in the various methods. The primary objective of this research program is to formulate a theoretical framework which can embrace all swelling testing procedures. The formulations are to accommodate various boundary conditions and to simulate the stress paths that have been followed using various testing procedures. The research program commenced with a literature review which provided a summary of the research which have been conducted on laboratory swelling pressure measurement and the theoretical simulation of swell testing methods. A theoretical model for describing the pore-water pressure and volume change behavior during various swelling <b>oedometer</b> tests is formulated. The theory is based on the equilibrium equation, the constitutive equations for unsaturated soils and the continuity equation for the pore fluids. A computer program, SWELL, based on the theoretical model is developed using finite element method. The presented theory is used to describe the behavior observed during the experimental program. Several types of laboratory tests (i. e., falling head permeability test, Free Swell <b>oedometer</b> test, pressure plate test, shrinkage test and constant suction consolidation test) were performed to identify the appropriate soil properties and variables which control the swelling behavior of an unsaturated soil during the swelling <b>oedometer</b> tests. Several empirical equations were proposed to describe the soil properties. The proposed theory was used to simulate the results from the Free Swell <b>oedometer</b> tests, the Constant Volume <b>oedometer</b> tests, constant water content (i. e., undrainage loading) <b>oedometer</b> test and the Loaded Swell <b>oedometer</b> tests. In general, good agreement was found among the computed and measure values of volume change, vertical total stress and pore-water pressure. Additional analyses were conducted using various values for the saturated coefficient of permeability and the imposed boundary conditions. The computed rate of swelling were found to be quite sensitive to the coefficient of permeability of the soil and the length of the drainage path. The final stress state and surface evaporation were also found to influence the rate of swelling, the percent swell, and the swelling pressure...|$|E

40|$|When {{expansive}} clay is wetted, deformations occur both vertically and laterally. If it {{is tested}} in an <b>oedometer</b> ring apparatus the lateral deformation will be restrained {{by the wall}} of the ring. This paper present the results of an experimental investigation using modified <b>oedometer</b> test for measuring the vertical and lateral swelling potential and lateral pressure of disturbed expansive clay soil. Series of modified <b>oedometer</b> tests were conducted with initial water content of 20 %, 25 % and 30 %, to predict the vertical and lateral swelling potential and lateral swell pressure. The results of the test show that the percentages of the vertical swell is bigger than the lateral swell. Both vertical and lateral swell, linearly decrease with increasing initial water content. The lateral swell pressure also decreases with increasing initial water content...|$|E

40|$|Department of Civil Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation in which the feasibility of using a stress path triaxial cell for evaluating the vertical swell of expansive soils under multi-dimensional loading conditions was examined. Series of triaxial swell tests were conducted, and the influence of confinement and initial water content on the predicted vertical swell was evaluated. The results of these tests were compared with the volume changes observed for samples tested under identical initial conditions in the <b>oedometer.</b> The vertical swell linearly decreased with increasing confining pressure and initial water content. The percentages of ultimate vertical swell obtained from triaxial swell tests were considerably lower than the corresponding values measured in the <b>oedometer</b> tests. Besides, the rate of decrease in the vertical swell with increasing applied pressure is higher for the <b>oedometer</b> tests...|$|E
