40|$|Background: Medical {{treatment}} of the rare interstitial ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate has been considered an alternative to surgical resection. Aim: To determine the treatment success rate with a single-dose intravenous methotrexate/folinic acid regimen and to identify predictors of treatment outcome. Methods: A 5 -year audit (April 2000 -August 2005) was carried out, collecting clinical imaging data and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG). Time taken for complete beta-hCG resolution was recorded, and a negative beta-hCG result {{was used as an}} endpoint of successful outcome. Results: Of the 13 cases, two required urgent surgery for rupture on presentation. In the remaining 11 cases, intravenous methotrexate (300 mg) was used, with oral folinic acid rescue (15 mg x 4 doses). There were no side-effects. Complete beta-hCG resolution was achieved in 10 of the 11 medically treated cases (91 % success rate), requiring 21 - 129 days. Successful outcome was seen with initial beta-hCG level as high as 106 634 IU/L and gestation sac as large as 6 cm and a live fetus. Conclusion: The methotrexate/folinic acid regimen used as a <b>one-dose</b> <b>treatment</b> is safe and effective for unruptured interstitial pregnancy, with no side-effects and the advantage of avoiding invasive surgery. Subsequent tubal patency and reproductive function are yet to be ascertained...|$|E
40|$|Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPDH) {{from human}} pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aerugi-nosa {{can be readily}} inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS) -mediated direct oxidation of their catalytic active cysteines. Be-cause of the rapid degradation of H 2 O 2 by bacterial catalase, only steady-state but not <b>one-dose</b> <b>treatment</b> with H 2 O 2 rapidly in-duces glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). We conducted transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses to globally profile the bacterial transcriptomes {{in response to a}} steady level of H 2 O 2, which revealed profound transcriptional changes, including the induced expression of glycolytic genes in both bacteria. Our results revealed that the inactivation of GAPDH by H 2 O 2 induces metabolic levels of glycolysis and the PPP; the elevated levels of fructose 1, 6 -biphosphate (FBP) and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy- 6 -phosphogluconate (KDPG) lead to dissociation of their corresponding glycolytic repressors (GapR and HexR, respectively) from their cognate promoters, thus resulting in derepression of the glycolytic genes to overcome H 2 O 2 -stalled gly-colysis in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Both GapR and HexR may directly sense oxidative stresses, such as menadione. Pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa andStaphylococcus aureus, need to conquer high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced by host phago-cytic cells for sustained virulence (1). To this end, these bacteria use ROS-reactive small molecules, such as glutathione (GSH) an...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedMucositis of the {{alimentary}} tract (AT) or alimentary mucositis is a debilitating adverse effect of cancer therapies {{in a high}} percentage of patients receiving chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and high-dose radiation to the head and neck. This common oral complication bears a high impact on health, quality of life, a patientâ€™s ability to adhere with the prescribed therapies, as well as the overall economic outcome. Relatively little is known of the pathophysiology of mucositis and current therapeutic interventions are ineffective. Recently a new population of mesenchymal stem cells from human gingiva (hGMSC) have been discovered (Zhang et al., 2009), which exhibit not only multipotent differentiation and self-renewal capacities, but also possess distinct immunomodulatory functions.; We hypothesized that treatment with hGMSC reduces epithelial injuries and ameliorates mucositis of the {{alimentary tract}} (AT) associated with cancer therapies. We explored the feasibility of using hGMSC to reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis induced by cancer therapies. We observed a significant reduction of AT mucositis and recovery of body weight in nearly 100 % of mice undergoing <b>one-dose</b> <b>treatment</b> with hGMSC. Treatment with hGMSC was capable of reducing the incidence and severity of mucosal ulceration, promoting proliferation of mucosal epithelial cells and the regeneration of damaged crypts at the histological level. Our findings suggest that hGMSCs can ameliorate mucositis by promoting the regeneration of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy induced mucosal damage. Thus, hGMSC cell therapy may be a potential agent in the prevention and treatment of AT mucositis...|$|E
