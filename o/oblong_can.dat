5000|$|The first Type C ration {{consisted}} of a one-pound 'meat' unit (M-unit) (reduced to 12 oz after being field tested during the 1940 Louisiana maneuvers). In the initial Type C ration, {{there were only three}} variations of the main course: meat and beans, meat and potato hash, or meat and vegetable stew. Also issued was one bread-and-dessert can, or B-unit. Each daily ration (i.e. enough food for one soldier for one day) {{consisted of}} six 12 oz cans (three M-units and three B-units), while an individual meal consisted of one M-unit and one B-unit. The original <b>oblong</b> <b>can</b> was replaced with the more common cylindrical design in June 1939 due to mass production problems with the former shape of can ...|$|E
5000|$|Bully beef (or {{corned beef}} in the United Kingdom) {{refers to the}} variety made from finely minced corned beef in {{a small amount of}} gelatin (bully beef; from the French bouilli [...] "boiled"), and is sold in distinctive, <b>oblong</b> <b>cans,</b> just as in the United States and Canada, or in slices from supermarkets. It is mainly {{imported}} from Argentina, Brazil, or Uruguay. Bully beef and hardtack biscuits were the main field rations of the British Army from the Boer War to World War II. It is commonly served sliced in a corned beef sandwich. Hash and hotch-potch, in which potatoes and corned beef are stewed together, are also made. Tinned corned beef is also used in mainland Europe. Army bully beef rations were replaced in 2009 by mushroom pasta and halal dishes for troops stationed in Afghanistan.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} San Jose adobes, showing water {{towers and}} fence, ca. 1900. A town {{composed}} of one-story ranch-style shacks is pictured, the houses visible {{to the left side}} of the image where they obscure the bottom scaffolding of two water towers. In the right foreground, the bend of an <b>oblong</b> fence <b>can</b> be seen, possible made of concrete and wrought-iron. The road shown at center is unpaved and furrowed with carriage tracks...|$|R
5000|$|The mata mata's {{brown or}} black, <b>oblong</b> {{carapace}} <b>can</b> {{measure up to}} 45 cm at adult age. The full adult weight is 15 kg. [...] The mata mata's plastron is reduced, narrowed, hingeless, shortened towards the front, and deeply notched at the rear with narrow bridges. These may be meant to allow the turtle to resemble a piece of bark, camouflaging it from possible predators. The plastron and bridges are cream to yellow or brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper part}} of the façade, which has been {{destroyed}} in the 2016 earthquake, was modified according to Renaissance principles. It originally had a rectangular window, but this was replaced by a rose window in the 1930s. A plaque with the old coat of arms of the church and a Latin inscription commemorating the building's architect was found on the right hand side of the façade, below the rose window. A pair of large <b>oblong</b> windows <b>can</b> be found {{on each side of the}} church. A bell tower and the medieval Porta Carbonara stood to the rear of the church.|$|R
5000|$|Celmisia spectabilis {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{widespread}} species in the mountainous areas of New Zealand, where it is commonly known as the cotton daisy. [...] Belonging to the Asteraceae family, the leathery leaves of this species are ovate (egg-shaped) to lanceolate (narrow and tapering to a point) or narrowly <b>oblong,</b> and <b>can</b> reach 30 cm long. They have a shiny, green upper surface, with prominent parallel grooves but their undersides are densely covered in soft, whitish or buff-coloured hairs. The leaf bases overlap and compact to form a stout pseudostem (false stem). Plants can form mats up to 2m across.|$|R
5000|$|Anthoxanthum odaoratum grass {{grows in}} tufts with stems 25 - 40 cm tall, and short, broad green leaves 3 - 5 mm wide, which are {{slightly}} hairy. It flowers from April until June, i.e. quite {{early in the}} season, with flower spikes of 4 - 6 cm long and crowded spikelets of 6 - 10 mm, <b>oblong</b> shaped, which <b>can</b> be quite dark when young. The lower lemmas have projecting awns.|$|R
5000|$|Knotweed {{develops}} a deep tap root (it {{can be as}} deep as 18”), does well in compacted soil, and survives drought conditions. The numerous wiry stems grow out {{from the center of}} the plant giving it a mat-like appearance. The stems are very long and branching and grow in a zigzag form. The leaves are alternate, <b>oblong,</b> hairless, <b>can</b> be ½ to 2 ½ inches long, and are bluish-green in color. The leaf stalk is short and closely surrounded by papery stipules on each node. The stem nodes are slightly swollen and look somewhat like “knots,” thus its common name, knotweed. Flowers, with colors ranging from white to green, are inconspicuous, have no petals, and grow all along the stems. The sepals, however, are pinkish with white edges. Seeds are egg-shaped, dark reddish brown in color, and have a smooth shiny surface.|$|R
50|$|Like other irises, it has 2 {{pairs of}} petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), {{known as the}} 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the '{{standards}}'. The deflexed falls are spathulate (spoon-like) or <b>oblong</b> shaped, and <b>can</b> be veined, brown-purple on yellow-white background, or with claret (dark red). In {{the middle of the}} falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is yellow, golden yellow, or orange.The upright standards are elliptical or oblong shaped, although the tips are inclined to each other. They are also serrated, or jagged.|$|R
50|$|The ripe fruit {{varies in}} size and color. Cultivars are {{variously}} yellow, orange, red, or green, and carry a single flat, <b>oblong</b> pit that <b>can</b> be fibrous or hairy on the surface, and which does not separate easily from the pulp. Ripe, unpeeled mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell. Inside the pit 1 - 2 mm thick is a thin lining covering a single seed, 4 - 7 cm long. The seed contains the plant embryo. Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds; they do not survive freezing and drying.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dough is}} placed {{into the oven}} under a ceiling of steam or, alternatively, the oven is {{injected}} with steam {{as soon as the}} loaf is loaded. This adds moisture to the body of the bread which delays establishment of the crust and tends to prevent cracking, resulting in a more evenly risen and thinner crust as well as a light and airy crumb. [...] When the steam is gone (sometimes today, withdrawn), the dry heat of the oven bakes the crust, producing its characteristically slightly crisp and flaky texture. Vienna bread is typically formed as an <b>oblong</b> loaf, but <b>can</b> be baked in other shapes. As a longer loaf, it may well have been the origin of French bread as bakers there attempted to adopt the steam method to produce their baguettes.|$|R
