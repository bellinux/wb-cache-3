A comprehensive water supply strategy for mining projects is important to ensure that fair allocation of water is maintained for municipal, agricultural and industrial users in the region. The consumption of fresh water for processing copper concentrates can be substantially reduced through the adoption of hydrometallurgical processes that incorporate salt water; particularly when compared to pyrometallurgical processes that require fresh water. Developed by Teck, the CESL hydrometallurgical process allows for the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> reduce fresh <b>water</b> requirements in the processing of copper concentrates. Further, it should be noted that <b>water</b> additions <b>to</b> the process are already minimized through reclaiming process water by use of a closed-circuit evaporator. Bench-scale testwork is presented which demonstrates the opportunities related <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> additions on metal recovery and overall metallurgical performance. An average copper extraction of 97. 3 % was achieved while fresh water consumption was decreased from 1. 63 m 3 /t concentrate to 0. 67 m 3 /t concentrate through <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> substitution.

Development took place in 5 ml syringes, connected by tubing to activation syringes, containing <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> and termination syringes, containing fixative. Comparison of space results with simultaneous ground control experiments showed that equivalent percentages of naupliar larvae hatched in the syringes (40 %). Thus, reactivation of development, completion of embryogenesis, emergence and hatching took place, during spaceflight, without recognizable alteration in numbers of larvae produced. Post-hatching larval development was studied in experiments where development was terminated, by introduction of fixative, 2 days, 4 days, and 8 days after reinitiation of development. During spaceflight, successive larval instars or stages, interrupted by molts, occurred, generating brine shrimp at appropriate larval instars. Naupliar larvae possessed the single naupliar eye, and development of the lateral pair of adult eyes also took place in space. Transmission electron microscopy revealed extensive differentiation, including skeletal muscle and gut endoderm, as well as the eye tissues. These studies demonstrate the potential value of Artemia for developmental biology studies during spa ceflight, and show that extensive degrees of development can take place in this microgravity environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of impurities in concrete system can possess a damaging effect to the structural integrity of concrete material. Alkali silica reaction, scaling, and corrosion {{are among the}} deleterious effect caused by the ingression of internal or external substance to the concrete system. Sodium chloride or <b>salt</b> is one <b>of</b> the external agents involved in the process; hence its excessive amount in concrete system is strictly prohibited. Nevertheless, concrete containing <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> is generally known for the higher early-strength, yet lower ultimate strength than plain concrete. Meanwhile, study on the detail mechanism in early age properties are scarcely available, particularly at low salt concentration. Therefore this research was conducted to provide better understanding in the effect <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the hardening mechanism of Portland cement paste and to obtain the optimum salt inclusion {{that contributes to the}} enhancement of concrete properties. Analysis on the performance of this reagent was conducted via setting time, compressive strength, and porosity test. Based on the setting time analysis, the inclusion of sodium chloride can extend the initial setting time of cement paste longer than control specimen. Obstruction on the formation of calcium silicate hydrate gel by sodium and chloride ion was one of the possible causes to this phenomenon. Acceleration on the compressive strength development by sodium chloride was also detected. It appears that sodium chloride was able to de-flocculate the coagulated cement particles and reduced the viscosities of cement slurries; hence resulted in faster early hydration process. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that sodium chloride inclusion is beneficial to the workability and compressive strength performance of cement paste binder at certain concentration. Improvement of compressive strength was achieved via faster dissolution and hydration of cement particle due to dispersant characteristic presented by sodium chloride...|$|R

40|$|The Black Sea becomes {{periodically}} {{isolated from}} the global ocean during each glacial period. This occurs when the elevation of the global ocean {{is lower than the}} Bosporus sill, putting a stop <b>to</b> inflow <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the Black Sea. This phenomenon allows the Black Sea to evolve from a marine environment to a freshwater one. It is also evident that the depth of the Bosporus sill does not remain at the same elevation, and instead is dynamic. The sill becomes filled with sediments during periods of its sub-aerial exposure but is subsequently eroded to its bedrock during periods of outflow from the Black Sea-Lake to the global ocean. This interpretation comes from the observations that during the last glacial period, the Black Sea-Lake was in a positive hydrological balance, fresh, and predominantly outflowing to the global ocean over a deep Bosporus sill, at approximately 80 meters below sea level (mbsl). It is highly likely that there were brief periods when the lake froze and the outflow suspended, such as during the extreme stadial conditions associated with the North Atlantic iceberg-discharge Heinrich Event 2 (HE 2) at ~ 24 kyr before present, when there is also no evident carbonate accumulation in stalagmites that receive water from evaporated Black Sea surface water. Upon the onset of deglaciation, large floods originating from the Fennoscandinavian Ice Sheet and the Alps, delivered meltwater so as to fully ventilate the Black Sea-Lake and even potentially replace all of the water in the basin. These floods occurred near the time of the deglacial iceberg-discharge Heinrich Event 1 (HE 1 at ~ 17 kyr before present), and left pulses of red-colored sediment everywhere on the western half of the Black Sea basin...|$|R
