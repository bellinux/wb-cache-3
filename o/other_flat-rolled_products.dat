40|$|The novel, 'edge-restraint rolling' {{method has}} been {{developed}} {{in order to facilitate}} the thickness reduction of brittle, high strength alloys to the degree of thin plates or sheets, by first hot-compacting the prealloyed powders into billets and conducting the thickness reduction in a series of reheats and roll passes. Attention is presently given to the cases of equiatomic aluminide FeAl, (Ni,Fe) 3 Al, and an Al-Fe alloy. The <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>products</b> thus obtained may lead to the development of components not otherwise formable for powerplant and other aerospace applications...|$|R

40|$|Shape {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} {{to determine}} the quality of outgoing <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>products</b> in the steel industry. It is greatly influenced by flatness, a feature to describe how {{the surface of a}} rolled product approaches a plane. Flatness is of the utmost importance in steelmaking, since it is used by most downstream processes and customers for the acceptance or rejection of rolled products. Flatness sensors compute flatness measurements based on comparing the length of several longitudinal fibers of the surface of the product under inspection. Two main different approaches are commonly used. On the one hand, most mechanical sensors measure the tensile stress across the width of the rolled product, while manufacturing and estimating the fiber lengths from this stress. On the other hand, optical sensors measure the length of the fibers by means of light patterns projected onto the product surface. In this paper, we review the techniques and the main sensors used in the steelmaking industry to measure and quantify flatness defects in steel plates, sheets and strips. Most of these techniques and sensors can be used in other industries involving rolling mills or continuous production lines, such as aluminum, copper and paper, to name a few. Encompassed in the special issue, State-of-the-Art Sensors Technology in Spain 2013, this paper also reviews the most important flatness sensors designed and developed for the steelmaking industry in Spain...|$|R

30|$|Steel is the {{material}} of choice for a large number and very diverse industrial applications. Surface qualities along with other properties {{are the most important}} quality parameters, particularly for <b>flat-rolled</b> steel <b>products.</b> Traditional manual surface inspection procedures are awfully inadequate to ensure guaranteed quality-free surface. To ensure stringent requirements of customers, automated vision-based steel surface inspection techniques {{have been found to be}} very effective and popular during the last two decades. Considering its importance, this paper attempts to make the first formal review of state-of-art of vision-based defect detection and classification of steel surfaces as they are produced from steel mills. It is observed that majority of research work has been undertaken for cold steel strip surfaces which is most sensitive to customers' requirements. Work on surface defect detection of hot strips and bars/rods has also shown signs of increase during the last 10  years. The review covers overall aspects of automatic steel surface defect detection and classification systems using vision-based techniques. Attentions have also been drawn to reported success rates along with issues related to real-time operational aspects.|$|R
40|$|Measurement, {{inspection}} and quality control in industry {{have benefited from}} 3 D techniques for imaging and visualization in recent years. The development of machine vision devices at decreased costs, {{as well as their}} miniaturization and integration in industrial processes, have accelerated the use of 3 D imaging systems in industry. In this paper we describe how to improve the performance of a 3 D imaging system for inline dimensional quality inspection of long, <b>flat-rolled</b> metal <b>products</b> manufactured in rolling mills we designed and developed in previous works. Two dimensional characteristics of rolled products are measured by the system: width and flatness. The system is based on active triangulation using a single-line pattern projected onto the surface of the product under inspection for range image acquisition. Taking the system calibration into account the range images are transformed into a calibrated point cloud representing the 3 D surface reconstruction of the product. Two approaches to improve the line detection and extraction method used in the original system are discussed, one intended for high-speed processing with lower accuracy, and the other providing high accuracy while incurring higher computational time expenses. A mechanism to remove, or at least reduce, the effects of product movements while manufacturing, such as bouncing and flapping, is also proposed to improve the performance of the system...|$|R
