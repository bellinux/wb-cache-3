40|$|With {{hundreds}} of millions of pounds spent on digital technology for education every year – from interactive whiteboards to the rise of one–to–one tablet computers – every new technology seems to offer unlimited promise to learning. many sectors have benefitted immensely from harnessing innovative uses of technology. cloud computing, mobile communications and internet applications have changed the way manufacturing, finance, business services, the media and retailers operate. But key questions remain in education: has the range of technologies helped improve learners’ experiences and the standards they achieve? <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> investment <b>just</b> languishing as kit in the cupboard? and what more can decision makers, schools, teachers, parents and the technology industry do to ensure the full potential of innovative technology is exploited? There is no doubt that digital technologies have had a profound impact upon the management of learning. institutions can now recruit, register, monitor, and report on students with a new economy, efficiency, and (sometimes) creativity. yet, evidence of digital technologies producing real transformation in learning and teaching remains elusive. The education sector has invested heavily in digital technology; but this investment has not yet resulted in the radical improvements to learning experiences and educational attainment. in 2011, the Review of Education Capital found that maintained schools spent £ 487 million on icT equipment and services in 2009 - 2010. 1 since then, the education system has entered a state of flux with changes to the curriculum, shifts in funding, and increasing school autonomy. While ring-fenced funding for icT equipment and services has since ceased, a survey of 1, 317 schools in July 2012 by the british educational suppliers association found they were assigning an increasing amount of their budget to technology.

40|$|Knowledge {{production}} and its governance are intertwined with memory on its various forms. The {{development and use}} of Information and Communication Technologies and the hyper-connection entailed have lead to massive content creation, different forms of knowledge and also to humongous amounts of data, that has became known as ‘Big Data’. This digital momentum has generated another hype, that of enhancing our democracies. So, ideas of ‘democratisation’ have been strongly associated with knowledge creation, expertise, civic action, etc., as well to the practices of memory. Whereas Institutions of Memory were tackling with immateriality of contents and trying to find a solution for managing digital memories appropriately, Big Data – defined by Volume, Velocity and Variety in contents’ creation – and the actors behind it, a deeper issue of governance arose: what contextual dimensions entice the digital memories practice? Is (co-) creation of memories actually a democratic practice in the digital context? <b>Or,</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> suggestion <b>just</b> an underhand strategy for making Big Data worth considering? Under the realm of Big Data, who is governing memories? Who is going to set the limits and at what cost? Some authors also include a fourth V for Big Data, which stands for Veracity. It refers to ensure integrated data for doing a good interpretation from it. From a memory perspective, Veracity could also include the concept of trustworthy records. The technical capability of preserving huge amounts of data - instead of applying appropriate appraisal procedures - triggers a lower level of attention to quality of contents and hinders a critical approach to governance of future memories Will Big Data entail a misconception of what <b>are</b> memories <b>or</b> will it ensure a wider representativeness of memories?

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reliably broadcasting information in a multihop asynchronous network, {{despite the presence of}} Byzantine failures: some nodes are malicious and behave arbi-trarly. We focus on non-cryptographic solutions. Most existing approaches give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast (all correct nodes deliver the good information), but require a highly connected network. A probabilistic approach was recently proposed for loosely connected networks: the Byzantine failures are randomly distributed, and the correct nodes deliver the good information with high probability. A first solution require the nodes to initially know their position on the network, which may <b>be</b> difficult <b>or</b> impossible in self-organizing or dynamic networks. A second solution relaxed this hypothesis but has much weaker Byzantine tolerance guarantees. In this paper, we propose a parameterizable broadcast protocol that does not require nodes to have any knowledge about the network. We give a deterministic technique to compute a set of nodes that always deliver authentic information, for a given set of Byzantine failures. Then, we use this technique to experimentally evaluate our protocol, and show that it significantely outperforms previous solutions with the same hypotheses.

This practice has led to poor scholastic attainment, often manifested in high repeat or failure rate, poor performance in examinations, and maladjustment to the world of work. Marginalisation of African languages is an inevitable outcome since they are not used for meaningful education.

Even small countries in Europe use their languages as languages of instruction, even if the children have to learn another language such as English <b>or</b> French. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> not <b>just</b> a matter of national pride; it is a sound educational principle to proceed from the familiar to the new. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> precisely what linguists and educationists have been advocating for Africa. The fears of a multiplicity of languages and the uneconomic cost of teaching in several languages, which are often invoked to counter the feasibility of education in indigenous languages, have been shown to be pseudo problems, as strategies can be, and have been, devised for selection and development of languages as well as for production of teaching materials at relatively reasonable cost (Bamgbose [2009], p. 13).|$|R
40|$|Background A {{positive}} supervisory {{relationship is}} considered essential in ensuring a psychotherapist’s {{safe and effective}} practice. Attachment Theory (AT) {{has been used to}} investigate factors that may impact upon the quality of the supervisory relationship, for trainee psychotherapists. A literature review revealed inconsistent findings as to whether attachment styles of supervisors and supervisees were associated with the quality of the alliance, suggesting an incomplete understanding the attachment-supervision construct. Objectives To improve our understanding of the attachment-supervision construct, this study aimed to explore, in-depth, how supervisees experienced and understood the supervisory relationship and to explore what within <b>this</b> may <b>be</b> relevant to AT. Method Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to interview and analyse data from seven trainee clinical psychologists (supervisees). Results Several participant experiences resonated with AT, including the supervisor demonstrating secure attachment figure qualities, which help the supervisee feel worthwhile. Rather than the supervisory relationship merely being influenced by past infant-caregiver attachment, it appears that there is the potential for a new attachment to form, similar to the freshness of an infant-caregiver attachment. However, unlike an infant, the supervisee has more influence over the attachment, in a collaborative effort with the supervisor, where the relationship seems to benefit from a goodness-of-fit between both relational styles. Non-attachment factors such as reciprocal disclosure were also important in the supervisory relationship. Conclusion Overall, AT appears a useful way to think about the supervisory relationship, particularly for inexperienced trainees. However, as trainee clinical psychologists are trained to think in attachment terms, it remains unclear whether the supervisory relationship is truly a “full-blown” attachment relationship (rather than one consisting of attachment dynamics), <b>or</b> whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the way that trainees approach it. Regardless, the findings suggest that the supervisory alliance may be improved via supervisor attunement to supervisee needs...|$|R
