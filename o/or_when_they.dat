5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee <b>or,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|Daimler-Benz and Krupp {{were the}} main {{builders}} of the Sd.Kfz. 8 during the war, but Krauss-Maffei produced 315 in 1940—41 and Škoda joined {{in the last years}} of the war. 1615 were on hand on 20 December 1942. 507 were built in 1943 and 602 in 1944. Approximately 4000 were built in total. The Sd.Kfz. 8 was used by Czechoslovakia after the war, but it is not known if production continued at Škoda <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were finally discarded.|$|E

The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} foil any {{plans for a}} coup d'état, the {{president}} {{took control of the}} military and police, reducing their numbers from 5,300 to 3,500. Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that, pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961, were stationed at Port-Bouët and could intervene at Houphouët-Boigny's request <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> considered French interests to be threatened. They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|Regulations {{require that}} {{scientists}} use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering {{to be the}} central issue and see animal euthanasia {{as a way to}} reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E

5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given {{at the moment when}} the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E
