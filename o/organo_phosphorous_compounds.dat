40|$|Much of the {{experimental}} work on vapor phase lubrication has employed certain <b>organo</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> as the vapor phase lubricant. Graham and Klaus, for instance, used tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and tributyl phosphate to vapor phase lubricate a four-ball wear tester using M 50 steel balls at 370 C. Makki and Graham were able to vapor phase lubricate a reciprocating pin on plate tribometer using 1018 steel at 280 C with TCP vapor. Although a few <b>organo</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as TCP, have been successfully used as vapor phase lubricants in many laboratory experiments, many problems remain unsolved. Two areas of concern relate to the 'durability' of phosphate deposited films and {{to the ability of}} the lubricating system to "self-recover" when vapor phase lubricated with an organo phosphorous compound. Durability refers to the ability of the deposited film to provide effective lubrication, for a period of time, after the vapor flow to the lubricating surfaces has been interrupted. Vapor phase lubrication tests, conducted at Cleveland State University with their high temperature tribometer, revealed that when TCP vapor flow to the lubricating surfaces was interrupted the frictional coefficient of the system rapidly increased from a value less than 0. 1 to a value of 0. 3 which was selected as our failure point. Self-recovery means the ability of the vapor phase lubricant to reduce the frictional coefficient of the lubricating system back down to value less than 0. 1 after startup of the interrupted vapor flow. Lubrication tests conducted at Cleveland State University revealed that the high temperature tribometer could not self-recover after startup of the interrupted TCP vapor flow...|$|E

40|$|Transformation of the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> in Lake Balaton was {{described}} in the mathematical model BALSECT (Balaton Sector Model). This model, which deals with five types of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> [...] dissolved inorganic P, dissolved organic P, nonliving particulate organic P, bacterial P, and phytoplankton P [...] reflects the basic interactions between these compounds {{in accordance with the}} consecutive conversion of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> in the water environment. The rates of change in the phosphorous transformation processes are modeled to be dependent on and regulated by environmental factors such as temperature, radiation, water balance, and nutrient watershed load. The model also takes into account the wind action on the horizontal interbasin transport of phosphorus as well as phosphorous exchange between sediment and water. The measurements of temperature, radiation, wind, water balance, and phosphorous loading were used to examine the feasibility of the model in reproducing the phosphorous dynamics in the fourth basin of Lake Balaton for the environmental conditions of 1976 - 1978. The improved version of the possible watershed nutrient loading was used in this study. On the basis of the analysis of the turnover time values, the details of the cycling of the individual <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and the total P are presented in this report. The explanation of the trends in the phosphorous cycling in the terms of turnover time is considered useful and important for understanding the regime of the phosphorous transformation within the Lake Balaton Ecosystem for the different environmental conditions and changeable nutrient loading. Thus, the simulation results and calculated values of turnover time may be used for the formulation of suggestions concerning the water quality management of this lake...|$|R

40|$|All cells contain {{much more}} potassium, phosphate, and {{transition}} metals than modern (or reconstructed primeval) oceans, lakes, or rivers. Cells maintain ion gradients by using sophisticated, energy-dependent membrane enzymes (membrane pumps) that {{are embedded in}} elaborate ion-tight membranes. The first cells could possess neither ion-tight membranes nor membrane pumps, so the concentrations of small inorganic molecules and ions within protocells and in their environment would equilibrate. Hence, the ion composition of modern cells might reflect the inorganic ion composition of the habitats of protocells. We attempted to reconstruct the “hatcheries” of the first cells by combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. These ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K+, Zn 2 +, Mn 2 +, and phosphate. Thus, protocells must have evolved in habitats with a high K+/Na+ ratio and relatively high concentrations of Zn, Mn, and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of inland geothermal systems.

40|$|A microflame-based {{detector}} suit {{has been}} developed for sensing of {{a broad range of}} chemical analytes. This detector combines calorimetry, flame ionization detection (FID), nitrogen-phosphorous detection (NPD) and flame photometric detection (FPD) modes into one convenient platform based on a microcombustor. The microcombustor consists in a micromachined microhotplate with a catalyst or low-work function material added to its surface. For the NPD mode a low work function material selectively ionizes chemical analytes; for all other modes a supported catalyst such as platinum/alumina is used. The microcombustor design permits rapid, efficient heating of the deposited film at low power. To perform calorimetric detection of analytes, the change in power required to maintain the resistive microhotplate heater at a constant temperature is measured. For FID and NPD modes, electrodes are placed around the microcombustor flame zone and an electrometer circuit measures the production of ions. For FPD, the flame zone is optically interrogated to search for light emission indicative of deexcitation of flame-produced analyte compounds. The calorimetric and FID modes respond generally to all hydrocarbons, while sulfur compounds only alarm in the calorimetric mode, providing speciation. The NPD mode provides 10, 000 : 1 selectivity of nitrogen and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> over hydrocarbons. The FPD can distinguish between sulfur and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Importantly all detection modes can be established on one convenient microcombustor platform, in fact the calorimetric, FID and FPD modes can be achieved simultaneously on only one microcombustor. Therefore, it is possible to make a very universal chemical detector array with as little as two microcombustor elements.

Homogeneous dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the polyurethane resin was obtained by sonification, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Flammability tests of fabrics coated by modified polyurethane resin were carried out using pyrolysis combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) and thermal stability of textiles was evaluated. Also, organoleptic estimation of coatings was conducted (flexibility and fragility). The use of polymer nanocomposites with phophorus flame retardants as a back-coating for textiles effectively reduces flammability and improves thermal stability of the fabric. Furthermore, the synergistic effect beetwen carbon nanotubes and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compound</b> occurs. The resulting coatings are flexible and do not crack or change the feel of fabrics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{efficiency}} of hydroxyl radical {{in the treatment of}} wastewater was investigated. Hydroxyl radical was generated through Fenton reagent. The main objective {{of this study was to}} perform the oxidation treatment of selected wastewater in order to increase their biological treatability, expressed as the ratio of BOD 5 to COD. Two selected organic wastewater were studied: tannery wastewater and landfill leachate. An inorganic solution containing a mixture of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> was also studied, in order to verify hydroxyl radical activity towards an inorganic substrate. Experimental tests were carried out at room temperature and in acid conditions. Data obtained showed that, in the treatment of organic substrates, hydroxyl radical, because of its high oxidation potential, acts the conversion of recalcitrant compounds in biodegradable ones, so increasing the BOD 5 value of the wastewater but decreasing the oxygen chemical demand. The biological treatability was so increased. At the same time, the oxidation of phosphite and hypophosphite rapidly occurs, and an oxidation rate higher than 98 % of the initial total phosphorous was achieved in different conditions...|$|R
