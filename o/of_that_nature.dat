25|$|Public {{disorder}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>nature</b> was renewed {{during the}} industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, which was coupled with falling living standards and starvation. In 1819, mass meetings calling for Parliamentary reform took place across England, including 60,000 demonstrators rioting in Manchester where a special constable was killed. In light of these events, in 1820, an Act was passed allowing magistrates to recruit men as special constables.|$|E

25|$|Though gender {{discrimination}} and sexism refer to beliefs and attitudes {{in relation to}} the gender of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>nature</b> is considered a form of prejudice and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{department}} had serious problems: The dispatching system {{could not identify}} {{the exact location of}} structures like the United States Capitol or the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dispatchers sent crews to the wrong locations or in the wrong directions, firefighters didn't know how to use life-saving emergency equipment such as defibrillators, injuries to civilians during fires were on the increase, fire engines and ambulances were having more accidents while responding to calls, and ambulances took twice as long to respond to calls (11 minutes and 21 seconds) than the national average. The training structures at the fire academy were in serious disrepair, trainees were found extensively cheating on tests, there were equipment and employee shortages, and equipment was old and in disrepair. Three firefighters died in 1999 in two months, creating a deep morale problem. (Prior to the incidents, just a single firefighter had died in 11 years.) Few had little experience overseeing the provision of emergency medical care, although 80 percent of calls in D.C. were <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>nature.</b> Few was also only the second fire chief hired from outside the department, and had extremely poor relations with the firefighter's union.|$|E

500|$|The three {{charities}} {{that were}} to benefit were prisoners' debt relief, the Mercer's Hospital, and the Charitable Infirmary. In its report on a public rehearsal, the Dublin News-Letter described the oratorio as [...] "...far surpass anything <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>Nature</b> which has been performed in {{this or any other}} Kingdom". Seven hundred people attended the premiere on 13 April. So that the largest possible audience could be admitted to the concert, gentlemen were requested to remove their swords, and ladies were asked not to wear hoops in their dresses. [...] The performance earned unanimous praise from the assembled press: [...] "Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring and crouded Audience". A Dublin clergyman, Rev. Delaney, was so overcome by Susanna Cibber's rendering of [...] "He was despised" [...] that reportedly he leapt to his feet and cried: [...] "Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven thee!"

One of the scenes that was cut involved one of the thieves phasing through a safe wall, and acting as a portal for the merchandise to be passed through. When digital effects were not an option, Mike Walls, the physical effects supervisor who began his Smallville career with [...] "Leech", still tried to provide big effects.

500|$|The next type of uncertainty, ascertainability, {{is where}} it is {{impossible}} to find the beneficiaries, either because they have died, moved or changed names. This is not necessarily fatal; the test for deciding if it is or not was laid out by Wynn-Parry J as: [...] "mere difficulty of ascertainment is not of itself fatal to the validity of the gift. As has been pointed out, {{it is a matter of}} degree, and it is only when one reaches, on the evidence, a conclusion that it is so vague or that the difficulty is so great that it must be treated as virtually incapable of resolution, that one is entitled, to my mind, to say that a gift <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>nature</b> is void for uncertainty". If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin, which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead. The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability — where the trust is, by its very nature, so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties. Where this prevents the trustees carrying out their duties, the trust will be declared invalid, and not applied.|$|E

De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished".

De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>nature,</b> not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J.

[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned {{in a number of}} states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that.
