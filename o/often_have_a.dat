5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|People with {{infectious}} pneumonia <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> productive cough, fever {{accompanied by}} shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, {{and an increased}} rate of breathing. In the elderly, confusion {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
5|$|Senators may {{be members}} of joint {{committees}}: committees jointly established by both chambers of the Australian parliament. In addition, political parties will often have caucus committees comprising members of the parliamentary party; these committees will <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> policy focus, but are not committees of the parliament and are not bound by any of parliament's rules of procedures.|$|E

5|$|The Westerosi {{characters}} of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently) with the accent of the English region {{corresponding to the}} character's Westerosi region; Eddard Stark (Warden of the North) speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern accent, and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern accent, while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent. Characters foreign to Westeros <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> non-British accent.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{a common}} place for the spread of tumors {{from other parts of}} the body. Secondary cancers are {{classified}} by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also became convinced {{that there is no}} fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.|$|E

5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{high enough}} {{center of mass}} and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Compulsory {{education}} {{is divided into}} ten years. Schools which have all ten years, year one to seven, and years eight to ten are common. Those schools which teach from years eight to ten <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wider catchment area. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the Reykjavík urban area, schools can be up to 1200 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can have fewer than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools have fewer than 100 pupils. All compulsory education institutions are mixed sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; psychological counselling is also available.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s, Flemish {{literature}} {{began to}} reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish, the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s {{until his death in}} 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks ("Of Today and Tomorrow") was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium. Flemish literature continued to flourish in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels.|$|E

5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> history of poor adjustment {{before the onset of}} illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS <b>often</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
