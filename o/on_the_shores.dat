40|$|This study {{examined}} {{patterns in the}} distribution and demography of the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus (Poli) at different spatial scales in the northwest Mediterranean. Preliminary data indicated that the abundance and size of barnacles decreased from high-shore to low-shore habitats. The generality of these patterns was investigated at several locations (10 s to 100 s of km apart), at several sites within locations (100 s to 1000 s of m apart) and at different times, patterns {{were consistent with the}} preliminary observations, despite considerable spatial and temporal variability at small and large spatial scales. The following models were proposed to explain the observed patterns: (1) recruitment was intrinsically greater high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> (2) limitation of recruitment due to pre-emption of the substratum was greater low than high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> (3) environmental conditions reduce growth low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> and (4) mortality was greater low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> <b>The</b> predictions of these models were tested by examining patterns of recruitment, growth and mortality of barnacles and availability of free space in relation to height <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> at several spatial scales and through time. Successful recruitment of barnacles was observed at different heights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> where resident organisms were removed, despite a trend toward a larger number of recruits high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> at 1 location (Livorno). Availability of bare rock for recruitment was greater high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> implying that pre-emption of the substratum was more intense low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> There was no evidence to suggest that barnacles grew faster <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high <b>shore</b> than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low <b>shore.</b> <b>The</b> opposite pattern was observed for young barnacles in several cases. Mortality rates were generally greater in low-shore than high-shore habitats for young and for adult barnacles. Patterns emerged over a background of considerable spatial and temporal variation. These results emphasized the importance of pre-emption of space and mortality of juveniles in generating patterns in the distribution and structure of populations of barnacles <b>on</b> rocky <b>shores</b> in <b>the</b> northwest Mediterranean...|$|R

40|$|Patterns of {{abundance}} of epifaunal crustaceans were compared between two common brown algae in intertidal rock pools on a shore near Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Amphipods {{were significantly more}} abundant on Sargassum globulariaefolium (which was most common low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore)</b> than <b>on</b> Hormosira banksii (more common at mid-shore levels). Experiments tested the hypotheses that height <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> and structural complexity of the algae were the main factors influencing patterns {{of abundance}} of amphipods. Reciprocal transplants using defaunated plants and similar experiments using artificial plants allowed simultaneous tests of these hypotheses. The abundance of a common intertidal amphipod, Sunampithoe graxon was significantly smaller on Sargassum transferred from low to mid-tidal level of <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> than <b>on</b> any other treatments, indicating that height <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> affects numbers of this species. There were no Sunampithoe on Hormosira even when transplanted to low shore areas, indicating that other factors, apart from <b>the</b> height <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> are also important for this amphipod. Another common amphipod, Hyale maroubrae was generally found in greatest abundances on Hormosira transplanted from mid- to low shore and on Sargassum low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> again indicating <b>the</b> importance of height <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> There {{was no difference in}} abundance of amphipods on 'complex' and 'simple' artificial plants indicating that structural complexity (as defined in this study) did not influence these amphipods...|$|R
