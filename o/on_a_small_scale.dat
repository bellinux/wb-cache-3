5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> A monthly magazine was also produced, though towards the end of Live & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast {{shortly after his}} arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 57% of the Island's {{area was}} {{agricultural}} land (an increase on 2008). Major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce; agriculture's share of GVA increased 5% in 2009, a fifth successive year of growth. Jersey cattle {{are a small}} breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream; {{the quality of its}} meat is also appreciated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> The herd total in 2009 was 5,090 animals. Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey's marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more}} likely to eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} a trade hall in Wetherby in 1710 brought about further {{industrial}} development, most of this was still <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> until the 19th century, but Leeds like Manchester began to show growing industrialisation before many other towns and cities across the industrial belts of Yorkshire and Lancashire did, providing Leeds with a few rare examples of industry from before the period that is generally accepted {{as the beginning of}} the industrial revolution (late 18th century) had begun.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{by groups}} of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} reservoirs reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village. The weaving industry was mechanised, small mines closed and the population declined further when properties in the village were demolished in the early 20th century. Agriculture, mainly sheep farming, continues although <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> Tourism at Rivington began in Victorian times and after the reservoirs were filled in the 1860s {{was known as the}} Little Lake District. Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904. From the late Victorian period until the mid-20th century tourists from Bolton travelled on day trips by tram along Chorley New Road and then on to Rivington on foot, many more visitors arrived by train.|$|E
