5|$|The agency's Small Investment Program aims {{to promote}} FDI into {{specifically}} small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except {{it does not}} cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance premiums and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15million and annual revenues not to exceed $15million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10million, and will guarantee <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to 10years with a possible 5-year extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} {{church was}} well prepared for defence, but its garrison was by then composed {{almost entirely of}} the wounded. By noon the defenders were overpowered, and the Russians entered the church. The fight for Fort 56 was over. Altogether the Russian side lost no less than 1,000 killed in action during the storming of the fort. Polish casualties did not exceed 300 killed and wounded, with 1,230 soldiers and officers taken prisoner. <b>Only</b> <b>up</b> to 500 soldiers managed to withdraw and reach Polish lines.|$|E
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E

5|$|Zaprešić lies {{along the}} left {{bank of the}} Sava River, {{but it does not}} have any bridges that would connect the town to Samobor, on the other bank, as the nearest bridge is the Podsused bridge, located in the Podsused – Vrapče {{district}} of Zagreb. However, two ferries connect Zaprešić with the roads in Medsave and Samoborski Otok, small villages near Samobor. The widest river in the area, the Sava River, used to be navigable up to Krško, Slovenia in Roman times. However, it is, , navigable <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to Rugvica, leaving Zaprešić with no more possibility of river transport. The city does not have a port on any of its rivers.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were <b>only</b> <b>up</b> 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E

5|$|At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the {{hurricane}} made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). It started weakening {{early the next}} day after encountering the Sierra Maestra mountain range and moving southwestward, away from the coast. Steered by persistent high-pressure ridging over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path {{for the remainder of}} its duration in open waters. It brushed Cuba's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica. On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's eye fell to , its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to , but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day. It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios on the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, {{the hurricane}} crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall. The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal. The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The 179th Street station (drawn up as 178th Street) {{had been}} planned {{along with the rest}} of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as its {{original}} terminus as early as 1928. In December 1930, however, it was planned to construct stations <b>only</b> <b>up</b> to 169th Street, with tail tracks and switches installed up to the foot of the station at 178th Street, along with a provision for the station. The tracks ended at bumper blocks, and the tunnel at a bulkhead. Under these plans, the 178th Street station would be built during a further eastward extension. The Queens Boulevard Line was extended up to 169th Street on April 24, 1937, with the tail tracks and switches used to store and reverse trains.|$|E
