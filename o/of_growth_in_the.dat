5|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the late}} 1880s were a period <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system {{became an important}} source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} the economic impact <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|Enron's stock {{increased}} {{from the start}} of the 1990s until year-end 1998 by 311%, only modestly higher than the average rate <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Standard & Poor 500 index. However, the stock increased by 56% in 1999 and a further 87% in 2000, compared to a 20% increase and a 10% decrease for the index during the same years. By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was priced at $83.13 and its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion, 70 times earnings and six times book value, an indication of the stock market's high expectations about its future prospects. In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in Fortunes Most Admired Companies survey.|$|E

5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the state}} {{legislature}} appropriated $1.3 million to build rail lines from Madison, Indiana, to Lafayette, Indiana, {{as part of the}} Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836, the Madison and Indianapolis, the first steam railroad in Indiana, did not arrive in Indianapolis until October 1, 1847. By 1850 eight rail lines reached the city, ending its isolation {{from the rest of the}} country and ushering in a new era <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1850s Indianapolis became a transportation hub for the region, which helped improve the city's commercial trade, increase property values, and encourage further development. Indianapolis's first Union railroad depot, the first of its kind in the United States to serve competing railroads, opened in 1853. Rail transportation spurred further improvements to city streets. In 1853 several blocks of Washington Street were the first in the city to be illuminated with gaslight street lamps; in 1859 a section between Illinois and Meridian Streets became the city's first roadways to be paved with cobblestones.|$|E
