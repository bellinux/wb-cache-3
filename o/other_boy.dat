25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the <b>other</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Season two {{begins with}} the end of summer school. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly {{on the first day of}} school after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also {{revealed}} that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of Teddy Montgomery, Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is different from any <b>other</b> <b>boy</b> Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age. Navid and Adrianna's relationship continues to tremble when Adrianna continues to find Teddy alluring. In the meantime, Harry and Debbie face marital problems when Harry confides to Kelly about his family troubles. Naomi finds out that her SAT scores are not high enough to get into California University, so she decides to date the Dean of Admission's son, Richard. She later falls for Richard's roommate, Jamie. Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.|$|E
500|$|Between July 2 and September 11, 1892, Crane {{published}} {{at least}} ten news reports on Asbury Park affairs. [...] Although a Tribune colleague stated that Crane [...] "was not highly distinguished above any <b>other</b> <b>boy</b> of twenty who had gained a reputation for saying and writing bright things," [...] that summer his reporting took on a more skeptical, hypocrisy-deflating tone. [...] A storm of controversy erupted over a report he wrote on the Junior Order of United American Mechanics' American Day Parade, entitled [...] "Parades and Entertainments". [...] Published on August 21, the report juxtaposes the [...] "bronzed, slope-shouldered, uncouth" [...] marching men [...] "begrimed with dust" [...] and the spectators dressed in [...] "summer gowns, lace parasols, tennis trousers, straw hats and indifferent smiles". [...] Believing they were being ridiculed, some JOUAM marchers were outraged and wrote to the editor. [...] The owner of the Tribune, Whitelaw Reid, was that year's Republican vice-presidential candidate, and this likely increased {{the sensitivity of the}} paper's management to the issue. Although Townley wrote a piece for the Asbury Park Daily Press in his brother's defense, the Tribune quickly apologized to its readers, calling Stephen Crane's piece [...] "a bit of random correspondence, passed inadvertently by the copy editor". [...] Hamlin Garland and biographer John Barry attested that Crane told them he had been dismissed by the Tribune, although Willis Fletcher Johnson later denied this. [...] The paper did not publish any of Crane's work after 1892.|$|E

Bieber regained the record {{with the release of}} the music video for [...] "Beauty and a Beat" [...] (10.6 million) on 12 October 2012. It received positive reviews from music critics, who generally complimented its carefree, jubilant nature. Smith quipped that it has [...] "notable moments," [...] which he cited, [...] "glowstick campfire dances, inflatable pool splashing, four wheeler racing, and an unfortunate blonde streak in Zayn 's hair." [...] The Hollywood Reporter writer Sophie A. Schillaci called it [...] "fun-filled", and concluded that the video perfectly accompanies the track's lyricism. Lansky called the [...] "high quality" [...] clip [...] "fairly standard 1D fare", elaborating: [...] "the boys get up to some teenage shenanigans and, well, live while they’re young. When their festivities culminate in a pool party that reads more like a wet t-shirt contest than anything else, it's abundantly clear that 1D knows their audience." [...] The Huffington Post characterised it as an [...] "epic summer adventure", assessing: [...] "from a camping trip to the ultimate beach party, complete with a shirtless Niall [...] and inflatable banana." [...] Collins described it as featuring the group [...] "doing what they do best — scampering, singing, scampering some more." [...] ITN's Lindsay Brown viewed the video as [...] "wholesome", showing them [...] "having some good old fashioned fun." [...] Fuse editor Nicole James praised the apparent recurring trend of [...] "how the group isn't afraid to make fun of themselves." [...] James elaborated: [...] "If it were any <b>other</b> <b>boy</b> band acting out the Monkees-inspired hijinks in 1D's new video [...] "Live While We're Young," [...] it would likely come off as super cheesy. But for these five guys, their sense of comfortable self-awareness really comes through." [...] As of October 2017, the video has over 550 million views.The music video also looks like similar to Big Time Rush's song [...] "Windows Down" [...] music video ...|$|E

It was here that he developed a love for horses which was to remain with him {{for the rest of his}} life. He got on well with the circus people, who let him ride the horses at rehearsals. The acrobats and trapeze artists, too, were his friends and he learned many of their tricks. At 18 he could do a double somersault between two trapezes – quite a feat.|$|E

This {{was followed by the}} Greatest Hits compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the Bee Gees' [...] "How Deep Is Your Love". The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 at Amsterdam. Following the band's announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the government to deal with counselling them. After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from <b>other</b> <b>boy</b> bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow, the only boy band member who won an Ivor Novello award during his time in a boy band (although George Michael won it while in Wham!). Take That had also left a legacy of being immaculate performers with a very high work ethic, causing them to be voted in as the greatest boy band of all time.|$|E
