5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found.|$|E
50|$|This slow-growing plant forms {{clusters}} of dark green leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> where it grows. It produces white or yellow flowers {{in spring and}} then {{clusters of}} fleshy black fruits. A tough and adaptable plant that easily survives seasonal fires, Brandblaar grows in shady spots in Cape Fynbos, along the coast, in afro-montane forest and just about anywhere else - throughout the Cape Floristic Region, from Cape Town eastwards as far as Grahamstown.|$|R

50|$|Positive {{advantages}} of this practical method of forest management {{was that the}} ash left behind fertilized <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> trees and plants and bark beetles which are ravishing so much of <b>the</b> Western <b>Forests</b> were killed before boring into trees. Pinecones were also liberated by the heat to release their seeds into the soil. In the spring natural grasses provided extensive grazing opportunities for livestock and wildlife inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> regions and also provided critical anti-erosion during heavy rains. To return <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to such pristine grandness will require extensive planning to remove the more dense fuel loads and careful prescribed burns to liquidate remaining pockets of heavy fuels left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> by 70 years of neglect.|$|R
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E

50|$|Desmognathus wrighti is {{typically}} a light brown color with a dorsal pigmentation pattern of inverted V’s in a darker brown. The salamander ranges from 35 mm to 55 mm and rarely exceeds 50 mm {{making it the}} smallest salamander in the genus Desmognathus. Pygmy salamanders are typically found at higher elevations. Adult salamanders are active at night and have been found up to one meter above the ground in vegetation. The pygmy salamander is the most terrestrial species of its genus. It lives in depressions in moss and leaf litter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> and is most often found in spruce-fir forests of high elevation. The salamander goes to seepages and stream banks for egg-laying in summer and early autumn.|$|R
50|$|Monterey pine is {{a species}} adapted {{to cope with}} stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by {{the heat of a}} <b>forest</b> fire; <b>the</b> {{abundant}} seeds are then discharged to regenerate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> burned <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> cones may also burst open in hot weather.|$|R
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> in deciduous woodland.|$|E
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
50|$|It is a shy and {{difficult}} tinamou {{to be seen}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Its call is a three-note call and lower than other tinamous. Its calls can be in long bouts, up to five hours at a time. This tinamou and the thicket tinamou will produce hybrids on occasion.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Flora== The ice {{fields of}} tundra are covered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top by lichens, mosses, grasses and flowers, which {{for nine months}} are buried under snow. There {{are only a few}} trees and bushes here which are in a twisted dwarfed {{condition}} as their roots can not penetrate the permafrost. <b>The</b> taiga <b>forest</b> is densely populated with spruces, firs, pines and larch. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> grass, moss, lichen, berries and mushrooms are reported. The steppe consists of croplands and grass lands. In the Volga Delta, Caspian lotus flowers in pink and white spread across the water during the summer. The Caucasus region has 6,000 plant species of various types including wild flowers. In Ussuriland, there exists a lush monsoon forest quite different from <b>the</b> taiga <b>forest,</b> and in this, the trees and undergrowth are draped with lianas and vines.|$|R
50|$|Ubiquitous termite, {{scientific}} name unknown, an African termite {{that comes in}} many different species that lives <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tropical <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> constantly attacking <b>the</b> vegetable material <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground (also doing this are microorganisms).

5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game. As {{is typical of}} most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> or lethal monsters hiding in the shadows, such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the {{subfamily}} Aviculariinae, which are arboreal, E. murinus lives mainly <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> where it will build a heavily-webbed burrow beneath the topsoil or amongst branches, rocks, and other <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> debris.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 800 species of rain frogs that exist, and 8 of them are found in Belize. They vary in size, from the Maya Rain Frog which is about 2.5-3.5 cm (1 in), to the Central American Rain Frog which can be 9 cm (3.5 in) long. Rain frogs are usually terrestrial, {{so they can be}} found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors,</b> in or near pools, ponds, and streams. They are {{different}} from tree frogs in their color; usually having more earth tones with dark markings on their backs and legs. Out of more than 700 species of tree frogs, 12 of them can be found in Belize. Unlike rain frogs, they have more bright colors such as orange, blue, red and yellow to warn predators that they are poisonous. Tree Frogs, like their name, are most commonly found in trees. Despite their skinny legs, they are very good jumpers and climbers.|$|R
40|$|Mushroom {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} biodiversity components for both ecological and economic point of view. It deserves not only the good sources of nutrients, medicine but also has key function in nutrient recycling and niche for several animal resources.  Eastern lateritic part of India with its distinct seasonality and undulated topography, harbours mosaic macro fungal resources <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floors</b> with distinct spatio-temporal variation. Among 18 species related to tribal use, the most usable species were Astraeus hygrometricus Amanita vaginata var. alba, Amanita banangiana, Russula Nigerians, Termitomyces eurhizus, Termitomyces microcarpus etc. During monsoon and post monsoon period, second half of August is the optimum time for 11 wild edible mushrooms. Out of total production 47. 2 % production was taken place at that time. These regions with its tribal population, especially the Santals in <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> fringes, were very potential for traditional knowledge related to mushrooms. This paper deals with ethnic pattern of utilization in relation to spatio-temporal distribution of macro fungal diversity, its habitat and traditional tribal knowledge in ecology, use and others...|$|R
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming {{the shape of a}} wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, which produce white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus {{within the}} Pezizaceae family. It is a {{monotypic}} genus, containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria, {{commonly known as}} the pink crown, the violet crown-cup, or the violet star cup. It is a whitish or grayish cup fungus, distinguished by {{the manner in which the}} cup splits into lobes from the top downward. It is commonly found in the mountains in coniferous woods under humus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> and often appears after the snow melts in late spring and early summer. The fungus is widespread, and has been collected in Europe, Israel and the Asian part of Turkey, North Africa, and North America. In Europe, it is considered a threatened species in 14 countries. Although several taxa have been described as Sarcosphaera species since the introduction of the genus in 1869, most lack modern descriptions, have been transferred to the related genus Peziza, or are considered synonymous with S.coronaria.|$|E
25|$|The forest-suited {{form was}} Kalobatippus (or Miohippus intermedius, {{depending}} on {{whether it was a}} new genus or species), whose second and fourth front toes were long, well-suited travel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>forest</b> <b>floors.</b> Kalobatippus probably gave rise to Anchitherium, which travelled to Asia via the Bering Strait land bridge, and from there to Europe. In both North America and Eurasia, larger-bodied genera evolved from Anchitherium: Sinohippus in Eurasia and Hypohippus and Megahippus in North America. Hypohippus became extinct by the late Miocene.|$|R
50|$|The brown mesite is a humid forest species, it forages {{by walking}} through <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> {{flicking}} over leaf-litter {{in order to}} find invertebrates. Its rufous brown plumage provides reasonable camouflage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shady <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> preferred habitat is undisturbed deciduous forest from sea-level up to 1200 m. One to three eggs are laid in a nest which consists of a loose platform made from twigs and lined with plant fibre and leaves. The eggs are dull white with brown markings on one end. Soon after hatching the chicks leave the nest. It is secretive and rarely seen.The brown mesite has never been observed flying; this may be simply due to its secretive habits, or it may be because it is in fact flightless.|$|R
5000|$|Rhytidiadelphus loreus, also {{commonly}} known as Lanky Moss, is a nonvascular [...] "feather moss" [...] species that is {{a key component of}} a healthy, thriving forest ecosystem. Lanky Moss grows in North America, Canada and Europe. It is primarily a coastal species that grows in moist, coniferous forests. It grows <b>on</b> decaying logs, <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> and as an epiphyte on living trees. Its key function is nitrogen fixation, water retention and temperature insulator.|$|R
5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was {{non-migratory}} and {{is thought}} to have lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near Choiseul Bay {{in the northern part of}} the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita, and it is suspected that it may once have lived on Bougainville Island. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor,</b> and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
50|$|The {{fan-tailed warbler}} (Basileuterus lachrymosus) is a New World warbler in the genus Basileuterus that lives along the Pacific slope from {{northern}} Mexico to Nicaragua. Vagrant records exist for Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It is yellow on its throat and underparts with a tawny wash <b>on</b> its chest. <b>The</b> head is gray with a black-framed yellow crown and white around the eyes. The undertail coverlets are white. They are 5.8-6.3 in (14.5-16 cm) long and have pleasant, upslurred song. Fan-tailed warblers {{live in and}} {{at the edge of}} evergreen and semideciduous forest, especially near ravines. They eat ants, especially army ants, and are seen hopping around <b>on</b> either <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor</b> or close to it. They are found alone or in pairs.|$|R
60|$|The very forest-fringed earth {{seemed to}} have opened into a deep abyss, ribbed by red rock walls and choked by steep mats of green timber. The chasm was a V-shaped split and so deep that looking {{downward}} sent at once a chill and a shudder over Carley. At that point it appeared narrow and ended in a box. In the other direction, it widened and deepened, and stretched farther on between tremendous walls of red, and split its winding floor of green with glimpses of a gleaming creek, bowlder-strewn and ridged by white rapids. A low mellow roar of rushing waters floated up to Carley's ears. What a wild, lonely, terrible place! Could Glenn possibly live down there in that ragged rent in the earth? It frightened her--the sheer sudden plunge {{of it from the}} heights. Far down the gorge a purple light shone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> <b>floor.</b> And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moment the sun burst through the clouds and sent a golden blaze down into the depths, transforming them incalculably. The great cliffs turned gold, the creek changed to glancing silver, the green of trees vividly freshened, and in the clefts rays of sunlight burned into the blue shadows. Carley had never gazed upon a scene like this. Hostile and prejudiced, she yet felt wrung from her an acknowledgment of beauty and grandeur. But wild, violent, savage! Not livable! This insulated rift in the crust of the earth was a gigantic burrow for beasts, perhaps for outlawed men--not for a civilized person--not for Glenn Kilbourne.|$|R
50|$|Territorial defense {{involves}} a male flying or perching {{in a spot}} of sunlight that pierces through <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> canopy. <b>The</b> speckled wood butterfly spends the night {{high up in the}} trees, and territorial activity commences once sunlight passes through the canopy. The males often remain in the same sunspot until the evening, following the sunspot as it moves across <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> males often perch <b>on</b> vegetation near <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>floor.</b> If a female flies into the territory, the resident male flies after her, the pair drops to the ground, and copulation follows.
