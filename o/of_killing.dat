5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
