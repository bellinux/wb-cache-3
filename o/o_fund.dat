40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a time domain {{approach}} for traffic identification problems in ATM networks, for which we propose to identify a Markov modulated Poisson process and a circulant Markov modulated Poisson process, based on unconstrained optimisation algorithms. By applying a nonnegative least squares algorithm we obtain in a very fast way a description of the first order statistics of the data. This first order characterisation also includes an estimate for the model order. Consequently, we manage to identify a Markov modulated Poisson process without a priori knowledge of the model order. Keywords: traffic identification, Markov modulated Poisson process, mixture distributions, ATM, subspace identification, parameter estimation. 1 Research Assistant with the I. W. T.

40|$|Leishmania infantum is a {{protozoan}} parasite that is phagocytized {{by human}} macrophages. The host macrophages kill the parasite by generating oxidative compounds that induce DNA damage. We have identified, purified and biochemically characterized a DNA polymerase θ from L. infantum (LiPolθ), demonstrating {{that it is}} a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis of 8 oxoG, abasic sites and thymine glycol lesions. Stably transfected L. infantum parasites expressing LiPolθ were significantly more resistant to oxidative and interstrand cross-linking agents, e. g. hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and mitomycin C. Moreover, LiPolθ-overexpressing parasites showed an increased infectivity toward its natural macrophage host. Therefore, we propose that LiPolθ is a translesion synthesis polymerase involved in parasite DNA damage tolerance, to confer resistance against macrophage aggression.

The author’ s main intention is to present the legal regulations concerning the activity of those institutions, their offer addressed to both individuals and institutional investors and their share in the Polish investment fund market. SFIO funds operate on similar principles as open-end investment funds. However, SFIO funds in some respects differ from open-end funds, the main difference being that SFIO funds allow an indication in the charter o f formal conditions related to their participants or the conditions on which participants may request a repurchase of participation units. In the view or both these facts and characteristics of this part o f the Polish capital market, one may distinguish two kinds <b>o</b> f SFIO <b>funds</b> with two different groups o f participants: • funds associated with investment within the 3 'd pillar o f the Polish individual retirement system (table 1), • funds appropriative exclusively for legal persons (table 2).

Unsupervised grouping of samples (patients) is provided according to Gaussian mixture modelling of marker scores, with cardinality selected by Bayesian information criterion regularization. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is available, including comparison of groups identified by mixture modelling using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. TMA Navigator also supports network inference approaches useful for TMA datasets, which often constitute comparatively few markers. Tissue and cell-type specific networks derived from TMA expression data offer insights into the molecular logic underlying pathophenotypes, towards more effective and personalized medicine.

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} {{ribosomal proteins}} P 1 and P 2 bind to protein P 0 through their N-terminal domain {{to form the}} essential ribosomal stalk. A mutational analysis points to amino acids at positions 2 and 3 as determinants for the drastic difference of Saccharomyces cerevisiae P 1 and P 2 half-life, and suggest different degradation mechanisms for each protein type. Moreover, the capacity to form P 1 /P 2 heterodimers is drastically affected by mutations in the P 2 β four initial amino acids, while these mutations {{have no effect on}} P 1 β. Binding of P 2 β and, to a lesser extent, P 1 β to the ribosome is also seriously affected showing the high relevance of the amino acids in the first turn of the NTD α-helix 1 for the stalk assembly. The negative effect of some mutations on ribosome binding can be reversed by the presence of the second P 1 /P 2 couple in the ribosome, indicating a stabilizing structural influence between the two heterodimers. Unexpectedly, some mutations totally abolish heterodimer formation but allow significant ribosome binding and, therefore, a previous P 1 and P 2 association seems not to be an absolute requirement for stalk assembly. Homology modeling of the protein complexes suggests that the mutated residues can affect the overall protein conformation.

Design: Retrospective, observational study. Subject and Setting: The sample frame included dental clinical trials presented at the conferences of the International Association of Dental Research (IADR), European Orthodontic Society (EOS), European Organisation for Caries Research (ORCA), The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) and The Australian Society of Orthodontists (ASO) from January 2005 to December 2007. The sample frame for the University Teachers Group (UTG) abstracts, included abstracts presented at the UTG session of the British Orthodontic Conference (BOC) 1999 - 2010. Sample size Spencer found a publication rate of 38 % from abstracts of clinical trials presented at EOS, IADR, ORCA and a 50 % increase would be give a publication rate of 57 %. Using data from Spencer in Pocock’s formula, 210 abstracts {{would be required to}} give 80 % power, at the 5 % level, and enable me to detect a 50 % rise in the proportion of clinical trial abstracts published. Method: Clinical trials presented at above conferences were identified from the associated journals or conference proceedings. Inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability were assessed using a random 10 % sample of abstracts. A MEDLINE search was undertaken to determine whether the abstract had been published in full. The date of publication was recorded. Authors of abstracts that did not reach publication were contacted to determine the reasons. Results: Seven thousand and sixty-nine abstracts presented from 2005 - 2007 were identified, including 215 clinical trials. 142 abstracts were identified from the UTG session from 1998 – 2008, and all were included. The publication rate for the 2005 - 2007 sample was 32. 6 % and the UTG sample 34. 5 %. There were no predictors of publication in either group studied. The median time to publication of the 2005 – 2007 group was 16. 00 months, IQR (10, 26) and the mean time to publication for the UTG group was 18. 3 months (95 % CI 14. 38, 22. 19). For the unpublished 2005 - 2007 group, reasons given for failure to publish were lack of time (8. 3 %), language, culture, lack of teaching (1. 4 %), rejection (0. 7 %), motivation (0. 7 %), perceived editorial bias (0. 7 %) and length of review process (0. 7 %).

This system, an implementation of the Ikeda oscillator, is operating in a closed-loop configuration, exhibiting its autonomous dynamics while the drive signals are additionally introduced. Applying the same drive multiple times, we compare the dynamical responses of the optoelectronic oscillator and quantify the degree of consistency among them via their correlation. Our results show that consistency is not restricted to conditions close to the first Hopf bifurcation but {{can be found in}} a broad range of dynamical regimes, even in the presence of multistability.

40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) are multipotent, self-renewing {{progenitors}} that generate progeny that differentiate into neurons and glia. NSCs {{in the adult}} mammalian brain are generally quiescent. Environmental stimuli such as learning or exercise can activate quiescent NSCs, inducing them to proliferate and produce new neurons and glia. How are these behaviours coordinated? The neurovasculature, the circulatory system of the brain, is {{a key component of}} the NSC microenvironment, or ‘niche’. Instructive signals from the neurovasculature direct NSC quiescence, proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation. During ageing, a breakdown in the niche accompanies NSC dysfunction and cognitive decline. There is much interest in reversing these changes and enhancing NSC activity by targeting the neurovasculature therapeutically. Here we discuss principles of neurovasculature-NSC crosstalk, and the implications for the design of NSC-based therapies.
