The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Acts in the 1930s were direct contributors to World War II.

2500|$|After {{the near}} total {{collapse}} in 1998, the Russian economy recovered {{as a result}} of high oil prices during the presidency of Vladimir Putin, but remained heavily dependent on energy and raw material exports. In {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, global oil prices kept rising, fuelling economic growth. Medvedev later stated his belief that this was not only a boom, but also damaging to the Russian economy, saying that if the oil price is too high, [...] "we’d never change the structure <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>economy...</b> We haven’t done anything in the last 10 years because oil kept rushing higher and higher." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 20, John McCain {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Politico that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, owned; [...] "I think—I'll have my staff get to you," [...] he told the media outlet. Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, [...] "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain as somebody unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that [...] "the fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> are strong," [...] despite what he described as [...] "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street."

This common basis is becoming so important that it has engendered the need to add a new dimension to the original Smithian idea of the division of labour, i. e. we {{have to take into account}} the new forms of the digital division of labour.

2500|$|In {{campaign}} post-mortems, top McCain staffers {{conceded that}} the Palin rollout to the national media had not gone well. But they generally defended the decision to pick Palin, because the other [...] "game changing" [...] choice of Joe Lieberman would have been politically unacceptable to conservative Republicans at the convention and because there were not many good alternatives available. Regarding McCain having barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, McCain's pollsters {{said it was the}} right decision both on the merits and on the politics. McCain himself also defended both the Palin pick and the decision not to attack on the Wright controversy. The staffers agreed that McCain's remark that the [...] "fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> are strong" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} financial crisis had been a blunder, and said that the subsequent suspension of the campaign was an attempt to recover from the remark but had led to charges that McCain was erratic.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis worsened and precipitated a liquidity crisis; the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was quickly followed by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, sale of Merrill Lynch, and government bailout of American International Group. At first McCain emphasized that [...] "the fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> are strong", but when questioned on that statement he clarified that the fundamentals refer to the American workforce. He then recast his message into emphasizing that the country's economy was in [...] "a total crisis", condemning [...] "greed", and proposing that a national commission be set up to study the situation, akin to the 9/11 Commission. He later commented on the Federal Reserve loan of $85 billion to AIG by saying, [...] "I didn't want to do that...and I don't think anybody I know wanted to do that." [...] McCain then said that government regulators had been [...] "asleep at the switch" [...] and said if he were president he would fire U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox.|$|E

And here appears today a new and formidable threat: if the Indochina conflict is not resolved — and settled very fast — it is the risk of war, of international war and maybe atomic, that we must foresee. It is because I wanted a better peace that I wanted it earlier, when we had more assets. But even now there is some renouncings or abandons that the situation does not comprise.

2500|$|In March 2008, Alan Sugar made an {{announcement}} {{that he intended}} to propose to the BBC of creating a junior version of The Apprentice owing to its success, with the intention that it would feature children aged between 12-15 and be aired during an early evening timeslot. He later claimed that [...] "nobody took any notice" [...] of his suggestions. A year later, Sugar announced that he had begun negotiations with the BBC in regards to the concept he proposed - this included a focus on the winning team in episodes; a gentler handling of young candidates; the inclusion of his advisers in the spin-off; and airing on BBC One with a similar format structure to that of the main show, though with no use of the Interviews stage of the contest. Official confirmation that the idea had been green-lighted and production was underway on the spin-off, {{came in the form of}} announcement made during an episode of [...] covering the fifth series of the main show, on 20 May 2009, for applicants for the new show. Part of the announcement revealed that the initial concept for the age group of applicants had changed during negotiation, with it now being focused on those between 16–17 years old, from a variety of social and educational backgrounds, with the announcement inviting potential applicants to visit the official The Apprentice website to apply for the spin-off. Sugar remarked that the series, originally announced to be a five-part series, aimed to [...] "promote enterprise amongst young people, as the future <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> relies on them". In response to this announcement, 28,000 teenagers applied for the show, with ten selected to take part in the competition. After talks about its creation, the show's executive producers were chosen to be Jo Wallace for the BBC, Mark Burnett and C. Scot Cru for Mark Burnett Productions, and Sue Davidson and Michele Kurland for Talkback Thames.|$|E
