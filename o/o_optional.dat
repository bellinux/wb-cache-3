The two right columns include information from MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data: National Level Record [...] -Bibliographic: Full Level & Minimal Level. K y to the values in the columns: A — Mandatory if applicable. A data element that must be presentin a bibliographic record if it is appropriate for the item being described and if the bibliographic information is available. M — Mandatory. A data element that must be present in every bibliographic record. The fill character (|) is not permitted in mandatory data elements. <b>O</b> — <b>Optional.</b> An optional data element is not required in a bibliographic record, but may be present if desired. [] — Indicates fields and subfields that are now obsolete, but still appear in older records. The mark ". signifies that the data element does not form part of the minimal level record requirements group. Data elements marked with ".

The University of Bremen and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe will {{carry out the}} project jointly with support by the Universidad de los Andes in Mérida, Venezuela, for the tropical station. The University of Bremen {{is responsible for the}} maintenance and the operation of the high and mid-latitude stations. The high latitude station in Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen is equipped with three radiometers to measure ozone, water vapour and chlorine monoxide. At the mid-latitude station in Bremen, Germany, an ozone radiometer, also providing total columns of water vapour is operational since end of 2000 and presently in the validation phase. This latter instrument will be operated continuously during the time SCIAMACHY is in orbit. The Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe will install a well tested radiometer permitting to measure ozone, chlorine monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric acid (HNO 3), and tropospheric water vapour columns at the high altitude equatorial site in Mérida, Venezuela. The University of Bremen will contribute a second frontend to observe stratospheric water vapour...|$|R
40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This memo contains an algorithmic description of the rules used by an RSVP implementation for processing messages. It is intended to clarify the version 1 RSVP protocol specification. This memo provides a generic description of the rules for the operation of Version 1 of RSVP [RFC 2205]. It is intended to outline a set of algorithms that will accomplish the needed function, omitting many details. 1. GENERIC DATA STRUCTURES This memo assumes the generic interface calls defined in [RFC 2005] and the following data structures. An actual implementation may use additional or different data structures and interfaces. The data structure fields that are shown are required unless they are explicitly labelled as <b>optional.</b> <b>o</b> PSB [...] Path State Block Each PSB holds path state for a particular (session, sender) pair, defined by SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects, respectively, received in a PATH message...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the adaptation of the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) to the Rarotongan dialect of Cook Islands Maori, a Polynesian language spoken in the Cook Islands and expatriate communities. A brief linguistic sketch of Rarotongan is presented. As Rarotongan is characterised by a complex pronominal system, a versus <b>o</b> possession and <b>optional</b> topicalisation and focus constructions, particular issues arose in obtaining a rigorous adaptation of the BAT. Methods for ensuring effective adaptation across contrastive language pairs and sociocultural aspects of adapting the BAT to Rarotongan are discussed. Obtaining adaptations from several proficient bilingual consultants, comparing versions and group discussion to resolve discrepancies were used for this adaptation and are recommended. It is asserted that every individual {{has the right to}} receive accurate, detailed language assessment in each of their languages, irrespective of the languages spoken in the wider community. Further adaptations of the BAT will assist this to be achieved. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In this project, your task is {{to enable}} {{existing}} Yima Server PE v 1. 1 to communicate with an existing RTSP/RTP client software. Your implementation {{will be added to}} the Yima Personal Edition streaming media server code. You will be given the source code of Yima PE. NOTE: The description below may still be revised and updated {{a little bit in the}} near future. More specifically, your implementation with this framework consists of the following subtasks. 1) Implement RTSP Commands Your {{task is to}} revise the RTSP command-handling code in the Yima server such that it is compatible with the QuickTime Player (QTP). The Yima server understands basic RTSP commands, but they do not completely follow the latest standard. The individual steps for this task are as follows: o Launch the QTP and play a movie from the Darwin Streaming Server (DSS). DSS is installed on the Cervino server and RTSP communication between the client and the server is on the standard port 554. o Observe the RTSP communication between the client and the server with a packet sniffing program like WireShark or MS Network Monitor (see links below). o The minimal command set that needs to be implemented is DESCRIBE, SETUP, PLAY, and TEARDOWN. (Pause and resume are <b>optional.)</b> <b>o</b> The Yima server code related to RTSP processing is located in the Server/RTSP directory (i. e., the files rtsps_front. c and rtsps_back. c). 2) Create Media Blocks for Server Your second task is to produce media blocks that contain RTP packets such that the Yima server can load them and stream them to a client. The final goal is to create blocks that contain a fixed number of variable length RTP packets that are encoded according to the standard and recommendations of the RFC 3016 (RTP Payload Format for MPEG-...|$|R
