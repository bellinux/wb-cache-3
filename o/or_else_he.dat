5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|The two {{exchange}} wits; Jessica requests that Dain {{send her}} brother back to England {{in exchange for}} a valuable religious icon she will sell him, while Dain wants the icon <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> will destroy her reputation and ruin her brother. They reach an impasse, and while her reputation remains intact, Dain spends the week personally overseeing Bertie's disintegration from excessive drinking and gambling. Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave her reputation in tatters so casually.|$|E
5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems. More than a dozen people have killed {{themselves}} against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E

Clark sent Helm back with a demand of unconditional surrender within 30 minutes, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> would storm the fort. Helm returned before the time had expired and presented Hamilton's proposal for a three-day truce. This too was rejected, but Clark agreed to meet Hamilton at the village church.|$|E

25|$|A {{difficulty}} {{encountered in}} the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential {{in order to make a}} machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.|$|E

Attempting to reach out to Naoya, the Protagonist forgives him for the original murder and tries to convince him to repent.

The first police officer arrived approximately six minutes later. As the first few troopers approached the building, Roberts ordered them to leave <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> would start shooting.

Sundar resolved {{to kill himself}} by throwing himself upon a railroad track.

Sundar announced to his father, Sher Singh, that henceforth he would get converted into the missionary work of Christ.

People used to possess his house but his life was saved by the help of a nearby British funded Christian community.|$|E
25|$|The colours {{were then}} struck to Éveillé, upon which her {{commander}} demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering {{that if he}} was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent for him, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty rug, and did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it a disgrace, and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had it happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Anthony Lapalla, a {{psychologist}} at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, believed the killer was planning to continue to make unexpected attacks such as that of Virgil Starks on the outskirts of town. He also believed that the same person committed the murders of Virgil Starks, Betty Jo Booker, Paul Martin, Polly Ann Moore and Richard Griffin. He also believed the killer was between the ages of middle 30s to 50 years old. He said that the killer was apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and that he was a sadist. He said that a person who would commit such crimes is intelligent, clever, shrewd and often not apprehended. According to Lapalla's theories, the killer knew at all times what was being done in the investigation and knew that the lonesome roads were being patrolled, which is why he chose the house on the farmland. He pointed out that his statements were surmised theories that were based on {{a large number of people}} who have committed similar crimes. He said in many cases the killer is never apprehended and in some instances he will divert attention to other distant communities where it is believed the crimes are committed by a different individual <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> will overcome the desire to kill and assault women.|$|E
