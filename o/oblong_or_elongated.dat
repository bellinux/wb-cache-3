40|$|Computer-assisted, 3 -dimensional reconstructions of macular {{receptive}} {{fields and}} of their linkages into a neural network have revealed new information about macular functional organization. Both type I and type II hair cells {{are included in the}} receptive fields. The fields are rounded, <b>oblong,</b> <b>or</b> <b>elongated,</b> but gradations between categories are common. Cell polarizations are divergent. Morphologically, each calyx of oblong and elongated fields appears to be an information processing site. Intrinsic modulation of information processing is extensive and varies with the kind of field. Each reconstructed field differs in detail from every other, suggesting that an element of randomness is introduced developmentally and contributes to endorgan adaptability...|$|E
