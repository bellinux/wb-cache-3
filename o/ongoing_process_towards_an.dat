My study expands the work of Francis et al. (2014) to European acquirers and investigates if {{the same kind of}} home preference of shareholders and acquirers exists in Europe than in the U. S. Additionally, I examine how the <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> single M&A market has affected {{the choice of}} financial advisors in the European Union and how it differs from deals done elsewhere. I find that the same kind of home preference by shareholders and acquirers that exits in the U. S. does not exist in Europe. In fact, the choice of financial advisors does not explain abnormal returns at all, and the number of transactions advised by the Home and Expert advisors is almost the same. I also I find that firms are more likely to use home advisors if the target country is one of the 12 European countries that adopted the euro in the first stage. This indicates that the <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> single M&A market has reduced diffrences between corporate practices in the European Union. However, any strong conclusions cannot be made based on my study as my research suggests that the financial advisor classification to Home and Expert advisors {{may not be the best}} indicator to examine the choice of financial advisors at all. It is problematic to use two competing hypotheses because they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, my study suggests that a new method should be developed to explore the choice of financial advisors in cross-border M&As...|$|R
40|$|The urban {{agglomeration}} of the Vietnamese southeast industrial driving force Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) {{has become the}} most outstanding benefi ciary of the remarkable economic growth and foreign investments in the Vietnamese economy since the start of a comprehensive economic reform process in the mid 1980 s. The notable development towards the foremost economic centre led to a high influx of migrant workers. In the course of <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> expansion <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> megacity of tomorrow, the defi cient provision of adequate housing {{remains one of the most}} challenging problems of rural migrants in Greater HCMC. However, a future-oriented sustainable megacity concept is strongly dependent on the successful integration of migrants into the urban society. Within this context, the housing market is considered to be a key aspect of comprehensive urban planning. Hereby, housing microfinance (HMF) will be presented as an alternative housing finance scheme meeting the demand of a noteworthy number of poor and low-income people. Thereby HMF can do both: focus on specifi c needs of migrants with respect to their current life situation and enhance its outreach to a potential target group...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{changing}} {{role of the state}} in the Dutch healthcare system. At the eve of the first oil crisis the Netherlands had a relatively compound healthcare system combining several characteristics of the three Western healthcare system types: National Health Service, social health insurance system, and private health insurance system. Comparative case-studies on OECD countries indicate a hybridization trend from relatively pure to mixed healthcare systems during the era of ‘permanent austerity’. The adequate question is therefore, how and why {{the role of the state}} has changed in the relatively mixed Dutch social health insurance system. In order to approach this research question in a systematic way, we distinguish between three dimensions of the healthcare system: regulation, financing, and service provision. In the regulation dimension we observe an increasing state influence on coverage by an incremental socialization of the private sector. This progress culminated in 2006 in the merger of sickness funds and private health insurances into a functional social health insurance under private law. Since the early 1980 s the state also directly intervened in the corporatist bargaining of providers and insurers in order to contain costs and regain global competiveness. At the beginning of the new millennium tight budgets resulting in long waiting lists were no longer accepted against the background of a booming economy. Instead, the role of competition increased through new opportunities and incentives for selective contracting between insurers and providers. Therefore, we observe a shift from corporatist self-regulation towards state-regulated market competition within the institutional framework of a social health insurance system. This <b>ongoing</b> reform <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> welfare market for medical goods was supported by the main political parties on the left and right in order to enhance efficiency and safeguard solidarity...|$|R

40|$|For {{quite some}} time, the {{governance}} of municipal corporations has been criticized {{on the grounds of}} its lack of transparency and its weak mechanisms of accountability. However, despite the fact that municipal ownership of corporations has become an increasingly controversial issue, the number of municipal corporations has grown, as has also {{the extent to which they}} are perceived as a source of unfair competition with private corporations on open markets. This article poses critical questions concerning municipalities as corporate owners and addresses the prerequisites of accountability. Empirically grounded in an explorative case study, four policy-recommendations are generated for the municipal sector as a whole: 1) municipalities should continuously oversee the sector’s corporate structure; 2) <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> greater transparency and accessibility is desirable; 3) municipalities must establish a transparent process for appointing the boards of their corporations, and politicians joining them must be offered appropriate briefing and training; and lastly, 4) a critical awareness about the potential democratic dilemmas associated with the public ownership of corporations must be estab- lished among senior politicians. If these recommendations are neglected, there is a risk that the democratic legitimacy of the activities associated with municipal corporations will be eroded...|$|R
