40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{addresses the}} development of the legal regulation of entitlements to a disability pension from 1996 to 2012. The new regulation that entered into effect on 1 January 1996 as the Pension Insurance Act No. 155 / 1995 of the Collection of Laws of the Czech Republic (Coll.) introduced new definitions of full and partial disability. It cancelled partial disability pensions that required not only identification of a long-term adverse health condition but also a proof of a considerable drop in income; however, such concept of partial disability became unsustainable in a market economy with relatively free salary development. The long-term adverse health condition of insured persons began to be assessed in percentage according to Annex No. 2 to Regulation No. 284 / 1995 Coll., which often resulted in taking disability pensions away, but all citizens were considered equally. In 2003 there was a reform of administrative justice and the Administration Procedure Code entered into effect. Reviews of decisions on applications for disability pensions in the form of remedies were cancelled and decisions could be reviewed only based on a legal action. The institute of a cassation complaint as an extraordinary remedy was established at the same time. On 1 January 2010, new legal regulation of disability pensions was adopted through an amendment to Act No. 155 / 1995 Coll. The partial disability pension was completely cancelled and the full disability pension was dividend into three degrees. The amendment also introduced an <b>objections</b> <b>procedure</b> to serve as an ordinary remedy against decisions of the Czech Social Security Administration (ČSSZ). An action may be filed with a court only after an <b>objections</b> <b>procedure.</b> The thesis aims at ascertaining the impacts this legal regulation effective from 1 January 1996 and the subsequent amendment to this Act had on the number of remedies/actions filed by insured persons with courts in the course of time. A large increase in remedies was connected with passing this Act in 1996 and, by contrast, introduction of the <b>objections</b> <b>procedure</b> resulted in a rapid {{decline in the number of}} actions...|$|R

40|$|The process {{introduced}} by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to assess and allocate new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) offers a vehicle for content regulation at two levels. First, regarding the gTLD itself, <b>objection</b> <b>procedures</b> were set up to allow third parties to challenge an applied-for gTLD deemed to be contrary to “general principles of international law for morality and public order” or detrimental to broadly defined communities. The real target of these objections managed by the International Chamber of Commerce was not the gTLD itself, but the potentially controversial content that might be published under it. Second, these preventive measures were coupled with a strengthened anti-abuse policy for new gTLDs. ICANN amended its standard agreements with domain name registries and registrars to impose additional safeguards, compliance with “all applicable laws”, and remedies such as suspension of the domain name, which is a powerful tool to deny access to online content. Surprisingly these amendments were not discussed under ICANN’s consensus policy development process but added {{at the request of}} governments after the launch of the New gTLDs Program. These provisions, if actually enforced by ICANN, could lead to content policing by private entities without any measure to ensure due consideration of domain name holders’ freedom of expression. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This data is {{provided}} by five Dutch municipalities. The data contains all building permit applications {{over a period of}} approximately four years. There are many different activities present, denoted by both codes (attribute concept:name) and labels, both in Dutch (attribute taskNameNL) and in English (attribute taskNameEN). The cases in the log contain information on the main application as well as <b>objection</b> <b>procedures</b> in various stages. Furthermore, information is available about the resource that carried out the task and on the cost of the application (attribute SUMleges). The processes in the five municipalities should be identical, but may differ slightly. Especially when changes are made to procedures, rules or regulations the time at which these changes are pushed into the five municipalities may differ. Of course, over the four year period, the underlying processes have changed. The municipalities have a number of questions, namely: What are the roles of the people involved in the various stages of the process and how do these roles differ across municipalities? What are the possible points for improvement on the organizational structure for each of the municipalities? The employees of two of the five municipalities have physically moved into the same location recently. Did this lead to a change in the processes and if so, what is different? Some of the procedures will be outsourced from 2018, i. e. they will be removed from the process and the applicant needs to have these activities performed by an external party before submitting the application. What will be the effect of this on the organizational structures in the five municipalities? Where are differences in throughput times between the municipalities and how can these be explained? What are the differences in control flow between the municipalities? There are five different log files available in this collection. Events are labeled with both a code and a Dutch and English label. Each activity code consists of three parts: two digits, a variable number of characters, and then three digits. The first two digits as well as the characters indicate the subprocess the activity belongs to. For instance ‘ 01 _HOOFD_xxx’ indicates the main process and ‘ 01 _BB_xxx’ indicates the ‘objections and complaints’ (‘Beroep en Bezwaar’ in Dutch) subprocess. The last three digits hint on the order in which activities are executed, where the first digit often indicates a phase within a process. Each trace and each event, contain several data attributes {{that can be used for}} various checks and predictions. Furthermore, some employees may have performed tasks for different municipalities, i. e. if the employee number is the same, it is safe to assume the same person is being identified...|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been given to the development and operation of non-state models of global governance {{and the extent to which}} they conform to principles of good governance. Focusing primarily on issues of access to justice and secondarily on the independence of such bodies from the industries which they purport to regulate, this paper argues that adjudicative mechanisms established by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and firms may not produce outcomes which are considered 'just' by them. Part one locates dispute resolution as a narrower aspect of participation in decision-making, identifies several deficiencies of the state-centric model in the provision of justice and outlines collaborative NGO-corporate arrangements. Part two provides an account of one NGO-corporate arrangement, portrays its principal function and governance structure and identifies the relevant procedural aspects for initiating its private adjudicative arm. The case study considered in part three involves recourse by the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society to the <b>objections</b> <b>procedure</b> of the Marine Stewardship Council with a view to challenging the certification of the New Zealand hoki fishery as well-managed and sustainable. Finally, it is argued in part four that the lack of independence and limited remedies available to such arrangements does not merely fail to realise justice but has wider ramifications for the continued governance of corporate-NGO arrangements...|$|R

Many will cite moral grounds: the law is good, we {{have a duty to}} follow it. Others will simply appeal to {{negative}} consequences that follow from failing to heed its commands. Here, I want to sketch out a answer to the question in the tradition of legal positivism by using the machinery of ethical constructivism.

Without attempting to lay out a complete theory, I will advance the notion that we can settle on three conditions for the normativity of law. Adverting to formal games, I aim to show that we can start with the practical rationality of citizens whose interests and moral views deeply conflict, go through this procedure, and get reasons for the citizens to comply with laws that satisfy the conditions.

30|$|The next {{relevant}} {{question is}} what kinds of comments are given by the objectors {{and what kind of}} effects the objections have. No systematic research has been done into this issue in Germany, there is merely some evidence. The state government of Brandenburg answered a minor interpellation in 2002 : “Most of the <b>objections</b> in <b>procedures</b> conducted by the agencies for immission control and the state environment agency relate to concerns due to the immediate neighbourhood to the projects seeking permission. Very personal concerns {{play a major role in}} the objections, such as health issues, loss of value of real estate etc. The objections are as diverse as the planned projects and the local conditions. There are three issues that are of utmost relevance for all facilities listed in the 4 th Federal Immission Control Ordinance: noise, dust (ingredients of the dust) and odours”. 16 A study on the practice of environment impact assessment of 2001 did research into the effects of public participation, too. In his empirical analysis on 120 approval procedures, the author asked explicitly about the correlation between the number of objections and the extent of local and environment protection relevant modifications resp. the extent of general project modifications. He concludes that “the bigger the number of objections by the public and the § 29 (acknowledged environment) organisations, 17 the larger is the extent of spatial project modifications and environment protection relevant variants as well as technological modification of general kind (technological, spatial and renunciation of parts of the project) included in planning decisions” (Wende 2001 : 171). The author concedes, however, that even though this correlation is deducible, the modifications due to objections by the public “are of very little weight in the project modifications” (Wende 2001 : 171). Further relevant research on the influence of objections and comments on environment-relevant approval procedures is not on record in Germany.|$|R

Not to address their errant ways before {{attempting}} a cure could set them back in their [...] "errand". Many Puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art.

The apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the Sixth Commandment - [...] "thou shalt not kill" [...] — seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main <b>objections</b> against the <b>procedure.</b> Williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the Bible, it was not the will of God, and therefore [...] "unlawful." [...] He explained that inoculation violated The Golden Rule, because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease, he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him.

40|$|Implant {{treatment}} protocols for {{fully edentulous}} patients include implant-supported fixed restorations {{with a minimum}} of five to six implants or overdentures on two to four implants. However, implant placement in the posterior areas is sometimes not permitted by anatomic and/or financial restraints, or patients’ unwillingness to have extensive surgical procedures. The purpose of this case report is to present a treatment option where bilateral distal extension removable partial dentures (RPDs) are used in combination with anterior fixed implant prostheses with semi-precision attachments. The initial treatment plan of a 65 -year-old female with failing dentition involved the fabrication of overdentures supported by four implants placed in the interforaminal area in both arches. Because of inadequate space for the retentive elements of the overdenture and the patient’s <b>objection</b> to surgical <b>procedures</b> for the placement of additional implants to support a fixed restoration, the treatment plan was modified. Fixed ceramometal cement-retained implant restorations with semi-precision attachments adjacent to the distal abutments were fabricated in the maxilla and the mandible. Bilateral distal extension RPDs were placed in both arches. The patient’s benefits were increased comfort, good esthetics in the anterior area, improved phonetics, and masticatory function. Retentive element maintenance requirements were similar to conventional RPDs. More extended controlled clinical studies are needed to establish the long-term success of this treatment option.

60|$|Some {{examples}} of the substitution of construction for inference {{in the realm of}} mathematical philosophy may serve to elucidate the uses of this maxim. Take first the case of irrationals. In old days, irrationals were inferred as the supposed limits of series of rationals which had no rational limit; but the <b>objection</b> to this <b>procedure</b> was that it left the existence of irrationals merely optative, and for this reason the stricter methods of the present day no longer tolerate such a definition. We now define an irrational number as a certain class of ratios, thus constructing it logically by means of ratios, instead of arriving at it by a doubtful inference from them. Take again the case of cardinal numbers. Two equally numerous collections appear to have something in common: this something is supposed to be their cardinal number. But so long as the cardinal number is inferred from the collections, not constructed in terms of them, its existence must remain in doubt, unless in virtue of a metaphysical postulate ad hoc. By defining the cardinal number of a given collection as the class of all equally numerous collections, we avoid the necessity of this metaphysical postulate, and thereby remove a needless element of doubt from the philosophy of arithmetic. A similar method, as I have shown elsewhere, can be applied to classes themselves, which need not be supposed to have any metaphysical reality, but can be regarded as symbolically constructed fictions.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transplantation}} {{of fetal}} ventral mesencephalic (FVM) cell suspensions {{into the brain}} striatal system is an alternative approach {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease (PD). However, one <b>objection</b> to this <b>procedure</b> is the relatively poor survival of implanted cells. Attempts have been made to improve the survival of grafted dopaminergic neurons using glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Nevertheless, the clinical application of GDNF is limited, due to the difficulties in administering a protein to the brain tissue and due to the ubiquity of its receptor, thus leading to neurological side effects. A strategy to deliver GDNF in the brain based on the intracerebral implantation of biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) sustained release microspheres has been developed. Such microparticles can be easily implanted by sterotaxy in precise and functional areas of the brain without causing damage to the surrounding tissue. Moreover, the release profile of the GDNF-loaded microspheres showed a sustained release over 56 days of biologically active GDNF at clinically relevant doses. The present study shows that the implantation of GDNF-loaded microspheres at a distance to the site of FVM cells in the 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of PD improves dopaminergic graft survival and function. Furthermore, the unloaded and the GDNF-loaded microspheres, when they are mixed with FVM cells, may provide a mechanical support and a 3 D environment inducing differentiation and increased function of dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, these results show that GDNF microspheres represent an efficient delivery system for cell transplantation studies...|$|R

40|$|PCBs – {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} – rank amongst the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. Consumers mainly ingest these substances from milk, meat, eggs and fish. For {{the first time the}} European Commission has suggested maximum levels in food for non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs) that are intended to reduce consumer exposure to PCBs. BfR was asked to assess the EU proposal for a maximum level for PCBs from the angle of consumer health protection. BfR welcomes the fact that for the majority of PCBs, the ndl-PCBs, maximum levels are to be laid down across Europe. This would also lead to a replacement of the maximum levels for PCBs in the national contaminants ordinance which are deemed to be too high. According to the Institute, the maximum levels proposed still do not afford the population sufficient protection. Furthermore, some foods of animal origin with above-average levels of contamination, like wild game and fish liver are not taken into account in the EU provisions. The EU proposal envisages using the sum of 6 ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs), which account for around half of the PCB contamination in food, {{for the establishment of a}} maximum level. BfR has no <b>objections</b> to this <b>procedure</b> but is of the opinion that, with the maximum levels proposed by the EU, it is still the case that scarcely any foods with elevated PCB levels will be objected to. The reason: because of the correlation between dl-PCBs and ndl-PCBs in Germany, the proposed EU maximum levels would only then take effect after the already existing EU maximum levels for dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs (WHO-TEQs) had been exceeded. In the opinion of BfR, the WHO-TEQs already protect the population in Germany from elevated PCB exposure more effectively than the EU maximum levels proposed for Σ 6 PCBs could...|$|R
