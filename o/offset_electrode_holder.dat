40|$|Purpose: Contact lens {{electrodes}} (CLEs) {{are frequently}} used to register electroretinograms (ERGs) in small {{animals such as}} mice or rats. CLEs are expensive to buy or difficult to be produced individually. In addition, CLE`s have been noticed to elicit inconstant results and they carry potential to injure the cornea. Therefore, a new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was constructed based on the clinically used DTL-electrode and compared to CLEs. Material and methods: ERGs were recorded with both electrode types in nine healthy Brown-Norway rats under scotopic conditions. For low intensity responses a Naka-Rushton function was fitted and the parameters V(max), k and n were analyzed. The a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials were analyzed for brighter flash intensities (1 - 60 scot cd s/m(2)). Repeatability was assessed for both electrode types in consecutive measurements. Results: The new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was faster in setting up than the CLE and showed lower standard deviations. No corneal alterations were observed. Slightly higher amplitudes were recorded {{in most of the}} measurements with the new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> (except amplitudes induced by 60 cd s/m(2)). A Bland-Altman test showed good agreement between the DTL holder and the CLE (mean difference 35. 2 mu V (Holder-CLE)). Pearson`s correlation coefficient for test-retest-reliability was r = 0. 783. Conclusions: The DTL holder was superior in handling and caused far less corneal problems than the CLE and produced comparable or better electrophysiological results. The minimal production costs and the possibility of adapting the DTL holder to bigger eyes, such as for dogs or rabbits, offers with broader application prospects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This methodological paper {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of a novel ultralownoise pre- and main-amplifier system designed for the extracellular recording of voltage spikes produced by neuronal action potentials. The main difficulties with extracellular recording are the unwanted electrical signals that lower the recording quality. They include destructive interferences by alternating electric or magnetic fields, in addition to thermal and other random noises resulting from the intrinsic properties of the substances from which the electrode and the electrical circuit are made. The preamplifier is placed in a specially built metal headstage probe. It is designed so that microelectrodes can be plugged directly into the probe, keeping the electrode and preamplifier in the closest possible proximity. Unique <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> adaptors at the same time make the probe for the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> with the added benefit of extended electrical shielding. The main amplifier contains tuned circuit band pass filters optimized for metal and carbon fiber microelectrodes.

In test experiments, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and low-noise baseline recording were achieved. When carbon fiber microelectrodes were applied in the medulla of anesthetized rats, the total peak-to-peak noise level of the system was about 25 µV, i. e., about 6 µV RMS, which is only a few µV higher than the theoretical random noise.

40|$|Different {{zones and}} {{materials}} formed during {{the production of}} silicon in a silicon furnace has been examined in this thesis. Samples from two industrial scale silicon furnaces have been have been studied. The excavations were of Wacker furnace 4 and Wacker furnace 1. Wacker furnace 4 was excavated in August 2015 and samples retrieved are studied to gain a broader understanding of the zones observed by visual inspection of the furnace. Samples were collected from different zones in the furnace. Wacker furnace 1 was excavated in April 2016. Samples studied were retrieved from areas close to the electrode, {{from the top of}} it to the bottom. The main focus was to see how charge materials change along the electrode when moving down in the furnace. Fissured SiO 2 phase is found in samples collected from both Wacker furnace 4 and Wacker furnace 1. They are discussed to be unreacted quartz, condensate or quartz transformed to amorphous phase with some cristobalite. They are concluded to be condensate or transformed quartz, as they are found in high temperatures areas, were softened and melted quartz is assumed to be more smooth. In Wacker furnace 4, both green and brown condensate is found. It is discussed if the green and brown condensate origins from the same area, where some proba- bly has been moved due to the excavation method. Foamed slag is found near the loose charge and in the middle zone. SiC crust is found {{on the side of the}} elec- trode, and in the lower and upper part of the furnace. SiC crust is found in both electrode track zone and middle zone. A SiC/slag-mixture is found at the bottom of the furnace. The slag is mainly gehlenite and anorthrite. It has low viscosity. In Wacker furnace 1, unreacted charge was found in the pre-reaction area. Un- reacted charge was found down to 1. 2 m down in the furnace from the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> Half converted and fully converted coal to SiC was found 1. 5 m from the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> Condensate with Si in a SiO 2 -matrix was found 2 m from the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> Both condensate and SiC crust was found at the bottom of the electrode and in the electrode track zone between electrode 1 and 3. There is found more product of Si underneath the electrode than in the electrode track zone between electrode 1 and 3. This indicates a Si pool. The materials that make up the zones are different between furnace 4 and 1. This is due to operational history. The characterization of samples from both furnaces by LOM, EDS, BSD and EPMA are coherent with the first impression and guesstimated characterization of the samples by visual inspection during the excavation. LOM is a good way to get a preliminary impression of what the sample consists of and how a sample will look in the SEM and EPMA. SEM and EDS is good enough methods for qualitative characterization of phases in a Si furnace. The EDS analysis will be wrong, but consistent for phases of Si and SiC. The problem of carbon coating, making both Si and SiC contain carbon, is solved since the phases will be differed by the amount of carbon found. Slag samples are hard to analyze and to obtain good qualitative characterization with SEM and EDS. The slag analysis is better by the use of EPMA, but an ap- proximately characterization can be done with the SEM and EDS. To determine if SiO 2 phase found is from condensation or if it is transformed quartz, is hard to do by SEM and EPMA. XRD is proposed as a method for characterization...|$|R

Source localization was performed using Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) on a dictionary of overlapping multi-scale cortical patches constructed from 80, 130 dipoles in gray matter perpendicular to the cortical surface.

In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this assay format, recognition of biotin by streptavidin has been chosen as a model system. Labelling of biotin was achieved by covalent binding of a ferrocene derivative to the biotin unit. To reduce the consumption of expensive compounds and to allow automatisation of the assay a novel miniaturised set-up {{was developed}} based on a wall-free sample droplet which forms the electrochemical cell with typical volumes of up to 10 mul. This droplet is dispensed by means of a step-motor driven syringe pump through a specially designed <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> spanning the gap between a micro-working electrode and a macroscopic counter electrode. By means of a piezo-driven micro-dispenser a predefined number of nano-droplets (100 pl volume each) containing the redox-labelled hapten are shot into the sample droplet. By this, any physical contact and hence any cross-contamination between the sample and the reagent solution could be avoided. Signal amplification can be achieved by redox recycling between the micro-electrode and the perpendicular positioned macroscopic counter electrode. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
