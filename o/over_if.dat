5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed. Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming {{noted that the}} checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death, saving time. Official Xbox Magazine's Taylor Cocke, however, noted that the checkpoints save players' point progress, meaning that players would have to start the level <b>over</b> <b>if</b> their performance wasn't good enough before they reached the checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall <b>over</b> <b>if</b> it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|If the hastati {{failed to}} break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take <b>over.</b> <b>If</b> the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line {{were some of the}} least {{dependable}} troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.|$|E

5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game <b>over</b> <b>if</b> the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is <b>over</b> <b>if</b> Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up {{at the front of}} the legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the enemy. They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take <b>over.</b> <b>If</b> the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 hastati formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. Attached to each maniple were about 20 leves, javelin-armed light infantry. The hastati stood in the first battle line, {{in front of the}} principes of the second line and the triarii of the third. In a pitched battle, the leves would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with their javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take <b>over.</b> <b>If</b> the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii spearmen, who would then engage the enemy in turn.

25|$|The en echelon {{arrangement}} proved problematic.

Also, cross-deck firing damaged her deck and superstructure significantly due to the vacuum from passing shells. Because of this, and the potential for undue hull stress if the main guns were fired end-on, the en echelon arrangement was not used in U.S. Navy designs after Maine and Texas.|$|E

25|$|Burnet, {{aided by}} Close, was {{successful}} in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At {{the end of that}} season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take <b>over.</b> <b>If</b> Burnet resigned immediately, Vic Wilson could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.|$|E

25|$|About 70% of {{domestic}} cats are especially attracted to, and {{affected by the}} plant Nepeta cataria, otherwise known as catnip. Wild cats, including tigers, are also affected, but with unknown percentage. The first reaction of cats is to sniff. Then, they lick and sometimes chew the plant and after that rub against it, with their cheeks and the whole body by rolling <b>over.</b> <b>If</b> cats consume concentrated extract of the plant, they quickly show signs of over-excitement such as violent twitching, profuse salivation and sexual arousal. The reaction {{is caused by the}} volatile terpenoids called nepetalactones present in the plant. Although they are mildly toxic and repel insects from the plant, their concentration is too low to poison cats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} days of {{preparation}} for his ships to run past the forts, Farragut organized his fleet, dividing it into three sections. (This would not be at all exceptional in the Royal Navy, where the division of the fleet into the van, main fleet, and the rear was in fact the usual practice, but the United States Navy had not used full fleets before the Civil War.) Command of the first division of gunboats was given to Captain Theodorus Bailey, who was also appointed second in overall command, to take <b>over</b> <b>if</b> Farragut himself were to become incapacitated. Command of the second division of gunboats was given to Captain Henry H. Bell. Farragut retained divisional command of the ships for himself.|$|E
25|$|Overlapping sub-problems {{means that}} the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any {{recursive}} algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: F'i = F'i1 + F'i2, with base case F1=F2=1. Then F43 =F42+F41, and F42 =F41+F40. Now F41 is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F43 as well as F42. Even though {{the total number of}} sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and <b>over</b> <b>if</b> we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.|$|E
