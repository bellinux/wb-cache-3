5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Ernst Haeckel {{described}} (Haeckel, 1904) {{a number of}} species of Radiolaria, some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include Circoporus octahedrus, Circogonia icosahedra, Lithocubus geometricus and Circorrhegma dodecahedra. The shapes of these creatures should be <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> their names.|$|E
25|$|As is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> their origins, {{the above}} cancer chemotherapies are {{essentially}} poisons. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side-effects that limited the doses {{which could be}} administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized {{that the ability to}} manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} {{regard it}} as <b>obvious,</b> <b>from</b> their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe, that of Joseph. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} {{numerical}} analysis predates {{the invention of}} modern computers by many centuries. Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the names of important algorithms like Newton's method, Lagrange interpolation polynomial, Gaussian elimination, or Euler's method.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{right whale}} skeleton was discovered on the seamount in 2005. The skeleton had been mostly stripped of flesh {{when it was}} found, indicating that it had probably spent many years on the ocean bottom. Although it was not <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> surrounding fauna, whale falls like this may be boons for organisms living in ordinarily resource-poor regions.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{analytical}} index is usually hard to evaluate directly, {{it is at}} least obviously an integer. The topological index is by definition a rational number, but it is usually not at all <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{have seen}} an <b>obvious</b> {{influence}} <b>from</b> Shakespeare's Othello in Ford's play. D'Avolos is a version of Iago; Bianca champions {{the cause of a}} courtier named Roselli, as Desdemona champions Cassio.|$|R
25|$|A lasting {{consequence}} of Burr's {{role in the}} election of 1800 was the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed {{the way in which}} vice presidents were chosen. As was <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the 1800 election, the situation could easily arise where the vice president, as the defeated presidential candidate, could not work well with the president. The Twelfth Amendment required that votes be cast separately for president and vice president.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} regimen is 2HRE/7HR, {{for which}} there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only isoniazid and rifampicin is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received ethambutol for the first two to three months (although this is not <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.|$|E
25|$|In January 1864, a Senate {{committee}} {{chaired by}} John Parker Hale formed to investigate naval contract fraud. The Navy brass despised Hale since he helped convince Congress to ban flogging in 1850 and grog rations in 1862. Hearings lasted almost four months, with the Smith brothers providing key testimony. The committee’s report was not released until June 29, {{but it was}} <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> testimony that it would confirm Smith's accusations and dismiss the Navy's allegations against the Smith brothers.|$|E

50|$|Another {{variant of}} reality {{pornography}} consists of normal couples that are filmed by professionals, {{in which case}} the only <b>obvious</b> distinction <b>from</b> amateur pornography is the higher quality of production, filming and editing.|$|R
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention. It was <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the spinor Lie {{derivative}} is independent of the metric, and hence also of the connection. This is not <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the spinor bundle. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.|$|E
25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces {{promote to}} a piece {{that exists in the}} initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further promote to a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. Then the {{fundamental}} theorem on {{upper and lower}} solutions for problem (P) is given as follows. The proof {{can be done by}} <b>obvious</b> combination <b>from</b> Lee [20], Lee and Lee [21] and Lü and O’Regan [22].|$|R
50|$|His {{work during}} his period is {{colorful}} and vibrant, with <b>obvious</b> influences <b>from</b> aboriginal culture. The most important Australian work is Pandemonium, a fabric frieze made in 1930, {{and in the}} collection of the National Gallery of Australia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>obvious</b> {{corollary}} <b>from</b> this theorem is {{that the}} “best” among regular estimators are those with the second component identically equal to zero. Such estimators are called efficient and are known to always exist for regular parametric models.|$|R
25|$|It {{is quite}} <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> {{a review of}} Schreiner's conduct through {{the latter half of}} 1899 that he was entirely mistaken in his view of the Transvaal situation. He {{demonstrated}} the same inability to understand the uitlanders' grievances, the same futile belief in the eventual fairness of President Kruger as premier of Cape Colony as he had shown when giving evidence before the British South Africa Select Committee into the causes of the Jameson Raid. Experience should have taught him that President Kruger was beyond any appeal to reason, and that the protestations of President Steyn were insincere.|$|E
25|$|Mohenjo-daro had no {{series of}} city walls, but was {{fortified}} with guard towers {{to the west}} of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Ponce died on 27 July, {{according}} to the tablas de aniversarios (a calendar of annual commemorations) of the nunnery of Carrizo. That the year was 1175 is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> his sudden disappearance from contemporary documentation after June of that year. He was buried in Sandoval. In {{the archives of the}} monastery of Benevívere are two charters both dated 30 July, only a few days after Count Ponce's death, which record the donation received from his widow and children of lands at Quintanilla and Mayorga (in the first transaction) and lands at Santamarina and Lerones with the Hospital de Don García (in the second transaction) for the redemption of Ponce's soul.|$|E
