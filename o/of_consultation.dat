5|$|However, Bruce {{soon became}} embroiled in the {{disputes}} over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and his lack <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly {{left out of}} cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E

5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> with {{county council}} members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators. Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two new vehicles were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E

5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack <b>of</b> <b>consultation,</b> and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E

5|$|When the Cuban Missile Crisis {{erupted in}} October 1962, Kennedy {{chose not to}} consult with Diefenbaker before making {{decisions}} on what actions to take. The US President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as {{to the content of}} the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> {{and the fact that he}} was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support. In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective. To {{study the}} {{associations}} between active choice {{of primary care}} provider and healthcare utilization, multimorbidity, age, and sex, comparing data from primary care and all healthcare in a Swedish population. Design. Descriptive cross-sectional study using descriptive analyses including t-test, correlations, and logistic regression modelling in four separate models. Setting and subjects. The population (151 731) and all healthcare in Blekinge in 2007. Main outcome measure. Actively or passively listed in primary care, registered on 31 December 2007. Results. Number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> (OR 1. 31, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 1. 32), multimorbidity level (OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 67 - 1. 70), age (OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 03), and sex (OR for men 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 68) were all associated with registered active listing in primary care. Active listing was more strongly associated with number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> and multimorbidity level using primary care data (OR 2. 11, 95 % CI 2. 08 - 2. 15 and OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 2. 11 - 2. 17, respectively) than using data from all healthcare. Number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> and multimorbidity level were correlated and had similar associations with active listing in primary care. Modelling number <b>of</b> <b>consultations,</b> multimorbidity level, age, and sex gave four separate models with about 70 % explanatory power for active listing in primary care. Combining number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> and multimorbidity did not improve the models. Conclusions. Number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> and multimorbidity level were associated with active listing in primary care. These factors were also associated with each other differently in primary care than in all healthcare. More complex models including non-health-related individual characteristics and healthcare-related factors are needed to increase explanatory power...|$|R

We aimed to retrieve data on consultations from general practice databases {{and to develop}} and use appropriate methods of validation for these data. Method. MIQUEST software was used to retrieve the data from four practices. The data were validated by comparing them with figures generated by practice-based searches, measuring the uptake <b>of</b> recording <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> over time, and comparing records <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> in the case notes with those on the practice computers. Results. The required data were retrieved from general practice databases, but the path to success was difficult, and typified by uncertainty and unpredictability. The recording <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> on the computers of four practices was more complete than the record-ing in the paper case records.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many {{studies have}} shown the adverse effects of air {{pollution}} on respiratory health, but few have {{examined the effects of}} air pollution on service utilisation in the primary care setting. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association between air pollution and the daily number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> due to upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in general outpatient clinics (GOPCs) in Hong Kong. METHODS: Daily data on the numbers <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> due to URTIs in GOPCs, the concentrations of major air pollutants, and the mean values of metrological variables were retrospectively collected over a 3 -year period (2008 - 2010, inclusive). Generalised additive models were constructed to examine the association between air pollution and the daily number <b>of</b> <b>consultations,</b> and to derive the relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) <b>of</b> GOPC <b>consultations</b> for a unit increase in the concentrations of air pollutants. RESULTS: The mean daily consultations due to URTIs in GOPCs ranged from 68. 4 to 253. 0 over the study period. The summary relative risks (and 95 % CI) <b>of</b> daily <b>consultations</b> in all GOPCs for the air pollutants PM 10, NO 2, O 3, and SO 2 were 1. 005 (1. 002, 1. 009), 1. 010 (1. 006, 1. 013), 1. 009 (1. 006, 1. 012), and 1. 004 (1. 000, 1. 008) respectively, per 10 µg/m(3) increase in the concentration of each pollutant.
