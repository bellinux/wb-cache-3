The membraneless cell output, contains sodium ions which increases the pH, therefore it affects the composition of the output products. To keep the pH in the neutral range, the required amount of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid must be added to the disinfected water. It should be noted that in this kind of cells, the main product is sodium hypochlorite. <b>One</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> in cells with membrane, the anode output (anolyte) is acidic and the cathode output (catholyte) is basic.
