5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
25|$|The verse of Waking in December, Thakore's {{first book}} shows a reverence for {{definite}} form and {{an interest in}} classical structures like the sonnet and the villanelle, exemplified in poems like Chandri Villa <b>or</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> can Get away with. This interest in classical forms is linked to his training as a Hindustani classical vocalist and composer.|$|E
25|$|Coleman's critics, mostly DFL party leaders, {{speculated that}} his switch was {{motivated}} by his known aspirations for statewide office. As an abortion opponent and a frequent adversary of public employee unions, Coleman's positions put him {{at odds with the}} DFL Party leadership in Minnesota. In a letter to supporters announcing the switch, Coleman wrote that “while the political party I belong to changes, nothing about how I govern <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe changes at all.” He was re-elected as St. Paul Mayor in 1997, with nearly 60% of the vote.|$|E

500|$|Crew members often {{complained about}} {{difficult}} shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer. Iñárritu stated {{that some of}} the crew members had left the film, explaining that [...] "as a director, if I identify a violin that is out of tune, I have to take that from the orchestra." [...] On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: [...] "I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do. Whether it’s {{going in and out of}} frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> ate on set. [...] enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the film's {{success with}} Western audiences, Miike {{states that he}} was not surprised, but that he had [...] "no idea {{what goes on in the}} minds of people in the West and I don't pretend to know what their tastes are. And I don't want to start {{thinking}} about that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start deliberately worrying about why <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do to make it happen again". Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> imagine people are going through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and megalomania, while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{is known}} for keeping a low profile and very private lifestyle, saying: [...] "The music is what sells. Not me, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> stand for... that's the way I've always wanted it". She is not married and is a {{surrogate}} aunt to the Ryans' two daughters. In 1991, she said: [...] "I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think {{a great deal about}} this". Her relationship with a Spanish man ended in 1997, around the time when she considered taking time out of music to have a family, but found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and [...] "gone the route I wanted to go". [...] She declares herself as [...] "more spiritual than religious... I derive from religion what I enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus {{describes}} himself as [...] "pretty straight" [...] until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock. He lived in Fairfax, Virginia (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) during his early high school years and attended Annandale High School during his second year, at which time he received his first bass guitar and attended his first concert: They Might Be Giants at the [...] shortly before his sixteenth birthday, March 4, 1988. [...] "I didn't know where I should stand <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do, so my friends and I bought some menthol cigarettes and smoked {{for the first time}} and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots," [...] Hoppus remembered. Hoppus received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale. He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. Hoppus has remarked that [...] "Silly Girl" [...] by the Descendents was the [...] "song that made me fall in love with punk rock music [...] that song changed my life forever." [...] Likewise, Hoppus borrowed a cassette version of The Cure's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school and was taken with [...] "Just Like Heaven".|$|E
