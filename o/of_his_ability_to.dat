5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{provide stable}} rule, Diệm forced {{the matter to}} a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence {{and control of the}} police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E
50|$|In {{the musical}} Man of La Mancha, Don Quixote and his {{assistant}} Sancho Panza encounter a barber surgeon, who boasts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> give a good shave and bandage up any mishaps his straight razor might inflict.|$|R
5000|$|... The {{president}} of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, said that Blake Mora {{was not only}} an exceptional public servant, but also was an [...] "exceptional Mexican." [...] They gave a speech and said that Mexico had lost a [...] "great patriot and a good friend," [...] and promised to work <b>to</b> the best <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> bring {{the causes of the}} accident and bring transparency.|$|R
5000|$|The mock-trial's prosecutor, a cynic called [...] "The Duke", {{is chosen}} by Cervantes to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fiancé, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the {{prisoner}} who is playing him. Carrasco is {{upset at the}} idea of having a madman in his prospective new family but the padre cleverly convinces him that it would be a challenge worthy <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> cure <b>his</b> prospective uncle-in-law, so he and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home ("I'm Only Thinking of Him Reprise").|$|R
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> criticize the president or call {{the vice president and}} Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put {{too much emphasis on}} his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape them because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, {{which the government}} wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.|$|E
5000|$|Kiyoshi Ijichi (Ijichi Kiyoshi) (born September 25, 1977) is {{the drummer}} of the Japanese rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation. Ijichi credits the origin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{drumming}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> playing in marching bands in junior high.|$|R
2500|$|The adult Snape, on {{the other}} hand, is portrayed as very self-assured and {{confident}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities,</b> <b>to</b> a degree that Rickman described as [...] "full of himself." [...] Director David Yates said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power. Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely {{at a loss for}} words or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused <b>of</b> cowardice. <b>His</b> otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.|$|R
2500|$|The Doctor {{exhibits}} some weaknesses {{uncommon to}} humans. For example, according to The Mind of Evil (1971), a tablet of aspirin could kill him. In [...] "Cold Blood", a process meant to decontaminate him of bacteria {{from the surface}} of Earth causes him intense pain, and he says it could have killed him if allowed to proceed to completion. In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Adventuress of Henrietta Street, the Doctor's second heart was surgically removed, resulting in the loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> metabolise drugs and go without air; these are restored when he begins to grow a new heart after his old one 'dies' (Camera Obscura).|$|R
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 3. He {{moves into the}} Iwatodai dorm, {{learning}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when the dorm is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in {{that he has the}} Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new and more powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{was born}} in Royston, near Barnsley, on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real {{background}} in cricket. He was sent to St Peter's, York, where he made a good impression as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years. In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs {{at an average of}} 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the bowling averages, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket. His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord's Cricket Ground, in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team-mate Denis Compton. In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform well on important occasions. While still at school, he {{came to the attention of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club, playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst. He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934.|$|E

While Daisy tries to contain the tremors, Coulson confronts Morrow and reveals the true nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> him, distracting him while May, Mack, Elena, and Mace get into position. The agents attack Morrow and his men, and Robbie traps Morrow with him in the demon core as Fitz, Simmons, Radcliffe, and AIDA send it to Hell.|$|R

25|$|Mussina's {{prolonged}} {{success was}} also the result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make adjustments.

50|$|Parseltongue is the {{language}} of snakes. It is often associated with Dark Magic, although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality. Those possessing the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> speak it ("Parselmouths") occur very rarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method of xenoglossia, such as through genetic inheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry was a Parselmouth until the age of 18. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets explains this was because of Voldemort's passing on some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> Harry the night he tried to kill him. Deathly Hallows reveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability, which is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability.|$|R
25|$|S. T. Karnick, National Review (May 10, 2002) — Timothy Hutton, {{who also}} serves as {{executive}} producer for the show, is just brilliant as Archie Goodwin, managing to express the gumshoe's toughness (which I had been rather skeptical <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> do) as effectively as he shows his moral strength and emotional complexity. … Chaykin quite simply is Nero Wolfe, playing the role with impressive confidence and subtlety.|$|E
