25|$|The {{state-owned}} {{shipping company}} Arctia Shipping Oy and its predecessors have been heavily criticized {{over the years}} for the financial losses from the <b>offshore</b> <b>business.</b> Due to design compromises the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are unable to compete with purpose-built platform supply vessels — the open-water performance of the spoon-shaped bow is very poor due to slamming. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent {{long periods of time}} in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the ports open. However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration, the <b>offshore</b> <b>business,</b> while not profitable, has covered {{at least some of the}} expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.|$|E
