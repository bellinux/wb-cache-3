40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a systematic analysis}} {{of the effect of}} common acid sulfate soil (ASS) sample pre-treatments (namely freezing, <b>oven</b> <b>drying,</b> and grinding) on chromium-reducible sulfur (SCR) and water-soluble sulfate determinations. The results show that <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> and hand grinding of the samples prior to analysis resulted in a decrease in SCR (i. e. up to 20 % compared to those of frozen samples). This lower SCR value was partly due to the oxidation of sulfides in the oven. For oven-dried ASS materials, more intensive grinding in a ring mill increased SCR values, most likely by abrading coatings from pyrite grains. For oven-dried mineral ASS materials the highest SCR values were obtained with 1 min of ring mill grinding, but for soils with appreciable organic matter (such as peat), 5 min of ring mill grinding gave the highest values. The results indicate that for some ASS materials, <b>oven</b> <b>drying,</b> regardless of the ensuing grinding procedure, results in underestimated SCR values.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of nine physical treatment types comprising a serial combination of three drying (air, freeze and oven) and two comminution (milling and sieving) methods on the quantification of PAH in a soil sample from a former gasworks. Results show that treatment type has {{a significant effect on}} PAH concentration (p⩽ 0. 05). Naphthalene, 1 -methylnaphthalene and 2 -methylnaphthalene concentrations were significantly higher for air drying and freeze drying treatments than for <b>oven</b> <b>drying.</b> It is suggested that naphthalene and similarly volatile PAH losses were greater for <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> due to the application of fanned warm air which is thought to cause volatilisation. Analytical precision was significantly improved for milled samples compared with sieved samples. The reason milling results in greater precision is assigned to the improved solvent extraction efficiency when natural grain size is altered due to crushing. The analytical data were compared to residential generic assessment criteria (GAC) used for risk-based land management. It was shown that the naphthalene GAC was lower than all freeze drying and air drying concentrations but was within the <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> concentration range, illustrating that a false negative could be concluded during risk evaluation is oven dried data were used. Overall, it is recommended that air drying or freeze drying is a better choice than <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> if the quantification of low molecular weight PAH forms an important objective of sample characterisation for risk-based land management, otherwise freeze drying and milling is recommended...|$|E

Individual phenolic acids and flavonoids, 6 - and 8 -gingerol and shogaol were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays {{were used for the}} evaluation of antioxidant activities. The highest reduction in moisture content was observed after freeze drying (82. 97 %), followed by vacuum <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> (80. 43 %) and shade drying (72. 65 %).

The highest content of 6 - and 8 -gingerol was observed after freeze drying, followed by vacuum <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> and shade drying methods. Fresh samples had the highest PPO activity and lowest content of flavonoid and phenolic acid compounds compared to dried samples.
