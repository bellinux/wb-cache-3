40|$|Quantitative bulk {{analysis}} of fluid inclusion volatiles measures {{the composition of}} trapped geothermal liquids and vapor. Fluid-inclusion gas-analyses may identify fluid boiling and mixing, and the analyses {{can be used as}} a fluid tracer. Fluid boiling is indicated by excess gaseous species. Linear arrays of data points on gas ratio diagrams indicate fluid mixing. Nitrogen-argon ratios are used to discriminate atmospheric fiom magmatic volatiles. Crustal components in geothermal fluids are best indicated by concentrations of methane and helium. Methane strongly correlates with <b>other</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and <b>N</b> 2 -Ar-CH 4 plots are similar to N 2 -Ar-He diagrams. Alkene to alkane ratios of C 2 - 7 organic species indicate the oxidation state of geothermal fluids. The Geysers inclusion analyses are an example of how inclusion fluids may be used to understand the paleo hydrology of a geothermal system...|$|R
40|$|Dairy cattle {{housing is}} a signiﬁcant source of NH 3 and GHG {{emissions}} to atmosphere. However, the climate, temperature in particular, and {{the characteristics of}} the excreta of the housed cattle, may have a strong inﬂuence on the magnitude of such emissions. The objectives were to assess the effects of temperature and excreta characteristics of heifers, dry cows and lactating cows on potential NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. The experiment was conducted using laboratory chambers where constant amounts of urine and faeces were applied to a concrete ﬂoor. Potential NH 3 and GHG emissions were measured over 120 -h following application at 5, 15, 25 and 35 C. Increasing temperature promoted a signiﬁcant increase in NH 3 emissions. At temperatures 15 C, total NH 3 emissions accounted for more than 100 % of the ureaeN content of the urine for the three dairy cattle types, indicating that <b>other</b> <b>organic</b> <b>N</b> <b>compounds</b> of urine and faeces are an important source of NH 3. The cumulative amount of N 2 O released did not vary signiﬁcantly with temperature and ranged from 1 to 2 % of total N deposited. Cumulative CO 2 emissions were ca. 14 e 58 % of total C deposited and the cumulative CH 4 emissions were signiﬁcantly higher at 25 C than at all other temperatures. It was concluded that increasing temperature from 5 to 35 C signiﬁcantly increased potential NH 3, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions but did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence N 2 O emissions. Also, the diet supplied to lactating cows led to signiﬁcantly higher NH 3, N 2 O and CO 2 emissions relative to heifers and dry cow...|$|R
