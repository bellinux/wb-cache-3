5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> create music and by changing one of the rhythms, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> create different music. This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.|$|E

5|$|During {{a speech}} made by US President Barack Obama held at Georgia Tech in the McCamish Pavilion on March 10, 2015, the {{president}} jokingly {{indicated that he}} was supposed to be introduced by George P. Burdell, but no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> find George.|$|E
30|$|Researchers {{recognized}} {{early on}} that not all problems can be solved this quickly, {{and they had a}} hard time figuring out exactly which <b>ones</b> <b>could</b> and which <b>ones</b> <b>could</b> not. There are several so-called NP-hard problems, which cannot be solved in polynomial time, even though nobody can prove a super-polynomial lower bound.|$|R

5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, but no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> quite conceive how a small fighter {{could have the}} range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.|$|E

5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain that no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming {{the use of the}} clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E

5|$|Although the Solicitor General was {{the lowest}} legal appointment, a {{successful}} <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be appointed Attorney General, and by custom, the Attorney General was allowed to become Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench if a vacancy arose. Although many barristers were not good politicians, Murray became a successful Member of Parliament, and one noted for his oratorical skills and logical arguments.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} {{series of}} foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating {{it to its}} patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king {{as part of his}} religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the corvée system. The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing <b>one,</b> <b>could</b> last years or decades.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E

5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Library {{became a}} popular {{destination}} for studying and hanging out {{for young people}} from well-known neighbouring schools such as Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls' School, St Joseph's Institution and Tao Nan School that had their early beginnings in this area. The landmark Balustrade or front porch and steps {{leading up to the}} Library became an intimate public space where <b>one</b> <b>could</b> sit and read, wait, chat or simply watch the world go by.|$|E

5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of other cultures and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs. She believed that the tracks should stand on their own, so that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> sing them accompanied with just a guitar. Madonna {{enlisted the help of}} her daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, calling them her A advisers. They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If <b>one</b> <b>could</b> see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E

5|$|Luther {{was summoned}} by {{authority}} of the pope to defend himself against charges of heresy before Thomas Cajetan at Augsburg in October 1518. Cajetan did not allow Luther to argue with him over his alleged heresies, but he did identify two points of controversy. The first was against the fifty-eighth thesis, which stated that the pope could not use the treasury of merit to forgive temporal punishment of sin. This contradicted the papal bull Unigenitus promulgated by Clement VI in 1343. The second point was whether <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be assured {{that they had been}} forgiven when their sin had been absolved by a priest. Luther's Explanations on thesis seven asserted that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> based on God's promise, but Cajetan argued that the humble Christian should never presume to be certain of their standing before God. Luther refused to recant and requested that the case be reviewed by university theologians. This request was denied, so Luther appealed to the pope before leaving Augsburg. Luther was finally excommunicated in 1521 after he burned the papal bull threatening him to recant or face excommunication.|$|E
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. <b>One</b> <b>could</b> say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught <b>one</b> <b>could</b> hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E
