They are constructing a main football stadium with a capacity of 16,000 spectators and an area of 71,150 m². The project also includes two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a fustal pitch, a handball court, a hotel, restaurants, and a covered swimming pool. Al-Talaba is defined as a sports club, not just a football one, and it has supported other sports at minor level <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The foundation stone was laid by the former minister of higher education and scientific research, Ali al-Adeeb, in February 2014. The cost of the project is estimated to be $84 million and the duration of construction was expected to be 30 months, meaning that by 2017 the Al-Talaba Sports City should be open. Due to the financial crisis in Iraq, the project was scratched after spending $4 million on designs.|$|E

More liberal Conservative congregations omit references to the Temple sacrifices entirely. Reconstructionist and Reform congregations generally do not do the Mussaf Amidah at all, but if they do, they omit all references to Temple worship.|$|E
25|$|The Bontoc live on {{the banks}} of the Chico River in the Central Mountain Province on the island of Luzon. They speak Bontoc and Ilocano. They {{formerly}} practiced head-hunting and had distinctive body tattoos. The Bontoc describe three types of tattoos: The chak-lag′, the tattooed chest of the head taker; pong′-o, the tattooed arms of men and women; and fa′-tĕk, for all other tattoos of both sexes. Women were tattooed on the arms <b>only.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> the Bontoc engaged in none of the usual pastimes or games of chance practiced in other areas of the country, but did perform a circular rhythmic dance acting out certain aspects of the hunt, always accompanied by the gang′-sa or bronze gong. There was no singing or talking during the dance drama, but the women took part, usually outside the circumference. It was a serious but pleasurable event for all concerned, including the children. Present-day Bontocs are a peaceful agricultural people who have, by choice, retained most of their traditional culture despite frequent contacts with other groups.|$|E

2500|$|The {{emphasis}} on concreteness and reality would remain {{a feature of}} {{his career as a}} prelate. [...] Creighton saw the Church of England not as an abstract entity existing independently in space and time, but as rooted in England, its people, and their history. [...] In the words of Kenneth Robbins, [...] "It was an unashamed acknowledgment on (Creighton's) part that the form, structure, ethos and doctrine of that church had been fashioned in the circumstances of English history." [...] Similarly, Creighton saw the living church as an embodiment of the present-day yearnings of the English people. [...] "(The) general trend of the Church", he wrote, [...] "must be regulated by (the English people's) wishes. [...] The Church cannot go too far from them." [...] Consequently, Creighton could imbue the church with Victorian self-assessments and aspirations. [...] "The function of the Church of England", he was comfortable saying, [...] "was to be a church of free men. [...] The Church of Rome was the church of decadent peoples: it lives <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and has no future ... The Church of England has before it the conquest of the world." [...] As a natural corollary of this outlook, Creighton was explicitly against {{the separation of church and}} state. [...] In his way of thinking, church and state were two aspects of the nation as seen from two vantage points. [...] Any attempt at legislating a separation would, in addition, have caused social disruptions in late-Victorian Britain: many higher clergy had ties of education and friendship with prominent public men.|$|E

It must have been in vacation, for I met no one as I wandered through the college yard, trying to make up my mind as to how I should learn where Lowell lived; for it was he whom I had come to find. He had not only taken the poems I sent him, but he had printed two of them in a single number of the Atlantic, and had even written me a little note about them, which I wore next my heart in my breast pocket till I almost wore it out; and so I thought I might fitly report myself to him. But I have always been helpless in finding my way, and I was still depressed by my failure to convince the horse-car driver that he had taken the wrong road. I let several people go by without questioning them, and those I did ask abashed me farther by not knowing what I wanted to know. When I had remitted my search for the moment, an ancient man, with an open mouth and an inquiring eye, whom I never afterwards made out in Cambridge, addressed me with a hospitable offer to show me the Washington Elm. I thought this would give me time to embolden myself for the meeting with the editor of the Atlantic if I should ever find him, and I went with that kind old man, who when he had shown me the tree, and the spot where Washington stood when he took command of the Continental forces, said that he had a branch of it, and that if I would come to his house with him he would give me a piece. In the end, I meant merely to flatter him into telling me where I could find Lowell, but I dissembled my purpose and pretended a passion for a piece of the historic elm, and the old man led me not only to his house but his wood-house, where he sawed me off a block so generous that I could not get it into my pocket. I feigned the gratitude which I could see that he expected, and then I took courage to put my question to him. Perhaps that patriarch lived <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and cared for history and not literature. He confessed that he could not tell me where to find Lowell; but he did not forsake me; he set forth with me upon the street again, and let no man pass without asking him. In the end we met one who was able to say where Mr. Lowell was, and I found him at last in a little study at the rear of a pleasant, old-fashioned house near the Delta.|$|E
