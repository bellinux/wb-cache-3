Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries,</b> with significant differences between high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study.

For example, due to public health interventions and progress in medical care, there has been a remarkable improvement in life expectancy {{over the past couple of}} decades. Life expectancy in 2012 was 84 years for women and 78 years for men, which has ranked Finland favorably against global comparisons. Impressive results have also been achieved regarding rates of Infant mortality and maternal mortality, which are also amongst the lowest in the world.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{documented}} extensive downward rigidity of nominal wages for job stayers in many <b>oecd</b> <b>countries.</b> Individual downward rigidity might induce a positive nominal growth in aggregate wages, to ensure changes in relative wages. A ratchet effect, where workers with fixed wages and secure jobs use threats of reduced effort to enforce a wage hike, would also lead to growth in aggregate wages. However, downward flexibility might be ensured by old, high-wage workers being replaced by young, low-wage workers, or by firms cutting flexible parts of compensation. We explore industry data for 19 <b>oecd</b> <b>countries,</b> over the period 1973 – 99.

40|$|Starting from a {{classification}} of <b>Oecd</b> <b>countries</b> into six {{groups on the}} basis of the prevalent way in which health care is funded, we analysed the composition of the various financing schemes, considering in particular the role of private health insurance. Then, we investigated whether the pre- vailing form of funding health care influenced the trend of expenditure in the period 1960 - 2006. The data examined show that for <b>Oecd</b> <b>countries</b> the total expenditure on health care as a percentage of the GDP is globally stable or, more often, increasing. In the general trend, the traditional relation between different typical health care funding systems is confirmed, namely that national health services are cheaper than social insurance systems, which are cheaper than private insurance-based systems. In ad- dition, the dynamics of total expenditure respect these relations. The public share of total expenditure is stable or increasing. The crisis of the welfare state and the effort to decrease public expenditure af- ter 1980 did not proportionately affect resources devoted to public health care, which increased in re- lation to total public expenditure...|$|R
25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual health care insurance. Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much {{of the cost of}} health care, but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a deductible), or {{a small part of the}} cost of every procedure (a copayment). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries</b> where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.|$|E

The share of public spending in Finland was, however, lower than in all other Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) where it exceeds 80%. As in <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries</b> the health expenditure has been growing steadily since the year 2000. In 2009 health spending per capita in Finland is equal to the OECD average, with spending of EUR 2936 (or USD 3226 adjusted for purchasing power parity).

25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries,</b> U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries,</b> at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP {{for the next}} most expensive country (Switzerland). For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. Healthcare costs are a fundamental driver of health insurance costs, which leads to coverage affordability challenges for millions of families. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{publicly}} funded health care programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor, and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay; however, a system of universal health care has not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most <b>other</b> <b>OECD</b> <b>countries,</b> be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population. Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side. In most OECD countries, there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance. The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs. The U.S., as a matter of oft-stated public policy, largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers, assuming the private sector to do it better.|$|E

The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16–18% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%.

Aging reduces the return from payg pension systems, but increases {{the political power of}} the elderly. The overall effect on the policy-maker decisions is likely to lead to more overall pension spending, although pension per capita may have to be reduced and workers will have to retire later. Yet, the impact on the state regulation of the economy should not be overlooked. An increasing share of elderly individuals will increase the pressure for product market reforms, which lead to lower prices, and thereby to an increase in the purchasing power of their pension transfer. No effect of aging can be instead appreciated on labor market reforms. These suggest that the Southern European system based on large pension spending and rigid labor and product markets is less suited to deal with population aging. ...|$|R
