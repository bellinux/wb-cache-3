5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.

5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> gene {{transfer}} between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, {{as in the}} genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight.

The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> gene {{transfer}} as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E

5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and the increasing number <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins {{were removed from the}} record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower the}} values of {{ionization}} energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, {{and the practice of}} sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> gene transfer.|$|E
