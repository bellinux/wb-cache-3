A new study of California's water supplies by the Division <b>of</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Resources</b> (now California Department <b>of</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Resources,</b> DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E

The {{ecological}} environment in Hotan area had been remained a prominent issue, {{as the most}} important factor among {{ecological environment}}, the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in Hotan area is going to be affected by the vulnerability of the ecological environment. This paper established the Pressure-State-Response model (PSR), made an assessment on the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in Hotan area with comprehensive index method, and the study shows that between 2004 - 2007 in Hotan area, the state <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> vulnerability was getting better; and after 2007, the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> was getting serious.

40|$|A novel dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} model {{based on}} National <b>Water</b> <b>Resource</b> Input Holding Output Table is proposed to calculate the Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China. Unlike previous approaches, the dynamic Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> is largely based on the scarcity extent and can reflect the marginal long-term value in the balanced growth path of China. Firstly, the basic concepts of dynamic Input Output analysis and Turnpike Theory are reviewed. Then, Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (DCGE) is elaborated to calculate the Shadow Price, including the definition and computer-based algorithm. Furthermore, Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China from 1949 to 2050 {{is calculated based on}} the DCGE. Also the sensitivity analysis of the DCGE for Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China is presented. Dynamic Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> has two meanings for China government: (1) Project evaluation. Every large-scale project in China must have national economic evaluation and the dynamic Shadow Price is prerequisite for national economic evaluation. (2) Market price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b> A lesson from this paper is that Shadow Price <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in domestic market of China should be rewritten according to the dynamic Shadow Price. In addition, the parallel computations approach could also be used to solve these problems in different countries or for different natural resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Security {{evaluation}} {{has become}} a hot topic in the research field <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> management. In this paper, we established a novel <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> security indicator system based on the Pressure-Status-Response (PSR) framework using gray relation analysis (GRA) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). A case study of Beijing from 1996 to 2007 was conducted to verify the evaluation system. Results showed that the gray relative closeness degrees <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> security to the positive ideal solution were low, with the least one of 0. 360 in 1999 and the largest one of 0. 527 in 2007, implying that Beijing was facing severer challenges with <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> during the concerned time. Also, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> security indicated that the pressure <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> was constantly increasing. Finally, factor analysis was employed to calculate the gray relation degrees of evaluating indices with the ideal solutions so as to reveal the relativity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> security <b>of</b> Beijing, which may contribute {{to a better understanding}} <b>of</b> the urban <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> management and regulation.

Based on the analysis of other evaluation methods, this paper proposes that the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in the karst region {{is supposed to be}} evaluated from four aspects. They include <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system, <b>water</b> requirement system, ecosystem and social economic system. Then, from these aspects, the evaluation index system for the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in the karst region is established. Meanwhile, the corresponding evaluation method is put forward by combining the AHP method. Afterwards, this method is employed to evaluate the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>of</b> the typical karst region—Zunyi of Guizhou province, China. Furthermore, favorable effect is obtained in the verification based on the regional situation. Therefore, this evaluation method provides a certain basis and reference for evaluating the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in karst regions.|$|R
5|$|The Himalayas {{and other}} {{mountain}} chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions. An estimated 15,000 glaciers {{can be found}} in the greater Himalayas, with double that number in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram and Tien Shan ranges, and comprise the largest glaciated region outside the poles. These glaciers provide critical water supplies to arid countries such as Mongolia, western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9percent reduction in ice mass. Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). If the present trends persist the ice mass will gradually be reduced, and will affect the availability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> though water loss is not expected to cause problems for many decades.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{researches}} on {{the evaluation}} of the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> mainly focus on non-karst regions, while rarely evaluate the sustainability of that in karst regions. With large topographic height difference and developed karst channels, karst regions are generally covered with thin overlying soil (Chu et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2004). These characteristics lead to these regions which have more abundant <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> underground than on the ground; moreover, the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system responds more sensitively to the changes in the surrounding environment. For the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource,</b> except for the influence of the fixed factors <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> it is also related to the water requirement, ecological environment and social economy in the region. Considering this, studying the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> merely from one aspect cannot reflect the whole situation. Therefore, in view <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system, water requirement system, ecosystem and social economic system, the evaluation index system for the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in the karst region is constructed. Based on the system, the typical karst mountainous area, that is, Zunyi, in Guizhou, China, is served as an example to evaluate the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b>|$|R
