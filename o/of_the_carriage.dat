5|$|Huskisson saw the Duke of Wellington {{sitting in}} the front corner of his special carriage. Huskisson walked along the tracks to the carriage, {{extended}} a hand, and the Duke reached out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> and shook it.|$|E
5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the carriage house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E
50|$|Following the railway’s closure, in 1975 <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2-6-2T Hunslet {{locomotives}} to be {{built for}} the railway, No. 85, together with four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> built by <b>the</b> Gloucester Railway <b>Carriage</b> & Wagon Co in 1961, were purchased by the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway (W&LLR) and shipped to Wales, arriving in August that year. After overhauls, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> entered service on W&LLR metals in 1977 followed by the locomotive in 1978.|$|R

50|$|After <b>the</b> demise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> {{were sold}} to Orient-Express Hotels for an {{undisclosed}} price in 2005, for use on their trains overseas. 20 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> remained in storage at the North Ipswich Railway Workshops, with Queensland Rail stating an Orient Express holding company owned them, while an Orient Express Hotels manager in London said they were still owned by Queensland Rail.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse and in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It {{has been said that}} Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung {{to the side of the}} Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Krakatoa begins {{stirring}} for {{the first}} time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a bad dream about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> she is in; Hasan, however, arrives safely in Rangkas Gombong.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{travelled}} through Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia {{before arriving}} in Chalcedon. Here he was arrested, his guise revealed {{after he had}} sent requests for money. Men dispatched by Elagabalus apprehended Macrinus and brought him to Cappadocia. Diadumenian was also captured elsewhere while {{on his way to}} Parthia, and then killed by the centurion Cladius Pollio in Zeugma. French author Jean-Baptiste Crevier comments that Macrinus threw himself out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> at Cappadocia when he received the news of the death of his son, breaking his shoulder doing so. Macrinus was executed in Archemais in Cappadocia after attempting to escape; Dio mentions that the centurion Marcianus Taurus was responsible for his execution. Thus, the reign of Macrinus as emperor of Rome ended after nearly fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage,</b> but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, on the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage,</b> would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E
50|$|Don Remington {{himself was}} a coach-builder, {{carriage}} restorer and coach, carriage and sleigh historian and it is with first-hand knowledge that he restored <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> in his collection. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> in <b>the</b> Remington Museum were used in his lifetime.|$|R
2500|$|Before the 1977–1980 modernisation, the {{stations}} had a distinctive earthy odour. The trains (mostly {{dating back to}} 1896) were always formed with two <b>carriages</b> — <b>the</b> front (motor) <b>carriage</b> with red leather seats and <b>the</b> rear (trailer) <b>carriage</b> with brown leather seats. Smoking was permitted in <b>the</b> rear <b>carriage</b> only. <b>The</b> backs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seats were attached to <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages,</b> which moved semi-independently from the floor (to which the seats themselves were attached); passengers were rocked forwards and backwards while <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> 'shoogled' them around. Passengers always entered at <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train ("Q Here" [...] signs were painted on the platforms), leaving by <b>the</b> front door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>carriage</b> or <b>the</b> rear door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} set <b>of</b> <b>carriages,</b> used between 1854 and 1899, were four-wheeled carriages to a design by Joseph Hamilton Beattie. Little is recorded {{about the number}} and specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages.</b> <b>The</b> same set <b>of</b> <b>carriages</b> remained in use for over 40 years, prompting increasingly strong complaints from the LNC about their deteriorating quality.|$|R
5|$|Andre {{reveals that}} an idol of Baphomet has been {{discovered}} in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre decide that the Templars are going to Bannockburn, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b> However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig the owl flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and {{the lights in the}} compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Clifton Bridge {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays, and passenger numbers fell. The station became an unstaffed halt from 29 October 1962, and in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services ending the next year on 5 July 1965. In the final year of passenger operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> sidings had been taken out of service in 1964, and the others followed in 1966. The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965, and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966. The station buildings were mostly demolished, and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section. Part of the western platform remained in situ, as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter. The station footbridge became part of a footpath. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981. The route however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E
50|$|Both {{cars were}} used as {{accommodation}} on the Wirth's Circus Train in the 1950s. The circus staff complained about <b>the</b> poor condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages,</b> which by that stage were over 60 years old.|$|R
50|$|After the 6-PUL and 6-PAN {{units were}} disbanded, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> {{continued}} {{to run in}} service together with former 4-RES and 4-COR stock. These reformed units were classified either 4-PUL, 4-COR, 4-COR(N), 6-COR or 6-TC.|$|R
5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> seats {{was increased}} from 264 to 309 {{by changing the}} seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens on <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> were moved from <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s {{to be similar to}} the series trains.|$|R
25|$|In both {{arrangements}} carry-on baggage is stowed {{on a shelf}} {{above the}} passenger seating area. The opening into the cars is usually located at both ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage,</b> often into a small hallway - which in railway parlance is termed a vestibule.|$|E
25|$|During the {{extensive}} repairs at TTTK in Tallinn, number 9 and 12 have been painted with {{a modified version}} of the original livery, with added silver decorative stripes; one running between the yellow and green fields, and another near the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{firearms}} officers {{boarded the}} train and it was initially claimed they challenged the suspect, though later reports indicate he was not challenged. According to Hotel 3, Menezes then stood up and advanced towards the officers and Hotel 3, at which point Hotel 3 grabbed him, pinned his arms against his torso, and pushed {{him back into the}} seat. Although Menezes was being restrained, his body was straight and not in a natural sitting position. Hotel 3 heard a shot close to his ear, and was dragged away onto the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b> He shouted 'Police!' and with hands raised was dragged out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> by one of the armed officers who had boarded the train. Hotel 3 then heard several gunshots while being dragged out.|$|E
50|$|C 2706 to 2729. Twenty-four {{third class}} coaches with five {{compartments}} and access platforms {{were used by}} <b>the</b> OR. Some <b>carriages</b> were used up until 1934 by the Etat, especially between Pallet and Vallet. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> were transformed into service coaches around 1903.|$|R
50|$|All {{except one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> are {{equipped}} with electric heating, for winter services. All carriages {{are equipped with}} internal lighting. All carriages are connected to a passenger communication system, allowing passengers to stop the train in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> demise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train, <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> {{passed to}} <b>the</b> Australian Railway Historical Society, Canberra and New South Wales Rail Transport Museum who have maintained them in operational condition. The latter often operates them on tours under the Southern Aurora banner.|$|R
25|$|Despite their diesel engines, {{the trains}} are quite comfortable; even for {{passengers}} sitting directly above the motors, {{the ride is}} quiet and smooth. Seats are arranged with two on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage,</b> and the rows alternate facing directions, such that half the seats are facing forward in either direction of travel.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Darlington Borough Council {{decided to}} move the North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group into the unrefurbished north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage</b> works, meaning the trust {{consolidated}} in the southern half of the building. As such, the works consist of a space less than 30 metres long by 15 metres wide.|$|E
25|$|Tram number 45, {{the first}} to be modernised into Nr I+ class, was painted in an {{experimental}} livery coinciding with the modernisation. The livery was identical with the standard green/yellow colours, but had an additional narrow yellow stripe running along the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage.</b> This livery was not adapted to any other trams, and number 45 later reverted to the standard livery.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled {{to a combination of}} both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. <b>The</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> is painted grey. Red colouring at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> each car forms red parallelograms when <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|R
2500|$|On July 28, 2014, a {{cable that}} caused <b>the</b> {{swinging}} <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> on <b>the</b> pendulum snapped, injuring two riders.

500|$|This {{ground floor}} museum {{exhibits}} carriages and other conveyances {{used by the}} Grand Ducal court mainly in the late 18th and 19th century. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exhibition prompted one visitor in the 19th century to wonder, [...] "In <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> all that is extraordinary, how can they find room for all these carriages and horses". Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriages</b> are highly decorative, being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels. [...] Those used on the grandest occasions, such as the [...] "Carrozza d'Oro" [...] (golden carriage), are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carriage's</b> occupants. [...] Other carriages on view are those used by <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Two Sicilies, and Archbishops and other Florentine dignitaries.|$|R
