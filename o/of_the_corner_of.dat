25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> their eye that really is not there. Most persons {{come to terms with}} the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his mouth [...] "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he had eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the guy, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E

The Union Army hanged Clarke {{three days later}} just west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> 18th and Broadway in Louisville, after a military trial {{in which he was}} charged as a guerrilla. During the secret three-hour trial, Clarke was not allowed counsel or witnesses for his defense, although he asked to be treated as a prisoner of war. Magruder was allowed to recover from war injuries before being executed by hanging on October 29.|$|E
2500|$|Warner Bros. was {{not happy}} with an early cut of The Outsiders and passed on distributing Rumble Fish. Despite the lack of {{financing}} in place, Coppola completely recorded the film on video during two weeks of rehearsals in a former school gymnasium and afterwards was able to show {{the cast and crew}} a rough draft of the film. To get Rourke into the mindset of his character, Coppola gave him books written by Albert Camus and a biography of Napoleon. The Motorcycle Boy's look was patterned after Camus complete with trademark cigarette dangling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his mouth— taken from a photograph of the author that Rourke used as a visual handle. Rourke remembers that he approached his character as [...] "an actor who no longer finds his work interesting".|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire {{suggests}} that the odd sensations that people attribute to ghosts {{may be caused by}} infrasonic vibrations. Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University's psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called [...] "Ghosts in the Machine" [...] for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Their research suggested that an infrasonic signal of 19Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye. When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.|$|E

2500|$|What {{is now the}} Detroit Financial District was {{the site}} of the {{construction}} of the first building in Detroit, Ste. Anne's Catholic Church, constructed in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac. [...] Ste. Anne's stood at the southern edge of the district, just west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Jefferson Avenue and Griswold Streets, [...] where the Standard Savings & Loan Building is today. A stockade, later known as Fort Detroit, was constructed around the church and southward. Portions of the fort, as well as the church and other buildings, were destroyed and rebuilt multiple times during the next few decades. By the time the fort was surrendered to British forces in 1760, it encompassed an area stretching from the present Griswold Street to west of Shelby Street, and from south or Larned Street to a block south of Jefferson Avenue. [...] In the 1770s the fort was again extended, encompassing the entire area from the Detroit River to Larned Street, and from Griswold Street west to Cass Avenue.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy is {{the common}} name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone {{representing}} about 40% of the skeleton of an individual Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy is reckoned to have lived 3.2 million years ago. This hominid was significant as the skeleton shows evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal upright walk akin to that of humans, providing further evidence that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution. While working in collaboration with a joint French-British-American team, Lucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye, and recognized it as hominid. Later described as the first known member of Australopithecus afarensis. [...] Dr. Johanson's girlfriend suggested she be named [...] "Lucy" [...] after the Beatles' song [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] which was played repeatedly during {{the night of the}} discovery.|$|E
2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, {{in the general direction of}} her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E

2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosenthal piled {{stones and}} a sandbag {{so he had}} {{something}} on which to stand, as he was only 5 feet and 5inches (1.65m) tall. He set his camera for a lens setting between f/8 and f/11 and the shutter speed at 1/400th second. Then, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> his eye, he saw six Marines start to raise the second flag. He swung his camera around toward the action and pushed the shutter. Three feet to his right, Sgt. Genaust captured the flag-raising from nearly the same angle using color motion picture film. To make sure he had a worthwhile photo to send to the AP, Rosenthal took another black and white photograph showing four of the second flag-raisers steadying the flagstaff waiting for {{the bottom of the}} pipe to be more secured with rocks; and afterwards a rope. When that was done, Rosenthal gathered a group of sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen {{around the base of the}} flagstaff for a posed shot (called the [...] "Gung Ho" [...] photo) which included First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the only officer on the summit, who had volunteered to take the 40-man patrol up Mount Suribachi that morning to seize and occupy the crest and raise the battalion's flag.|$|E
