25|$|Into {{the early}} decades of the twentieth century Vietnam, young men and women used the festival as a chance to meet future life companions.

Those who performed poorly were sidelined until one young man and <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> remained, after which they would win prizes as well as entertain matrimonial prospects.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{people were}} killed outright, and another two died over the {{following}} days and weeks. Thirteen of the fourteen victims were women, including one who was nine months pregnant. <b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> who had been beside the bomb car was decapitated; the only clue to her sex was the pair of brown platform boots she was wearing. Several others lost limbs and a man was impaled through the abdomen by an iron bar. Several bodies lay in the street {{for half an hour}} as ambulances struggled to get through traffic jams. At least four bodies were found on the pavement outside Guineys. The bodies of the victims were covered by newspapers until they were removed from the scene.|$|E

500|$|Angelou expands upon many {{themes that}} she started {{discussing}} {{in her first}} autobiography, including motherhood and family, racism, identity, education and literacy. [...] Rita becomes closer to her mother in this book, and goes {{through a variety of}} jobs and relationships as she tries to provide for her young son and find her place in the world. [...] Angelou continues to discuss racism in Gather Together, but moves from speaking for all Black women to describing how <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> dealt with it. [...] The book exhibits the narcissism of young people, but describes how Rita discovers her identity. [...] Like many of Angelou's autobiographies, Gather Together is concerned with Angelou's on-going self-education.|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

2500|$|St Lawrence's Hospital, Caterham, Surrey: in March 1944 a {{programme}} of leucotomy {{was begun}} on [...] "mental defectives". Crumbie operated on one patient, McKissock and his assistant, McCall, on a further 43 (nine of {{them under the}} age of 21). There were five deaths and the majority of patients showed little or no improvement, with twelve of them becoming worse. Doctors at St Lawrence’s Hospital decided to abandon the experiment. Rampton Hospital, another mental deficiency institution, began using psychosurgery in January 1947. Twenty patients including a fourteen-year-old underwent surgery in little over a year. One patient died. Superintendent George Mackay found the results sufficiently encouraging to extend the programme to include [...] "a wider group of clinical types". <b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> who underwent a leucotomy turned out to have been detained illegally for eighteen years.|$|E
2500|$|Butcher's debut memoir, Visiting Hours: A Memoir of Friendship and Murder, was {{published}} in April 2015 by Penguin-Random House imprint Blue Rider Press. It recounts her struggle to reconcile her friendship with her college friend Kevin Schaeffer, who violently murdered his girlfriend after a psychotic break. The book was featured on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday with Rachel Martin, WAMC's The Roundtable, and Poets & Writers Magazine. The New York Times Sunday Review of Books writes that [...] "at {{the heart of this}} story, beyond Butcher's search to understand the incomprehensible, lies our societal failure to recognize serious depression as the potentially fatal illness that it is..." [...] and that [...] "her research offers a tragic portrait of the turn of events that left <b>one</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> dead and another forever changed." [...] (The New York Times Sunday Review of Books, July 15, 2015) NPR's Rachel Martin describes the book as [...] "a haunting meditation on human fragility." [...] (NPR, March 30, 2015). The Star Tribune writes that the book is [...] "riveting and visceral..." [...] and that [...] "Butcher is unflinching in her self-examination and masterful at it." [...] (The Star Tribune, May 4, 2015) Kirkus Reviews describes the book as [...] "gripping and poignant" [...] (Kirkus Reviews, January 1, 2015), Biographile writes that it is [...] "enthralling, thought provoking, and deeply empathetic," [...] (Biographile, April 9, 2015), and Glamour writes that it is [...] "emotional, powerful, and oddly enough, beautiful."

2500|$|One of {{the wounded}} was a child whose {{injuries}} had been so severe that a rescue worker at the scene assumed the child had been killed. <b>One</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> lost both legs; she was photographed by Derek Brind of the Associated Press as a British Paratrooper held her in his arms. Passerby Frank Heagan witnessed the explosion and came upon {{what was left of}} two binmen who had been [...] "blown to pieces". He added that [...] "there was blood everywhere and people moaning and screaming. The street was full of girls and women all wandering around". The injured could be heard screaming as the ambulances transported them to hospital; emergency amputations were performed at the scene. One policeman angrily denounced the attack by stating: [...] "This was a deliberate attempt to kill innocent people. The people who planted it must have known that people were being evacuated into its path". Whilst the security forces and firemen pulled victims from the debris in Donegall Street, two more bombs went off elsewhere in the city centre; however, nobody was hurt in either attack. That same day in Derry, a British soldier, John Taylor, was shot dead by an IRA sniper. In Dublin, the IRA's Chief of Staff, Seán Mac Stíofáin, suffered burns to his face and hands after he had opened a letter bomb sent to him through the post. Cathal Goulding, head of the Official IRA, also received a letter bomb but escaped injury by having dismantled the device before it exploded.|$|E
