30|$|As {{indicated}} by Figure  2, the mean {{values of the}} ultimate drift capacity for walls failing in flexural, hybrid and shear failure modes were 1.21 %, 0.96 % and 0.40 %, respectively. The deformation capacity <b>of</b> <b>walls</b> that have undergone a shear-dominated failure mode is much lower than that <b>of</b> <b>walls</b> failing by hybrid or flexure-dominated modes. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} the global displacement capacity of unreinforced masonry structures is mostly controlled by the displacement capacity <b>of</b> <b>walls</b> failing in shear-dominated modes. In the following, we will discuss the ultimate drift capacity <b>of</b> <b>walls</b> with shear-dominated failure modes in more detail.|$|R

These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri.
