5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant,</b> the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulation can be {{achieved}} {{through a number of}} means including warfarin, heparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban. Aspirin is less effective in reducing the risk of stroke and may not be safer with respect to major bleeding (including intracranial bleeding) than well-managed warfarin or a non-vitamin K <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> (NOAC). A number of issues should be considered, including the cost of NOACs, risk of stroke, risk of falls, compliance, and speed of desired onset of anticoagulation.|$|E

Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> may be recommended.

40|$|Background. <b>Oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> are {{associated}} with a decrease in bone mass density. Our study evaluates the association between an osteoporotic fracture and <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants.</b> Methods. We conducted a case-control study on subjects aged 70 years and older enrolled in the Quebec health insurance plan between 1992 and 1994. Incident cases of an osteoporotic fracture (index event) were identified by ICD- 9 codes and surgical procedure codes. Exposure defined as one or more prescriptions of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> dispensed before the index event. Ten controls for each case, matched by age and date of index event, were selected. Results. Among 1, 523 cases, 48 (3. 2 %) were exposed to oral an anticoagulant; among 15, 205 controls, 461 (3. 0 %) were exposed (adjusted odds ratio: 1. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 8 [...] 1. 4).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Platelet {{activation}} plays a {{major role}} in acute vessel closure after coronary angioplasty. In the randomized Balloon Angioplasty and Anticoagulation Study (BAAS), pretreatment with <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> in addition to aspirin resulted in a 47 % reduction of acute complications as compared with aspirin alone. This result may suggest a direct effect of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> on platelet activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomized to aspirin alone (group A, n = 26) or to aspirin plus <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> started one week before angioplasty (group B, n = 26). Platelet response tests were performed 1 hour before (baseline) and 1 hour after intervention and on day 1. Platelet activation was measured by flow cytometry, as the number of antibody-positive platelets per 10, 000 counted. Platelet function was evaluated with use of the PFA- 100 (R) analyzer. In group B, the median number of P-selectin-positive platelets was lower before (28 vs. 54, P = 0. 018) and after (13 vs. 24, P = 0. 377) angioplasty than in group A. Also the median decrease in the number of P-selectin-positive platelets during angioplasty was lower in group B (Delta = 4) than in group A (Delta = 30, P = 0. 022). No further significant change was observed in platelet activation on day 1 in the two groups. The ability of platelets to become stimulated as measured with the PFA- 100 (R) analyzer was not affected by <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> resulted in less activated platelets before and after coronary angioplasty, which is in agreement with its clinical effect of reducing procedural complications.
