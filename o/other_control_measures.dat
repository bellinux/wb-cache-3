The first field test in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings was carried out in central Italy in the spring of 1944. The objective was to determine the residual effect of the spray upon Anopheline density in the absence of <b>other</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> Spraying began in Castel Volturno and, after a few months, in the delta of the Tiber. The unprecedented effectiveness of the chemical was confirmed: the new insecticide was able to eradicate malaria by eradicating mosquitoes. At the end of World War II, a massive malaria control program based on DDT spraying was carried out in Italy. In Sardinia – the second largest island in the Mediterranean – between 1946 and 1951, the Rockefeller Foundation conducted a large-scale experiment to test the feasibility of the strategy of [...] "species eradication" [...] in an endemic malaria vector. Malaria was effectively eliminated in the United States by the use of DDT in the National Malaria Eradication Program (1947–52). The concept of eradication prevailed in 1955 in the Eighth World Health Assembly: DDT was adopted as a primary tool in the fight against malaria.|$|E

50|$|The rust species Puccinia obtegens {{has shown}} some promise for {{controlling}} Canada thistle, {{but it must}} be used in conjunction with <b>other</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> to be effective. Also Puccinia punctiformis is used in North America and New Zealand in biological control. In 2013 it was demonstrated in four countries in three continents that epidemics of systemic disease caused by this rust fungus could be routinely and easily established. The procedure for establishing this control agent involves three simple steps and is a long-term sustainable control solution that is free and does not involve herbicides. A tutorial for this procedure can be found at http://www.canadathistlecontrol.com/. Plants systemically diseased with the rust gradually but surely die. Reductions in thistle density were estimated, in 10 sites in the U.S., Greece, and Russia, to average 43%, 64%, and 81% by 18, 30, and 42 months, respectively, after a single application of spores of the fungus.|$|E
5000|$|The best {{strategy}} to manage this disease {{is to avoid}} infection of stumps. To do this, do not cut trees at major sporulation times, which are summer to late fall, and treat fresh stumps with protectants such as borax, which is registered as cellu-treat or sporax, either as a powder or in aqueous form. These treatments are most effective if done immediately after stump is created (the tree is cut). <b>Other</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> include: use wide spacing when planting to {{reduce the need for}} thinning and reduce the potential root grafts, thin only when spores are less abundant, (January through March), and plant tree species that are less susceptible. Another strategy is to avoid logging injuries as the spores enter through such injuries and infect and kill the tree and begin a disease center. Once the fungus is in the stand there is nothing that can be done about it except extremely expensive stump removal and prevention of new infections.|$|E

Here it flourished and is now considered to be an invasive species and a serious threat to the ecosystem. In Florida it has no host-specific natural enemies and the introduction of certain insect species from Australia to help control it is being investigated. USDA scientists imported four insect species into quarantine for evaluation. Of these, the melaleuca leaf weevil seems the most promising.
