5|$|Mycenaean {{domestic}} architecture originates {{mainly from}} earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, {{as well as}} in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.|$|E
5|$|Thus, a release-critical bug in a {{new version}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> library on which many {{packages}} depend may prevent those packages from entering Testing, because the updated library must meet the requirements too.

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
5|$|In New York Bond meets up {{with his}} {{counterpart}} in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream American cuisine {{is similar}} to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These home grown foods are part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the illusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree}} that it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I analyse {{the issue}} of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> in <b>a</b> limited liability company {{which is one of the}} most common legal dispositions with the share. The work is based on the new legal regulation of private law which will come into effect on 1 January 2014 but at the same time it compares the existing and new legislation. Besides the applicable law, the work examines the legal literature, periodicals, as well as the case law of the Czech courts. The main contribution of this work is to provide a possible future interpretation of some institutes associated with the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> as well as to point out the changes that the new legislation will bring. The work is divided into five chapters whereas each of the chapters focuses on the specific issue of the share transfer. The first chapter defines the <b>share</b> in <b>a</b> limited liability company and introduces it as <b>an</b> eligible subject-matter <b>of</b> the legal relations. The second chapter deals with the various modes of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> and certain preconditions of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> such as the consents with the transfer and the necessary respect of the duty of loyal behaviour of the company's members. The subject of the third chapter represent the chosen institutes related to the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>share,</b> namely the acquirer's [...] ...|$|R

Its diversity of bands and musical styles indicated that emo was more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> aesthetic than a genre, and the series helped define the term in the underground-music community.|$|E

Consistent with our hypothesis, empirical evidence indicates that cross-sectional variation of the premia <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>shares</b> is negatively related to the relative supply <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>shares,</b> and positively related to the relative of B shares. We also find that shares in circulation (effective supply <b>of</b> <b>shares)</b> is <b>a</b> better proxy than the total shares outstanding (total supply of stocks) in explaining the premia. Finally, {{there is little evidence that}} the premia is explained by the beta risk and liquidity risk...|$|R
