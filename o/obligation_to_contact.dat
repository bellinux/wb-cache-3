5000|$|After Vahey's {{long history}} of child abuse came to light, Gloria Doll {{said that he had}} become [...] "famous for wanting to lead student {{experience}} trips", and that this was the reason many of his previous schools hired him. She also said that, to her knowledge, none of her students had been molested by him. Doll faced some criticism for not acting sooner to stop him from doing so while she was director of the American Nicaraguan School. Three of the school's employees, for instance, wrote an anonymous letter stating that Doll, after acquiring Vahey's memory stick, fired him, but still let him go home. Doll said she had consulted a school board member and the school's lawyer prior to making this decision, and said the lawyer had told her that since none {{of the children in the}} photos had been molested in Nicaragua, they had no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> authorities. The employees pointed out that child pornography is illegal in Nicaragua no matter what. After she resigned her position at the school on May 20, many speculated that this was for reasons relating to her handling of this scandal. Nevertheless, the school board, who had supported her for the previous several weeks, treated her resignation as a routine matter that had nothing to do with the Vahey scandal.|$|E

An investigation was conducted to identify and examine the influences on the frequency of, and motivation for, contact with adult siblings. Twenty-one variables identified by the literature as affecting the frequency of contact between adult siblings were examined. These included relationship, sibling structure, family structure, demographic, and proximity variables. Using a two-stage systematic sampling procedure of telephone and mail surveys, a., sample of 313 adults over age 25 who had living siblings was obtained.

40|$|We {{naturally}} attribute <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups, {{and take}} such <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> have {{consequences for the}} obligations of group members. The threat posed by anthropogenic climate change provides an urgent case. It seems that we, together, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prevent climate catastrophe, and that we, as individuals, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> contribute. However, understood strictly, attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups might seem illegitimate. On the one hand, the groups in question—the people alive today, say—are rarely fully-fledged moral agents, making it unclear {{how they can be}} subjects of obligations. On the other, the attributions can rarely be understood distributively, as concerned with members’ <b>obligations,</b> because <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> do something require a capacity to do it, and individual members often lack the relevant capacities. Moreover, even if groups can have obligations, it is unclear why that would be relevant for members, exactly because members often lack control over whether group obligations are fulfilled. In previous work, I have argued that a general understanding of individual <b>obligations</b> extends non-mysteriously <b>to</b> irreducibly shared <b>obligations,</b> rendering attributions of <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> groups legitimate. In this paper, I spell out how the proposed account also helps us understand the relation between individual and shared obligations. Even though few individual human agents have any significant control over whether we will be successful in preventing climate catastrophe, our collective capacity to prevent catastrophe and shared preventative <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> do so can give rise <b>to</b> significant individual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> contribute to its fulfillment...|$|R

Therefore, the first chapter is devoted to the legal nature of the doctor-patient relationship.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{an explanation}} of why {{the state has a}} special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect individuals in its legal territory against violence committed by private actors. Having {{an explanation of}} this obligation will allow us to better determine a number of its major characteristics, including to whom the state owes this obligation [...] the scope of the obligation [...] apart from those persons actually located in the state's legal territory. It argues that the state has a special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect because the state is the fiduciary of those individuals in its legal territory and has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> advance their purposes reasonably. Since obtaining security from violence is a normal and fundamental purpose of individuals, the state has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect them from private violence. To support this conclusion, the dissertation evaluates whether the most plausible explanations of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect can account for our moral intuitions. Apart from the fiduciary explanation, it considers and rejects four alternatives. First, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect might arise as an application of an inherent duty to promote justice, including by protecting against acts of violence. Second, it might arise because the state normally contributes causally to the harm from most or all acts of violence that occur in its territory, so it has an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect against that harm. Third, it might arise because the state implicitly promises to protect by communicating a claim that it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Fourth, it might arise because the exercise of coercive political control is legitimate only if the state simultaneously protects against violence. After rejecting these alternatives, the dissertation explains, defends, and applies the fiduciary account {{to the question of the}} scope of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect...|$|R
