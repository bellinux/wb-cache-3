60|$|These {{sketches}} {{or parts}} of sketches all belong to that period in his later life when he had undertaken the duties of an editor, the very heavy duties of a very popular editor. He was {{not by any means}} naturally fitted for that position. He was the best man in the world for founding papers; but many people wished that he could have been buried under the foundations, like the first builder in some pagan and prehistoric pile. He called the Daily News into existence, but when once it existed, it objected to him strongly. It is not easy, and perhaps it is not important, to state truly the cause of this incapacity. It was not in the least what is called the <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault</b> or weakness of the artist. It was not that he was careless; rather it was that he was too conscientious. It was not that he had the irresponsibility of genius; rather it was that he had the irritating responsibility of genius; he wanted everybody to see things as he saw them. But in spite of all this he certainly ran two great popular periodicals--Household Words and All the Year Round--with enormous popular success. And he certainly so far succeeded in throwing himself into the communism of journalism, into the nameless brotherhood of a big paper, that many earnest Dickensians are still engaged in picking out pieces of Dickens from the anonymous pages of Household Words and All the Year Round, and those parts which have been already beyond question picked out and proved are often fragmentary. The genuine writing of Dickens breaks off at a certain point, and the writing of some one else begins. But when the writing of Dickens breaks off, I fancy that we know it.|$|E
40|$|A fast fault {{simulation}} approach based on ordinary logic emulation is proposed. The circuit configured into our system that emulates the faulty circuit’s behavior is synthesized {{from the good}} circuit and the given fault list in a novel way. Fault injection is made easy by shifting the content of a fault injection scan chain or by selecting the output of a parallel fault injection selector, with which {{we get rid of}} the time-consuming bit-stream regeneration process. Experimental results for ISCAS- 89 benchmark circuits show that our serial fault emulator is about 20 times faster than HOPE. The speedup grows with the circuit size by our analysis. Two hybrid fault emulation approaches are also proposed. The first reduces the number of faults actually emulated by screening off faults not activated or with short propagation distances before emulation, and by collapsing nonstem faults into their equivalent stem faults. The second reduces the hardware requirement of the fault emulator by incorporating an <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault</b> simulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis of}} the Article {{is that the}} {{expansion}} of tort liability based on strict liability or enterprise liability {{without regard to the}} proper measurement of damages in such cases {{is at the root of}} the insurance crisis rather than the awarding of excessive damages in <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault</b> cases. Stated another way, the expansion of tort liability was based upon the appropriateness of internalizing the cost of economic activity by spreading the risk among the beneficiaries of such activity, but the damages were measured under full compensation theories rather than a more appropriate insurance approach. This divergence between basing liability upon insurance principles and measuring damages upon fault principles has resulted in the failure of businesses to incorporate the legal charges against them within the price of their product. The authors 2 ̆ 7 solution is to match appropriately damages to liability while protecting the constitutional right of individuals to life, liberty, and property. This solution necessarily includes the right of an individual to be free from intentional or careless injury to his or her bodily integrity...|$|E

40|$|An {{earthquake}} with an M_S = 5. 6 (m_b= 5. 5) {{which occurred}} near Torishima, Japan, on June 13, 1984, generated abnormally large tsunamis (tsunami magnitude M_t = 7. 3) for its relatively small earthquake magnitude. The maximum amplitude of the tsunamis {{is not a}} simple function of distance as the magnitude formula implies. In order to quantify the abnormal tsunamis, we modeled the tsunami source using a finite difference computation on the actual bathymetry. The source of these abnormal tsunamis is modeled as a water surface displacement, with a radius of 12 km and maximum water height of 13 cm. The displaced water volume is 4 × 10 ^(13) cm^ 3, and the potential energy is calculated as 2 × 10 ^(17) ergs. If this water displacement is due to a fault motion at 5 km depth, a moment magnitude M_w is estimated to be 6. 3. This value is larger than M_w estimated from seismic waves by 0. 7, but smaller than M_t by 1. 0. The former difference suggests that the earthquake source is very different from an <b>ordinary</b> <b>faulting.</b> If we assume the source is a horizontally lying tensile crack at shallow depth (about 2 km), that explains both the water surface displacement and the seismic moment tensor. The tensile crack is interpreted as an injection of material, as suggested by a seismological study. The discrepancy between M_w and M_t indicates that the propagation path is responsible for the observed large tsunamis. The numerical computation shows a focusing of energy during the propagation of the tsunami along the shallow Izu-Bonin ridge system. Thus the abnormally large tsunamis from the Torishima earthquake are a result of both source and path effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} methodology for designing fault-protection (FP) software for autonomous spacecraft. The methodology embodies and extends established engineering {{practices in the}} technical discipline of Fault Detection, Diagnosis, Mitigation, and Recovery; and has been successfully implemented in the Deep Impact Spacecraft, a NASA Discovery mission. Based on established concepts of Fault Monitors and Responses, this FP methodology extends the notion of Opinion, Symptom, Alarm (aka Fault), and Response with numerous new notions, sub-notions, software constructs, and logic and timing gates. For example, Monitor generates a RawOpinion, which graduates into Opinion, categorized into no-opinion, acceptable, or unacceptable opinion. RaiseSymptom, ForceSymptom, and ClearSymptom govern the establishment and then mapping to an Alarm (aka Fault). Local Response is distinguished from FP System Response. A 1 -to-n and n-to- 1 mapping is established among Monitors, Symptoms, and Responses. Responses are categorized by device versus by function. Responses operate in tiers, where the early tiers attempt to resolve the Fault in a localized step-by-step fashion, relegating more system-level response to later tier(s). Recovery actions are gated by epoch recovery timing, enabling strategy, urgency, MaxRetry gate, hardware availability, hazardous versus <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault,</b> and many other priority gates. This methodology is systematic, logical, and uses multiple linked tables, parameter files, and recovery command sequences. The credibility of the FP design is proven via a fault-tree analysis "top-down" approach, and a functional fault-mode-effects-and-analysis via "bottoms-up" approach. Via this process, the mitigation and recovery strategy(s) per Fault Containment Region scope (width versus depth) the FP architecture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Displacement, {{length and}} linkage of {{deformation}} bands {{have been studied}} in Jurassic sandstones in southeastern Utah. Isolated deformation bands with lengths (L) that span more than three orders of magnitude show similar displacement (D) profiles with more or less centrally located maxima and gently increasing gradient toward the tips. Soft- and hard-linked examples exhibit steeper displacement gradients near overlap zones and immature hard links, similar to previously described fault populations. The deformation band population shows power-law length and displacement distributions, but with lower exponents than commonly observed for populations of larger faults or small faults with distinct slip surfaces. Similarly, the Q,,,,-L relationship of the deformation bands shows a well-defined exponent of ca 0. 5, whereas the general disagreement for other fault populations is whether the exponent is 1 or 1. 5. We suggest that this important difference in scaling law between deformation bands and other faults {{has to do with}} the lack of well-developed slip surfaces in deformation bands. During growth, deformation bands link to form zones of densely spaced bands, and a slip surface is eventually formed (when 100 m < L < 1 km). The growth and scaling relationship for the resulting populations of faults (slip surfaces) is expected to be similar to ‘ordinary ’ fault populations. A change in the D,,,-L scaling relationship at the point when zones of deformation bands develop slip surfaces is expected to be a general feature in porous sandstones where faults with slip surfaces develop from deformation bands. Down-scaling of <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault</b> populations into the size domain of deformation bands in porous sandstones is therefore potentially dangerous...|$|E
40|$|Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a {{valuable}} systems analysis technique widely used in safety analysis and reliability engineering, {{but it is not}} without its faults; in particular, it struggles to analyse systems in which time plays an important role, because fault trees use only Boolean logic and so there is no simple way of representing time or sequences of events in a fault tree. Although there have been attempts to extend FTA to enable analysis of such systems, most have focused on probabilistic analysis and there remains a need for a technique that allows logical analysis of dynamic systems. Pandora is a technique that aims to provide a solution to this problem. It is based around three logical gates capable of representing sequences: the Priority-AND (PAND) gate, the Simultaneous-AND gate (SAND), and the Priority-OR gate (POR). These three "temporal" gates are more expressive, allowing analysts to model sequences as part of a fault tree and thus enabling fault trees to analyse more complex dynamic systems. In addition, Pandora provides a set of logical rules {{that can be used to}} reduce fault trees incorporating the three new gates in much the same way that existing Boolean laws can be used to reduce <b>ordinary</b> <b>fault</b> trees. This makes it possible to perform logical analysis of fault trees using Pandora, the results of which provide the analyst with information about the weak points of the system by showing what combinations or sequences of event can cause the system to fail. This thesis presents the evolution of Pandora thus far, explaining the background that led to its inception and the choices made during its development as well as detailed explanations of how Pandora is applied. Pandora has been created with possible automation in mind, so there is also a description of some preliminary algorithms that support Pandora-based FTA. Pandora is then applied to a case study to demonstrate how it can function in practice. Finally, the success of Pandora is evaluated by contrasting it with other temporal FTA approaches as well as standard non-dynamic analysis and from this conclusions about the potential benefits of using Pandora are drawn...|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems bolted short-circuits are rare and the fault usually involves arcing and burning; mostly the limit value of minimum short-circuit depends really on arcing-fault. In AC low voltage systems, the paper examines the arcing-fault branch circuits as weak points. Different protection measures are available against the arc-faults. A first measure that can guarantee a probabilistic protection is {{allowed by the}} adoption of overcurrent protective devices (OCPD), optimizing {{the design of the}} structure of the system and/or the coordination of protection.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure. The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by <b>ordinary</b> ground <b>fault</b> protective devices (GFPDs).

40|$|The focal {{process of}} a deep shock which {{occurred}} at 580 km depth in the Banda Sea region in 1964 is investigated by using long period P and S waves from WWSSN seismograms. The two nodal planes of this earthquake are given by dip direction= 319 °, dip angle= 45 °, and dip direction= 180 °, dip angle= 53 °, respectively. Assuming that a rectangle represents a far field pulse form, the S wave seismograms are synthesized for various pulse widths and epicentral distances. The effects on the wave form due to passage through the mantle, crust and instrument are removed. Trials are made to find the pulse width, Ts, of the original rectangular pulse which fits the observed S wave form. The variation of Ts {{with respect to the}} fault plane orientation is investigated. Ts is remarkably well correlated with the emergence angle measured from the slip vector on the nodal plane with dip direction= 319 °, dip angle= 45 °. This result, leads to the following conclusions: (1) The source is plane-like rather than spherical; a fault, model is more preferable to a phase transition model. (2) The nodal plane with dip direction= 319 ° and dip angle= 45 ° is the fault plane. (3) The fault surface is not circular but elongated. (4) The direction of elongation coincides, with the slip direction. (5) The fault width W should not exceed 15 km. It may. probably be smaller than 10 km. (6) The fault length L is estimated to be 40. km. (7) The process of the body wave radiation took place almost simultaneously, within about two seconds, over the entire fault surface; this model is significantly different from the <b>ordinary</b> propagating <b>fault</b> model. On the basis of this model, the seismic moment M 0 is estimated to be 5. 8 × 1026 dyne cm from the P wave amplitude and width. Assuming W= 8 km, the average dislocation, stress drop and elastic energy released when the fault surfaces become free, are. estimated to be 150 cm, 290 bars and 7. 0 × 1022 ergs, respectively. The stress drop obtained here is one order of magnitude greater than that estimated for shallow earthquakes. | 1964 年バンダ海で起った深さ 580 kmの深発地震の震源過程を世界標準地震計観測網が記録した. 長周期P波およびS波を用いて調べた. この地震の 2 つのP波節面はdip direction= 319 °dip angle= 45 °およびdip direction＝ 180 °, dip angle＝ 53 °で与えられる.

It is common that we often face interrupted service (caused either by an intermittent fault in an application program or in hardware), during the service delivery period {{of an ordinary}} cheaper application system. Execution of an application program often show malfunctions or it gets interrupted due to memory bit errors. Error Correction Codes (ECC) (viz., parity, Hamming codes, CRC etc.,) {{that are used in}} memory, are not as effective for online correction of multiple bit errors, as they are, for the detection of few bit errors. Again, software implemented ECC has a significant overhead over both time and code redundancy. In other words, built in ECC in memory, cannot recover all bit errors but can detect only. As a result, if an error is detected by ECC, the application program needs to be restarted for its re-execution afresh in various microprocessor based application systems. So, the ECC alone is useful for designing a fail-stop kind of system but it suffers from high time redundancy. Other software implemented fault- tolerance schemes are also towards fail-stop kind. But, the proposed (SV) based approach is capable of tolerating such errors without stopping the execution of an application. This SV Scheme (SVS) aims to provide an uninterrupted service at no extra money, but at an acceptable more execution time and memory space. This SV is a non- fail-stop kind fault tolerance scheme that can be implemented in various computing systems without spending an additional money, and as a result, major part of common people in our society, can gain reliable service from the low-cost, SV-based computing system.
