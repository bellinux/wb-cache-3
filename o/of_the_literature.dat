5|$|The nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> {{of antiquity}} and {{the form of}} the ancient book {{reciprocally}} conditioned each other.

5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and {{a few members of}} the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E

5|$|In a 2003 review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> Rowan et al. {{proposed}} {{one model}} for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, {{at least in}} part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
5|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics is a 2014 edited {{collection}} {{published by}} Palgrave Macmillan and edited by the green political theorists Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg.
