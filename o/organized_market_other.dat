Merchants in the <b>organized</b> <b>markets</b> issue bills of exchange. Pareto-ranked multiple equilibria exist with {{the extent of the}} market and circulation of private liabilities endogenously determined. If trade frictions are moderate, bills circulate as a general medium of exchange, and the level of specialization is higher relative to barter. In this case, higher inside liquidity is accompanied by more specialization. When all transactions take place in the <b>organized</b> <b>markets,</b> trading risk vanishes and the economy achieves complete specialization. ...|$|R

Within these centers, there were <b>organized</b> <b>markets</b> that lowered the cost of trading.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a market design for Colombia’s forward energy market, {{which is scheduled}} to began in 2008. The forward energy <b>market</b> is an <b>organized</b> <b>market</b> to procure energy for electricity customers on a forward basis. It includes both the regulated <b>market</b> (residential and <b>other</b> small customers) and the nonregulated market (large customers). Currently, regulated customers represent 68 % of the total electricity demand and nonregulated customers represent the remaining 32 %. The proposed design is novel in that it integrates both the regulated and nonregulated customers into a single <b>organized</b> <b>market.</b> Although the regulated and nonregulated energy products remain distinct, their integration into a single market facilitates arbitrage between the products, improves liquidity, and reduces transaction costs. Both regulated and nonregulated customers benefit from this unified approach. This paper {{presents a}}ll elements of the market design: the product design (see also Cramton 2007), the auction design, and the transition to the new market. Auctions...|$|R

Using detailed data on prices, quantities, and production costs, we examine how market outcomes changed when a large region in the Eastern US rapidly switched from a bilateral system of trade to an auction market design in 2004. Although economic theory yields ambiguous predictions, the empirical evidence indicates that employing an <b>organized</b> <b>market</b> design substantially improved overall market efficiency, and that these efficiency gains far exceeded implementation costs. Our analysis points to the merits of <b>organized</b> <b>market</b> institutions for electricity, a central issue in debates over market-oriented regulatory reforms...|$|R
