40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{inducing}} interpretability in KG embeddings. Specifically, we explore the Universal Schema (Riedel et al., 2013) and propose a method to induce interpretability. There have been many vector space models proposed for the problem, however, most of these methods don't address the interpretability (semantics) of individual dimensions. In this work, we study this problem and propose a method for inducing interpretability in KG embeddings using entity co-occurrence statistics. The proposed method significantly improves the interpretability, while maintaining comparable performance in <b>other</b> <b>KG</b> tasks...|$|E

50|$|As the {{disorder}} becomes more widely known, media reports have increased. French Canadian Isabelle Lanthier appeared on Montel Williams' talk show where she told how her chest grew from 86 cm (34 in) to 133 cm (52.5 in) {{in five months}} during her pregnancy. At their largest, one breast weighed 6.8 kg (15 lb) and the <b>other</b> 5.4 <b>kg</b> (12 lb). Her husband custom-made a special bra to support her breasts. In 2007, a Chilean TV station covered the story of 32-year-old Jasna Galleguillos from Antofagasta, who experienced ongoing back pain, making everyday tasks very difficult to perform. She underwent breast reduction surgery to relieve her pain. Surgeons removed 4.25 kg from one breast and 3.33 <b>kg</b> from the <b>other</b> breast.|$|R

50|$|Inbicon {{established}} their first pilot plant in 2003. The company opened their second pilot plant in 2005. Finally, production start-up was unveiled in December 2009 in Kalundborg, Denmark. This plant contains two hydrothermal pretreatment lines of varying quantities. One line has a maximum capacity of 100 <b>kg</b> and the <b>other</b> 1000 <b>kg</b> of lignocellulosic biomass an hour. In the pilot plant only industrial yeast that ferments C6 sugars is used. This plant with {{the input of}} 30,000 t of wheat straw can produce 5.4 million litres of ethanol a year. The plant also produces 13,100 t of lignin pellets and 11,250 t of C5-molasses. In their initial pilot plant they were using 2.4 tonnes of feedstock per day. The 2005 scale-up pilot plant achieved a ten-fold increase to 24 tonnes per day. Finally in 2009 in the demonstration plant of Kalundborg {{they are capable of}} 100 tonnes per day. Inbicon’s future goal is for a plant that could use 1,200 tonnes of feedstock per day.|$|R

5000|$|The American {{consulate}} attack killed 8 people including 2 {{security service}} personnel. However, no Americans were {{hurt in the}} attack. The perpetrators were armed with guns and grenades and two car bombs. The security barrier was damaged, while shells from rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades were seen in the vicinity. Police {{said one of the}} car bombs exploded at a checkpoint 50 metres from the consulate, while the <b>other</b> 100 <b>kg</b> bomb went off close to the consulate gate. At least three blasts were reported before a firefight between security forces and the attackers followed. According to Pakistan police official Ghulam Hussain, [...] "The target was certainly the American consulate but they didn't succeed in getting there...one of the suicide bombers blew himself up close to the gate. Police guarding the US consulate started retaliatory fire. More blasts took place. We have recovered unexploded material from four different points".

50|$|The most {{lopsided}} {{achievement of}} the M1A1s was the destruction of seven T-72 Lion of Babylon tanks in a point-blank skirmish (less than 50 yd) near Mahmoudiyah, about 18 mi south of Baghdad, with no losses for the American side. However, on October 29, 2003, two soldiers were killed and a third wounded when their tank was disabled by an anti-tank mine, which was combined with <b>other</b> explosives (500 <b>kg,</b> including several 155 mm rounds) to increase its effect. The massive explosion beneath the tank knocked off the turret. This {{marked the first time}} deaths resulted from a hostile-fire assault on the M1 tank from enemy forces.|$|R

Procurement began with a letter contract (cost-plus-fixed-fee) on 17 January 1945 with mockup inspection and approval in early February. Orders for three prototypes followed on 27 February 1945 with certain changes recommended by the board. Serials 45-59582 to 59584 were assigned. Budgetary concerns also led to the contract being changed to a fixed-price type.|$|R
50|$|After G. E. Moore {{resigned}} {{the chair}} in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet {{an official of the}} Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many <b>other</b> assets, 1700 <b>kg</b> of gold. There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher Sophia Janowskaya.|$|R

Marine mammals, in particular seals, thronged the coasts, with evidence of coastal colonies much further north than exist [...] At the Waitaki River mouth, huge numbers of moa bones, estimated at 29,000 to 90,000 birds, have been located. Further south, at the Shag River mouth, at least 6,000 moa were slaughtered by humans over a relatively short period.|$|R

The name was intended to describe specific anatomical differences between members of the genus Choloepus and Bradypus. However, to accurately {{describe the}}se differences, the correct name should be two-fingered sloth (Choloepus spp) as the differences occur in the hands, {{and not in the}} feet.They are also larger than three-toed sloths, having a body length of 58 to 70 cm, and weighing 4 to 8 <b>kg.</b> <b>Other</b> distinguishing features include a more prominent snout, longer fur, and the absence of a tail.|$|R

In treatment combination of 15 cm culm cutting height of culm and 120 kg N ha - 1 was found to produce also the highest grain yield. The highest grain yield (1. 56 t ha - 1) resulted from ratoon crop was 25. 16 % of the primary crop.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the improvement of the national greenhouse gas emission inventory, this work aimed at estimating a country-specific enteric methane (CH 4) emission factor for the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. For this purpose, national agriculture statistics, and information on animal production and farming conditions were analysed, and the emission factor was estimated using the Tier 2 model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Country-specific CH 4 emission factors for buffalo cows (630 kg body weight, BW) and <b>other</b> buffalo (313 <b>kg</b> BW) categories were estimated for the period 1990 – 2004. In 2004, the estimated enteric CH 4 emission factor for the buffalo cows was 73 kg/head per year, whereas that for other buffalo categories it was 56 kg/head per year.

5000|$|Designed by Greg Goodall And Jim Boyer in {{the early}} 1980s the 4.9 meter Taipan was a {{development}} of the Mosquito catamaran, lighter than the Hobie 16, and more similar to the A class in hull design.

Rigged and ready to sail the 4.9 weighs a minimum of 231 lb (105 <b>kg).</b> <b>Other</b> features include a wing mast, and later on a spinnaker. Like the Mosquito and Cobra class rules to sail the boat cat rigged (mainsail & more recently with spinnaker for solo sailing) or sloop rigged (Main, Jib & spinnaker for two up sailing).

500|$|Much of {{the success}} {{achieved}} was down to Richthofen's subordinates, particularly Kampfgeschwader 77 and its commander Oberst Dr. Johann-Volkmar Fisser whose attachment to VIII. Fliegerkorps, was noted by Generalmajor Wilhelm Speidel. He commented it [...] "...was {{the result of the}} well-known tendency of the commanding general to conduct his own private war". Fisser's KG 77 destroyed the AéMI main bases, with help from KG 54. Fighters from Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) eliminated two Belgian squadrons at Neerhespen, and during the afternoon, I./St.G 2 destroyed nine of the 15 Fiat CR.42 fighters at Brusthem. At Schaffen-Diest, three Hawker Hurricanes of Escadrille 2/I/2 were destroyed and another six damaged when a wave of He 111s caught them as they were about to take off. A further two were lost in destroyed hangars. At Nivelles airfield, 13 CR42s were destroyed. The only <b>other</b> success was <b>KG</b> 27s destruction of eight aircraft at Belesle.|$|R
