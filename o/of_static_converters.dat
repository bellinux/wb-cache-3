40|$|The probrem {{in regard}} to driving of a {{monocyclic}} motor is how to choose a <b>static</b> phase <b>converter</b> allowing a satisfactory starting，acceleration and load characteristics.

40|$|The Norwegian {{traction}} power {{system is a}} 15 kV single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power system. The {{traction power}} system is mainly supplied by rotary frequency converters that convert three-phase 50 Hz power from the utility grid to single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power. In recent times, <b>static</b> frequency <b>converters</b> (power electronic converters) have also been introduced. Parts of the traction power system are quite weak; consisting of long, radial lines with high impedance. Since the 1990 s, the introduction of advanced rail vehicles has revealed a poorly damped eigenmode around 1. 6 Hz in the rotary converters used to supply power to the system. In weak parts of the traction power system, the advanced rail vehicles can excite this eigenmode with their fast control systems, creating low frequency voltage oscillations in the traction power system. This thesis presents the work in investigating whether the <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> in the traction power system {{could be used to}} dampen low frequency oscillations and stabilise the traction power system. A central part of the work is the developing a model <b>of</b> a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> in the PSCAD/EMTDC software, including a control system. For the purpose of recreating the low frequency oscillation problem, a rotary converter is also modelled, modifying synchronous machine models in the PSCAD model library. The traction power system is synchronised with the 50 Hz utility grid, so a control algorithm governing the frequency and phase angle <b>of</b> the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is implemented in the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system, to allow both the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> and rotary converter model to maintain synchronism and operate in parallel. An existing advanced rail vehicle model developed in [4] and implemented in PSCAD in [8] is also added, forming a small model of a traction power system. The model <b>of</b> a <b>static</b> <b>converter,</b> rotary converter and advanced rail vehicle are combined to form a test-bench to study the how the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system can be used to mitigate the low frequency oscillation problem. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller is implemented in the <b>static</b> <b>converter's</b> control system and tested. The <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is found to provide extra stability to the traction power system when interconnected with a rotary converter, compared to situations were only rotary converters are present in the system, or worse, when a rotary converter operates in stand-alone mode. Implementation of a POD controller was also found to be effective in adding additional damping to the low frequency oscillations, but also revealed potential negative interaction issues with advanced rail vehicles. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{high cost}} of the Voltage Source Converters (VSC) based FACTS {{controllers}} such as STATCOM, SSSC and UPFC {{is found to be}} the major hindrance to their widespread use. The classical controllers such as SVC and TCSC are important because of their simple construction, ease of use and low installation cost. Over the years, environmental, right-of-way and cost problems have delayed construction of generation facilities as well as new transmission lines. Better utilization of existing power systems and control equipment has thus become imperative. Novel and cost effective FACTS topologies therefore, need to be built upon existing equipment which makes use <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>converters.</b> The control performance of such topologies therefore, needs to be analyzed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} performance <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>converters</b> {{leads to}} more severe operating conditions. Because of the electrical waveforms used or the proximity of heat sources, magnetic components are exposed to high temperatures which can degrade {{the performance of the}} magnetic material. That's why predicting the temperature behaviour of magnetic components is a key step in the conception {{of a new generation of}} converters. In power electronics, nanocrystalline materials are increasingly used because of their low losses with high frequency and their good temperature stability. The aim of our work is to model the magnetic behaviour of a nanocrystalline core with increasing temperature and frequency, in order to implement it in a circuit simulator in the future. Thus the model should be as accurate as possible while remaining simple and fast. Our model is based on the separation of static and dynamic losses. Given the thin static hysteresis of this material, a reversible mathematical function is used as static law. Moreover, in the intended applications, frequencies can be up to 100 MHz. In this context, taking the magnetic diffusion into account is essential. That is why we have implemented a model using a fractional derivation, requiring few parameters and with short computation time.

40|$|Power {{conversion}} {{systems are}} dependent on the performance and reliability <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>converters.</b> However, {{they are subject to}} frequent functional and environmental strains, which can induce failures. The anticipation of these failures is difficult but important so the operation of a system can be halted before a breakdown occurs. In the case of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, the system can be simplified into two distinct blocks: the solar panels/modules and the power inverter. A breakdown in either of these blocks can cause significant downtime in the system. Nevertheless, multiple solar module failures can often be tolerated and not lead to a total breakdown of the entire array, whereas a single component failure in the inverter can lead to a collapse of the entire system. Furthermore, solar panel/module manufacturers often offer warranties of up to 20 years, while warranties for inverters rarely reach the ten-year mark [1]. As such, the overall cost of a PV inverter can increase by a factor of two or three if it undergoes one or two failures during the life of the system. Although the market competition between PV inverter manufacturers has traditionally focused on the efficiency of their product, a failure that induces a downtime of just a few days can easily negate the yield attained through a 1 % efficiency improvement. Oversizing the inverter or introducing redundancy into the inverter system is one option to improve reliability; however, often, this is not economical...|$|E
