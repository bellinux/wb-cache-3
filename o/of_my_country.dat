After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving {{into her own}} room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the Privy Council, she announces that [...] "I mean to devote my life in service <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> and my people". Victoria now moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace and her aunt, Queen Adelaide, advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert then comes to England {{to spend more time}} with Victoria. They bond more, dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor. Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self-sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves.|$|E
500|$|The British {{withdrew from}} Philadelphia, in June 1778, and Washington {{appointed}} Arnold military {{commander of the}} city. [...] Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia, Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there, engaging {{in a variety of}} business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority. Such schemes were not exactly uncommon among American officers, but Arnold's schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians such as Joseph Reed, who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges against him. Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges, writing to Washington in May 1779, [...] "Having become a cripple in the service <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country,</b> I little expected to meet [...] ungrateful returns".|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of these defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir men payset de conserver mon honneur, por écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> and my honour, {{to listen to your}} proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E

500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> and my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

[...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let me tell you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country.</b> I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country."

[...] Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict. The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging. Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has [...] "shocked the collective conscience of India" [...] and that [...] "courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes." [...] The victim's family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, [...] "We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved.

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country,</b> not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|Yichang {{decided to}} organise an {{arranged}} marriage for Mao, selecting {{for him the}} seventeen-year-old Luo Yigu, {{the daughter of a}} local landowner. Although unhappy with the arrangement, Mao agreed to go through with the marriage, with the wedding taking place in 1907 or 1908. According to his later account however, he never consummated the marriage and refused to live with Luo. Instead, he claimed that he made use of connections with his maternal family to leave his parental home and move into the house of an unemployed student in Shaoshan, where he lived for a year. There, he continued his reading, enjoying tales of ancient Chinese rulers such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian and Ban Gu's History of the Former Han Dynasty. He was also influenced by Feng Guifen's Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin, which had been compiled in 1861. Like Guanying's book, it called on China to adopt foreign techniques to strengthen itself, and to use them to defend itself from foreign aggression. Mao also read a pamphlet by the Chinese revolutionary Chen Tianhua, which recounted China's loss of sovereignty to Japanese and European imperialists; [...] Mao claimed that this was a great influence on him, for after reading it [...] "I felt depressed about the future <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country</b> and began to realize that it was the duty of all the people to help save it." [...] Meanwhile, Luo was locally disgraced and eventually died of dysentery in 1910, while Qimei moved to live with her brother's family in her native village of Xiangxiang.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{planned to}} {{withdraw}} from Philadelphia in June 1778 Washington appointed Arnold to take military command of the city after the British retreat. [...] Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia, Arnold began scheming to capitalize financially on the change in power there, engaging {{in a variety of}} business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority. [...] While these schemes were not necessarily illegal, the ethics involved were seen as highly dubious at the time. [...] Some of his schemes were frustrated by the actions of highly partisan Patriots, including the politically powerful Joseph Reed. [...] These business dealings required capital, which Arnold often borrowed. [...] Arnold furthered his debts by living extravagantly, occupying the Penn mansion and throwing parties for high society. [...] Complicating the situation was the fact that Arnold was administratively trapped between the relatively powerful Pennsylvania government and the Congress, which was often forced to bow to the populous state's demands in order to achieve its aims. [...] Reed and others amassed a series of irregularities in Arnold's official actions, and open war of words erupted between Arnold and Reed and his supporters. By February 1779 a variety of charges had been publicly made that he was abusing his power. [...] He demanded a full court martial, writing to Washington in May, [...] "Having become a cripple in the service <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>country,</b> I little expected to meet [...] ungrateful returns". [...] The court martial was postponed (it would not be held until December 1779), once more leaving Arnold frustrated and angry at the Congress for its inaction.|$|E
