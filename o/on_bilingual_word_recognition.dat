40|$|We contrasted {{the effect}} of instruction-induced expectancies and {{language}} intermixing in an English lexical decision task performed by Dutch-English bilinguals. At {{the start of the}} experiment, participants were instructed to respond to interlingual homographs and exclusively English words by giving a "yes" response, and to English nonwords and to exclusively Dutch words by giving a "no" response. In {{the first part of the}} experiment the stimulus list did not contain any Dutch words. In the second part of the experiment, Dutch items were introduced. No significant differences were found between interlingual homographs and controls in the first part of the experiment, while strong inhibition effects were obtained for interlingual homographs in the second part.

40|$|Research <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> {{suggests}} that lexical access is non-selective {{with respect to}} language, i. e., that word representations of both languages become active during recognition. One piece of evidence is that bilinguals recognise cognates (words that are identical or similar in form and meaning in two languages) faster than non-cognates. The present study used cognates to investigate whether the non-selective access hypothesis holds also for trilinguals and three languages. Dutch-English-German trilinguals carried out a lexical decision task in their third language (German). The word materials included purely German control words, “double” cognates that overlapped in Dutch and German, but not in English, and “triple” cognates with the same form and meaning in Dutch, German, and English. Faster RTs were found for Dutch-German cognates than for control words, but additionally, “triple” cognates were processed even faster than “double” cognates. The “triple” cognate effect was not influenced by whether the participants had previously read an English text. A control experiment with German monolinguals confirmed that the effect was not an artifact of uncontrolled stimulus characteristics. Thus, independent of context, both the native language and another foreign non-target language influenced target language comprehension in trilinguals. This supports a view of language non-selective access implying all languages known to an individual may affect word activation and recognition...|$|E
40|$|Until now, {{research}} <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> {{has been}} scarce, and although most studies agree that lexical access is language-nonselective, {{there is less}} consensus {{with respect to the}} influence of potentially constraining factors. The present study investigated the influence of three possible constraints. We tested whether language nonselectivity is restricted by (a) a sentence context in a second language (L 2), (b) the semantic constraint of the sentence, and (c) the native language of the speaker. Dutch-English bilinguals completed an English auditory lexical decision task on the last word of low-and high-constraining sentences. Sentences were pronounced by a native Dutch speaker with English as the L 2, or by a native English speaker with Dutch as the L 2. Interlingual homophones (e. g., lief "sweet" - leaf/lirf/) were always recognized more slowly than control words. The semantic constraint of the sentence and the native accent of the speaker modulated, but did not eliminate interlingual homophone effects.

40|$|Research <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> {{suggests}} that lexical access is nonselective {{with respect to}} language, i. e., that word representations of both languages become active during recognition. One piece of evidence supporting nonselective access is that bilinguals recognize cognates (words that are identical or similar in form and meaning in two or more languages) faster than noncognates. In fact, any difference between how cognates and ‘monolingual’ words are processed by multilinguals would indicate that the other, currently irrelevant language must {{have played a role}} as well, at least as long as the two groups of words are comparable with respect to all dimensions other than language membership. The aim of the present paper is to report on two visual perceptual experiments conducted within the lexical decision task paradigm whose aim was to test the assumptions concerning the special position of cognates (the cognate facilitation effect, cf. Dijkstra, 2005) within a trilingual mind and to answer the question whether trilinguals rely upon their second language lexical knowledge when recognizing L 3 words. The results of the experiments attest to simultaneous activation and parallel processing as well as interaction among all the three languages.

40|$|Many {{studies in}} bilingual visual word {{recognition}} {{have demonstrated that}} lexical access is not language selective. However, research <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in the auditory modality has been scarce, and it has yielded mixed results {{with regard to the}} degree of this language nonselectivity. In the present study, we investigated whether listening to a second language (L 2) is influenced by knowledge of the native language (L 1) and, more important, whether listening to the L 1 is also influenced by knowledge of an L 2. Additionally, we investigated whether the listener's selectivity of lexical access is influenced by the speaker's L 1 (and thus his or her accent). With this aim, Dutch-English bilinguals completed an English (Experiment 1) and a Dutch (Experiment 3) auditory lexical decision task. As a control, the English auditory lexical decision task was also completed by English monolinguals (Experiment 2). Targets were pronounced by a native Dutch speaker with English as the L 2 (Experiments 1 A, 2 A, and 3 A) or by a native English speaker with Dutch as the L 2 (Experiments 1 B, 2 B, and 3 B). In all experiments, Dutch-English bilinguals recognized interlingual homophones (e. g., lief [sweet]-leaf /li:f/) significantly slower than matched control words, whereas the English monolinguals showed no effect. These results indicate that (a) lexical access in bilingual auditory word recognition is not language selective in L 2, nor in L 1, and (b) language-specific subphonological cues do not annul cross-lingual interactions...|$|E

The central aim was to contribute to the debate on differences in orthographic processing between bilinguals and monolinguals, expanding the body of existing research by knowledge <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> mechanisms in beginning readers of German. The two main goals were to (1) study differences in the developmental trajectories of reading between first (L 1) and second (L 2) language speakers, and (2) to investigate {{the development of}} orthographic processing mechanisms that are specific to the bilingual word recognition system. To disentangle developmental effects between dominant and balanced bilinguals, four studies were conducted, of which two focused on children learning to read in German as their L 2, and two examined German-English balanced bilinguals learning to read concurrently in both languages. Study 1 investigated performance differences between L 1 and L 2 speakers in different component processes of reading, while controlling for the impact of linguistic and executive functioning skills. Study 2 zoomed in on the mechanisms of lexical access and compared L 1 and L 2 speakers’ lexical decision performance with regard to the impact of linguistic characteristics throughout elementary school. In study 3, the parallel activation of orthographic as well as semantic representations in both languages of balanced bilingual children was examined by studying the processing of cognates and false friends in German and English.

In such cases, the first item was either an exclusively English (HOUSE) or an exclusively Dutch (ZAAK) word. Semantic priming effects were found in on-line response times. Event-related potentials that were recorded simultaneously showed N 400 priming effects thought to reflect semantic integration processes.

40|$|The {{debate between}} single and dual route {{accounts}} of cognitive processes has been generated predominantly by {{the application of}} connectionist modeling techniques to two areas of psycholinguistics. This paper draws an analogy between this debate and bilingual language processing. A prominent question within <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> is whether the bilingual has functionally separate lexicons for each language, or a single system able to recognize the words in both languages. Empirical evidence has been taken to support a model which includes two separate lexicons working in parallel (Smith, 1991; Gerard and Scarborough, 1989). However, a range of interference effects has been found between the bilingual’s two sets of lexical knowledge (Thomas, 1997 a). Connectionist models have been put forward which suggest that a single representational resource may deal with these data, so long as words are coded according to language membership (Thomas, 1997 a, 1997 b, Dijkstra and van Heuven, 1998). This paper discusses the criteria which {{might be used to}} differentiate single route and dual route models.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies has demonstrated that learning {{to read and write}} influences the way spoken language is processed.

In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a working model of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> is developed, which is able to explain orthographic and phonological interactions during L 2 word processing. The architecture of the working model is based on previous outcomes of research on auditory and visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> as well as current findings on orthographic influences during spoken auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> In the second part of the thesis, the working model is tested in three psycholinguistic experiments on auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> (rhyme judgement, phoneme deletion and lexical decision). Special emphasis of the investigation lies on a cross-linguistic comparison between native and non-native speakers of English as well as between two groups of non-native speakers of English with different orthographic backgrounds, i. e. a shallow orthography (German) and a deep orthography (Danish). The results of the experiments show that orthographic information is activated during L 2 auditory word processing.

Little is known about the bilingual processing of Russian and English, but studies indicate that the partially distinct character of the Russian and English scripts does not prevent co-activation (Jouravlev and Jared, 2014; Marian and Spivey, 2003; Kaushanskaya and Marian, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of bilingualism research on visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in isolation and in sentence context.

Recent studies suggest that the language of the preceding words is insufficient to restrict lexical access to words of the target language, even when reading in the native language.

40|$|In a {{semantic}} priming study, we investigated {{the processing of}} German–English homographs such as gift (German = “poison”, English = “present”) in sentence contexts using a joint reaction time (RT) /event-related brain potential (ERP) measure. Native German speakers with intermediate or advanced knowledge of English (N = 48) performed an all-L 2 (English) experiment where sentences such as “The woman gave her friend an expensive gift” (control prime: item) were presented, followed by targets (i. e., boss) for lexical decision. To test the role of global task effects during sentence processing, we presented half the participants (N = 24) with a 20 -min silent film narrated in German and half (N = 24) with the film in English before the experiment. To address the development of task effects over time, we analyzed {{the first and second}} blocks of the experiment. The results showed a significant interaction between semantic priming, movie version, and block in both the RTs and ERPs: there was significant semantic priming in the RTs and modulations in the N 200 and N 400 components only for participants who viewed the German movie, and only during the first block. Results suggest that in an all-L 2 sentence task with L 2 pre-task priming (English film), decision thresholds are raised high enough to eliminate measurable influence of the L 1 on the L 2. Despite identical material, participants who viewed the German film had to adjust, or zoom in, to the all-L 2 task.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explored {{different aspects}} of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> First, <b>bilingual</b> auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> was examined using interlingual homophones in a cross-modal priming task. Bilinguals were found to activate word candidates in both languages, but were also sensitive to sublexical differences between cross-linguistically phonologically similar words (e. g., LIEF, Dutch, and LEAF, English). Second, the development of cognitive control and automatisation with increasing proficiency was examined in a lexical decision study. Unexpectedly, cognitive control did not vary much with language proficiency. When items of the native language {{were present in the}} experiment, different proficiency groups were unable to exclude interference by that language. Proficiency differences were only reflected in slower reactions and more errors in less proficient bilinguals. Automatisation was operationalized using the Coefficient of Variability (CV) by Segalowitz, defined as the mean standard deviation of a participant's RTs divided by the mean RT. However, the observed pattern of CV was not in accordance with Segalowitz's predictions. The only observed differences in automatisation across proficiency groups were in terms of speed and error rates. Third, the effects of the second language on the mother tongue were examined using masked priming with interlingual neighbors. A brief (unconscious) presentation of the prime 'large' slowed down the <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> response on the following target word 'LARVE', compared to an orthographically unrelated prime.

Identical cognates showed a large discontinuous processing advantage and were subject to facilitation from phonological similarity. In language decision, the effect of orthographic similarity reversed: a cognate inhibition effect arose, the size of which increased with orthographic similarity. Here identical cognates were markedly slower than other cognates. In progressive demasking, no orthographic similarity effect was found for non-identical cognates, but a semantic similarity effect arose.

Reaction times for native language words were not influenced by neighborhood density or frequency but error rates showed cross-lingual neighborhood effects depending on target word frequency. The large-scale eye movement corpus confirmed effects of cross-lingual neighborhood on natural reading, even though participants were reading a novel in a unilingual context.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} investigated how cross-linguistic {{overlap in}} semantics, orthography, and phonology affects <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in different variants of the lexical decision task. Dutch-English bilinguals performed a language-specific or a generalized lexical decision task including {{words that are}} spelled and / or pronounced the same in English and Dutch and that matched one-language control words from both languages. In Experiments 1 and 3, 'false friends' were presented with different meanings in the two languages (e. g., SPOT), while Experiments 2 and 4 contained 'cognates' with the same meanings (e. g., FILM) across languages. The language-specific Experiments 1 and 2 replicated and qualified an earlier study (Dijkstra, Grainger, & Van Heuven, 1999). In the generalized Experiment 3, participants reacted equally fast on Dutch-English homographs and Dutch control words, indicating that their response was primarily based on the fastest available orthographic code (Dutch). In Experiment 4, cognates were recognized faster than English and Dutch controls, suggesting co-activation of the cognates' semantics.

2500|$|The fourth {{track and}} first single off the album, [...] "T.W.L", {{is a high}} paced pop song that is carried by a horn section. The lyrics heavily rely <b>on</b> <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> puns, such as, [...] " [...] Akete meeting you/Hiraku to be loved [...] " [...] which, when sung, sound like [...] " [...] Akete mite yo/Hiraku tobira (Try opening it/Open the doors)". The fifth track, [...] " [...] Fly High [...] ", is a similar up beat song, and is {{followed}} by the album's sixth track and third single, [...] "365 Nichi Kazoku", a slow ballad that initially starts off slow but steadily increases as more instruments are added to the overall composition.|$|R
40|$|Most bilinguals {{understand}} their second language {{more slowly than}} their first. This behavioral asymmetry may arise from the perceptual, phonological, lexicosemantic, or strategic components of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> processing. However, {{little is known about}} the neural source of such language dominance and how it is regulated in the bilingual brain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that unconscious neural priming in <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> is language nonselective in the left midfusiform gyrus but exhibits a preference for the dominant language in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG). These early-stage components of reading were located slightly upstream of the left midlateral MTG, which exhibited enhanced response during a conscious switch of language. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that this language switch is triggered by reentrant signals from inferior frontal cortex and not by bottom-up signals from occipitotemporal cortex. We further confirmed that magnetic stimulation of the same inferior frontal region interferes with conscious language control but does not disrupt unconscious priming by masked words. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the neural bottleneck in the bilingual brain is a cross-language asymmetry of form-meaning association in inferolateral temporal cortex, which is overcome by a top-down cognitive control for implementing a task schema in each language...|$|R
40|$|Does {{language}}-specific orthography help language {{detection and}} lexical access in naturalistic bilingual contexts? This study investigates how L 2 orthotactic properties influence bilingual language detection in bilingual societies {{and the extent}} to which it modulates lexical access and single word processing. Language specificity of naturalistically learnt L 2 words was manipulated by including bigram combinations that could be either L 2 language-specific or common in the two languages known by bilinguals. A group of balanced bilinguals and a group of highly proficient but unbalanced bilinguals who grew up in a bilingual society were tested, together with a group of monolinguals (for control purposes). All the participants completed a speeded language detection task and a progressive demasking task. Results showed that the use of the information of orthotactic rules across languages depends on the task demands at hand, and on participants' proficiency in the second language. The influence of language orthotactic rules during language detection, lexical access and word identification are discussed according to the most prominent models of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition...</b>|$|R
