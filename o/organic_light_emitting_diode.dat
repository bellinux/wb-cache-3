Small molecule OLEDs (SM-OLEDs) include organometallic chelates(Alq3), fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes, and conjugated dendrimers.

By modifying the structure of Br6A, scientists are attempting to achieve a next generation <b>organic</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode.</b> Devices based on small molecules are usually fabricated by thermal evaporation under vacuum.
