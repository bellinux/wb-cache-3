40|$|This paper {{describes}} changes occurring on {{the skin}} surface following wetting and during the development <b>of</b> <b>fleece</b> rot and examines the effect <b>of</b> some <b>fleece</b> characters on these changes. One day of wetting reduced the average thickness of the skin wax layer from 7. 82 to 4. 90 ¦m, {{but there was little}} change In the proportion of the skin surface covered by wax. When hyperaemia of the skin was first noted the proportion of the skin surface covered by wax had decreased from 97. 8 to 47. 5 % and the average thickness of skin wax had decreased to 3. 64 ¦m. Cholesterol content of the skin wax increased steadily from the first day <b>of</b> wetting as <b>fleece</b> rot developed, whereas lanosterol content increased only in the early stages <b>of</b> <b>fleece</b> rot. Suint content <b>of</b> the <b>fleece,</b> measured before wetting commenced, was positively correlated with fleece rot score at all times during wetting. Suint also showed significant correlations with moisture content of the proximal portion of the staple, percentage of the skin surface covered by wax and cholesterol and lanosterol content of the wax. No relationship was observed between fleece rot score and fleece wax content, wettability, staple formation, tip formation, crimp definition or initial thickness of the skin wax layer...|$|R

40|$|Author for Correspondence One of {{the quality}} {{characteristics}} that is most appreciated in animal fibres is the skin comfort effect that an article made of this fibre has on the skin {{and the number of}} fibre tips that are exposed to the skin gives this comfort (or lack thereof).

Studies on genetic mechanisms for Llama-Alpaca fleece traits show that the white phenotype is dominant to the pigmented phenotype and to the spotted phenotype, black face and extremities phenotypes, are dominant to black and wild phenotypes.
