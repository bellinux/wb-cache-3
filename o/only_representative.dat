This was the last State-of-Origin match, although a Victoria team {{was selected to}} play against a Dream Team in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008—White was selected in the initial 40-man squad for Victoria, but once again did not make the final 22. He was Melbourne's <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> in the squad. Playing for Victoria in 1998 was his <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> appearance.|$|E

5|$|T. ludovicianus is {{traditionally}} placed {{within its own}} genus as its <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> of North America, but recent DNA work suggests it is closely allied with the Bewick's wren. A distinct population in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species, either known as Cabot's wren or white-browed wren (Thryothorus albinucha). It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors, however.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Europe, Central and North America, temperate Asia, and Turkey. In North America, its range extends from Canada to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt south of Mexico City. The mushroom is common, {{appearing in the}} summer and autumn, although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration. A.vulgare is the <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> of its genus in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} {{is found}} throughout the inshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico (where it is the <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> of its family) and the Caribbean Sea, including Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles to Trinidad.

Off Mexico, this species occupies a salinity range of 26–40ppt.|$|E

5|$|Having {{previously}} represented Germany at U18 level, Holtby {{made his}} debut for the U19's in September 2008 and earned 12 caps overall. He scored {{the first of}} his four international goals for the German U19 team on 11 October 2008, netting in a 5–0 victory over Lithuania. The following year, Germany youth coach Horst Hrubesch named Holtby in his squad for the U20 World Cup in Egypt. Holtby scored two goals at the tournament, one of which was against eventual runners-up Brazil in the quarter-finals. In 2013, he captained Germany at the European Under-21 Championship in Israel and was named in as the nation's <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver}} medal at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two {{opportunities}} to draw Spain level but found herself {{the victim of a}} waterlogged pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of the}} on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely waterlogged. García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received overwhelming support from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood behind her and the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. The record is one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E
5|$|Verity's final {{first-class}} cricket {{came in the}} 1939 season {{which was}} overshadowed by the forthcoming war. Yorkshire won their third successive County Championship and the seventh of Verity's career. Verity took 191wickets {{at an average of}} 13.13, to top the bowling averages {{for the second time in}} his career. Verity's <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> cricket came in the first Test match against West Indies, when he took two wickets in the match. He was subsequently left out of the team for the second Test in favour of Tom Goddard, and did not play any more Test matches. However, Wisden's report on the third Test commented that his absence and that of several other bowlers left the English attack weaker. In a career total of 40Tests, Verity took 144wickets at an average of 24.37 and scored 669runs at an average of 20.90. With much of the end of the cricket season abandoned prior to the expected outbreak of war, Verity played his last match against Sussex. In the second innings, Verity took seven wickets for nine runs on a rain-affected pitch to bowl Sussex out for 33 and take Yorkshire to a win, although the match was played in a strained, tense atmosphere. This was Verity's last performance in first-class cricket. In total, he had taken 1,956wickets at an average of 14.90 and scored 5,603runs at 18.07.|$|E

5|$|Yardley was {{unavailable}} to captain the MCC tour of South Africa {{in the winter}} of 1948–49, which was led by George Mann. Mann did well enough to retain the position for two Tests in the 1949 season; Freddie Brown captained the other two and Yardley did not play for England that year. In all first-class matches that season, he scored 1,612 runs at an average of 37.48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33.86. He did not score a century in the County Championship, but passed three figures for Yorkshire against the New Zealand touring team and for the North against the South in a festival match. His <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> game outside of festival matches was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's; Mann was appointed captain for the game. That season, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, the only time Yorkshire won the competition during Yardley's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire {{finished}} second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the 1951 season and second to Surrey in the 1952 season. However, in following season, Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth, their worst ever finish at that time. In the following two seasons, the team were again runners up, Surrey winning on both occasions. Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season, but only managed two more centuries. These were 183 not out against Hampshire in 1951, the highest innings of his career, and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season. His batting average was generally between 24 and 31, except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36.53. Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952, delivering more overs than any other time in his career in the latter year. He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season, his highest two season totals, and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions, having only done so twice before. However, he bowled less often during his final three seasons, with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets. His <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> cricket, apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce's XI, was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the <b>only</b> <b>representative</b> to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E
