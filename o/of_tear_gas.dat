5|$|Many types <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> {{and other}} riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, but around 15 different types <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets {{slammed into the}} base, leveling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off {{an explosion in the}} main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas,</b> which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, Churchill sanctioned the use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> on Kurdish tribesmen in Iraq. Though the British did {{consider}} {{the use of}} non-lethal poison gas in putting down Kurdish rebellions, it was not used, as conventional bombing was considered effective.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 2007, Danish police {{admitted}} to having mistakenly used a potentially lethal form <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas.</b> The gas, known as Ferret 40, was used against crowds during the riots following the demolition, although the launching mechanism is designed to penetrate doors and walls.|$|E

25|$|During the gun battle, a fire erupted {{inside the}} residence. The {{cause of the}} fire is officially unknown, {{although}} police sources speculated that an errant round ignited one of the suspects' Molotov cocktails. Others suspect that the repeated use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> grenades, which function by burning chemicals at high temperatures, started the structure fire. All six of the suspects suffered multiple gunshot wounds and perished in the ensuing blaze.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that night}} {{in other parts of}} the city, {{including}} the areas near the headquarters of MSZP and the HQ of the public radio station, violence broke out again. Large numbers of riot troops were deployed along with mounted police and K-9 units, acting more systematically than before. The use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> and water cannons with accompanying mounted assaults prevented another building siege. Other police units applied police batons and body force.|$|E

50|$|In July 2000 twelve {{people died}} {{following}} a stampede, {{when they were}} crushed, at a World Cup qualifying match between Zimbabwe and South Africa in Harare. Police fired <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After Delron Buckley scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> into the 60,000 crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects <b>of</b> the <b>tear</b> <b>gas.</b> The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects <b>of</b> the <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing <b>tear</b> <b>gas,</b> calling it a total over-reaction. In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in Bulawayo. Seven police officers were injured and five vehicles badly damaged.|$|R
25|$|Turkey has {{a history}} of police brutality, {{including}} (particularly between 1977 and 2002) the use of torture. Police brutality featuring excessive use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters), pepper spray and water cannon as well as physical violence against protesters has been seen, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and May Day demonstrations. The 2013 protests in Turkey were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of Taksim Gezi Park.|$|E
25|$|The Santa Fe riot was a {{confrontation}} at a Japanese internment camp near Santa Fe, New Mexico, during World War II. On March 12, 1945, approximately 275 internees assembled in Camp Santa Fe {{to watch and}} protest the removal of three men to another camp. During which, a scuffle broke out between the internees and the Border Patrol agents who were guarding the facility, resulting in the use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> grenades, batons, and the serious injury of four internees.|$|E
25|$|The heavy-handed policing, {{including}} the use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> on peaceful protesters, inspired {{tens of thousands of}} citizens to join the protests in Admiralty that night. Containment errors by the police– the closure of Tamar Park and Admiralty Station– caused a spill-over {{to other parts of the}} city, including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. 3,000 protesters occupied a road in Mong Kok and 1,000 went to Causeway Bay. The total number of protesters on the streets swelled to 80,000, at times considerably exceeding 100,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{level and}} {{severity}} of police brutality in Greece {{over the last few}} years has been quite alarming and surprising. Due to recent financial crisis many austerity measures have been put in place, meaning that many individuals and families are struggling to survive. Greek citizens have opposed these austerity measures from the beginning, showing their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has increased significantly, with consistent reports on the use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas,</b> severe injuries inflicted by police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.|$|E
25|$|The {{post office}} was a {{different}} situation. Because it was a federal building, the RCMP led the assault, {{and the leader of}} these protesters, Steve Brodie, was reputed for his infectious militancy. The men responded to the first round <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> by smashing the windows for ventilation and arming themselves with whatever projectiles they could find. The RCMP entered the building and forcibly ejected the men, who were subjected to a cordon of police armed with batons upon leaving the building. City police outside assisted the Mounties. Of the 42 hospitalized, only five were police and all of those were Vancouver police constables.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{protests in}} Istanbul on 28 May 2013 {{were led by}} about 50 environmentalists against {{replacing}} Taksim Gezi Park with a reconstruction of the Ottoman Era Taksim Military Barracks (the scene of pro Sultan riots in 1909). The current protests developed into riots after the heavy handed police intervention which featured significant use <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> and water cannons. The oppressive reaction to the protests caused the protests to widen with many more people to become involved, people from many different walks of life including {{a wide range of}} political interest groups, secular and religious people, students, gays, feminists, football fans, women in head scarves, whole families, all finding reason to join the protests.|$|E

The event, which gathered several thousand, was announced as non-violent, but was met with heavy opposition from the police who arrested 436 people and threw large amounts <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas.</b> Recognizing that the event, which had received heavy public attention, had been carried out with peaceful means, on October 11 Ritt Bjerregaard—the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen—invited spokesmen from Ungdomshuset to have negotiations concerning a peaceful solution to the conflict.|$|E
25|$|The police {{issued an}} initial warning for the protesters to disperse, before using water cannons {{to fire a}} diluted tear gas mixture into the crowd. The tear gas mixture was {{allegedly}} diluted below the standard ratio owing {{to the presence of}} the elderly and the young at the protest. Nevertheless, protesters would deem the tear gas tactic an inhumane use of police force soon after the event. In a statement, the Korean Federation Medical Activist Groups for Health Rights (보건의료단체연합) criticized the used <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> liquid. The police were also publicly criticized for leaving behind tear gas {{at the site of the}} event, owing to the methylene chloride and CS gas that is harmful to humans.|$|E
25|$|As of 15 March 2013, the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011 and {{its aftermath}} resulted in 122 deaths. The number of injuries is hard to determine due to government clamp-down on hospitals and medical personnel. The last accurate estimate for injuries is back to 16 March 2011 and sits at about 2708. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that many detainees were subjected to torture {{and other forms of}} physical and psychological abuse while in custody, five of whom returned dead bodies.
