5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E

50|$|The {{intensity}} of political education has varied {{depending on the}} political climate and {{the target of the}} education. The most intrusive and thorough is “thought reform,” variously referred to as “reeducation” or “transformation.” Thought reform often takes place in a tightly controlled environment such as a prison or labor camp, and may involve threats or other coercive measures to convince the target to reshape his <b>or</b> her <b>ideological</b> <b>or</b> political identity.

25|$|Gramsci's thought {{emanates from}} the {{organized}} left, {{but he has}} also become an important figure in current academic discussions within cultural studies and critical theory.

His influence is particularly strong in contemporary political science (see Neo-gramscianism). His work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly popular culture studies in which many have found the potential for political <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> resistance to dominant government and business interests.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{mobilization}} {{of ethnic groups}} can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians would not even attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> appeals.

Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could be tempted to mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states. Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted {{at the expense of other}} ethnicities.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} {{indigenous}} children, by which mixed-race children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent {{were removed from}} their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, was a policy actively conducted in the period between approximately 1905 and 1969.

Such interpretations of Aboriginal history are disputed by a few historians such as Keith Windschuttle as being exaggerated or fabricated for political <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> reasons.

The Task Force came close to falling apart came later on during a crucial period when Lowe was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. He had a pacemaker implanted, and his absence meant Task Force discussions broke down almost immediately. But a quick recovery was made, both for Lowe and the Task Force. The Task Force reached an agreement and presented its plan for desegregating Dallas public schools to Judge Taylor. The plan was accepted essentially as written.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabia is {{a glaring}} example of {{religious}} apartheid. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media {{are restricted to}} the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jews and other believers are all banned.

25|$|A {{protocol}} {{suggested by}} Mercer and Pignotti uses a taxonomy intended to classify on both research quality and other criteria. In this protocol, evidence-based interventions are those supported by work with randomized designs employing comparisons to established treatments, independent replications of results, blind evaluation of outcomes, {{and the existence}} of a manual. Evidence-supported interventions are those supported by nonrandomized designs, including within-subjects designs, and meeting the criteria for the previous category. Evidence-informed treatments involve case studies or interventions tested on populations other than the targeted group, without independent replications; a manual exists, and {{there is no evidence of}} harm or potential for harm. Belief-based interventions have no published research reports or reports based on composite cases; they may be based on religious <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> principles or may claim a basis in accepted theory without an acceptable rationale; there may or may not be a manual, and there is no evidence of harm or potential for harm. Finally, the category of potentially harmful treatments includes interventions such that harmful mental or physical effects have been documented, or a manual or other source shows the potential for harm.|$|E
500|$|The initial albums were {{generally}} straightforward good versus evil adventure stories. However, thanks to Pierre Christin's interests in politics, sociology and ethnology, as the series progressed the situations typically arose from misunderstandings <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> differences between various groups {{that could be}} resolved through reason and perseverance. The core theme of the stories is an optimistic liberal humanism: the adventures are not about defeating enemies but about exploring, facing challenges, and celebrating diversity. Thus, according to academic John Dean, Christin [...] "as a rule works into his narratives political, environmental and feminist concerns – thereby showing social ills are universal, no matter on what planet you land".|$|E

500|$|According to Semyon Gluzman, {{abuse of}} {{psychiatry}} to suppress dissent {{is based on}} condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state. Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence. Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian. Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> dissent, on the other hand. In {{the conditions of the}} totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness.

500|$|A 1977 paper titled Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups, by Myra T. Johnson, is {{explicitly}} devoted to asexuality in humans. Johnson defines asexuals as those {{men and women}} [...] "who, regardless of physical or emotional condition, actual sexual history, and marital status <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> orientation, seem to prefer {{not to engage in}} sexual activity." [...] She contrasts autoerotic women with asexual women: [...] "The asexual woman... has no sexual desires at all [...] the autoerotic woman... recognizes such desires but prefers to satisfy them alone." [...] Johnson's evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women's magazines written by asexual/autoerotic women. She portrays them as invisible, [...] "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," [...] and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement. Johnson argued that society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons, neurotic, or asexual for political reasons.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "national legions" [...] were {{attached}} to the Waffen-SS, and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland, authorised by Hitler {{at the end of}} 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the Freikorps Danemark, Legion Niederlande and Legion Norwegen, supplemented by transfers from SS-Division Wiking, new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion Flandern was broken up and used as replacements in a number of Waffen-SS formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the [...] "national legion" [...] recruits were motivated by [...] "political <b>or</b> <b>ideological</b> idealism", but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no illusions about the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the [...] "anti-communist" [...] cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the Waffen-SS. However, by mid-1942 onwards, the Waffen-SS faced increasing difficulties with these [...] "Germanic" [...] recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into [...] "pan-Germanic" [...] formations such as SS-Division Wiking. For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.|$|E
