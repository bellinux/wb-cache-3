500|$|The {{band has}} also had a notable impact on music in the Spanish-speaking world. In 1997, a Clash tribute album {{featuring}} performances by Buenos Aires punk bands was released. Many rock en español bands such as Todos Tus Muertos, Café Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Los Prisioneros, Tijuana No, and Attaque 77 are indebted to the Clash. Argentina's Los Fabulosos Cadillacs covered [...] "Should stay <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> go!", London Callings [...] "Revolution Rock" [...] and [...] "The Guns of Brixton" [...] and invited Mick Jones to sing on their song [...] "Mal Bicho". The Clash's influence is similarly reflected in Paris-founded Mano Negra's politicised lyrics and fusion of musical styles.|$|E
500|$|... "Live While We're Young" [...] {{is a song}} by English-Irish boy band One Direction, {{released}} as the lead single from their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012). Written by Savan Kotecha and its producers, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, the number was released by Syco Records on 28 September 2012. Falk, Kotecha, and Yacoub had collaboratively helmed One Direction's previous hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing". The track is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which features rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge, and is backed by wordless chants. Its opening guitar riff bears similarities with The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should I Stay <b>or</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Go".|$|E

500|$|... "Live While We're Young" [...] is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which {{features}} rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers, {{reminiscent of the}} musical structures of their debut album. The opening guitar riff has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash song [...] "Should I Stay <b>or</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Go" [...] (1982). According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. Sam Lansky of Idolator noted that the song is musically similar to their breakthrough hit [...] "What Makes You Beautiful". In contrast to One Direction's previous singles, the lead vocals are predominantly sung by Zayn Malik.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis, a music journalist, {{interpreted}} its signature {{sound as}} a [...] "peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars," [...] which, he said, {{is at least}} an improvement on the substitute R [...] "that was once the grim lot of the boyband." [...] The opening guitar riff of [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should I Stay <b>or</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Go", by some critics. According to Petridis, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. [...] "Rock Me" [...] has a clapping, mid-tempo beat that has been likened to that [...] "We Will Rock You", a 1977 single by Queen.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say, she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had {{to have some sort}} of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 March, Diamandis {{unveiled}} the album artwork {{for the standard}} version of Electra Heart, which depicts a blonde Diamandis wearing several hair rollers.

Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its [...] "retro film stock look" [...] and opined that it [...] "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track [...] "Homewrecker" [...] when stating that she [...] "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (<b>Or</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say Suzy Homewrecker?)" [...] The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple. The track listing for the standard version was confirmed on 1 March, while the track listing for the deluxe version was announced on 5 March. A limited edition box set of Electra Heart contained the deluxe version of the record, four photo art cards, a ring, perspex, necklace, and pocket mirror.|$|E

In Rolling Stones 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, London Calling ranked number 8, the highest entry by a punk band. The Clash was number 77 and Sandinista! was number 404.

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the look she gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] {{four out}} of five stars and wrote, [...] "it's little {{different}} from what we've heard before [...] but when you're the world's biggest boyband, it's no bad thing." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times summarised it as a [...] "characteristically peppy piece of high-gloss party pop." [...] Lansky praised its effectiveness and thought it was [...] "perfectly tailored to top the charts." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust acknowledged that [...] "the song is smart to swipe the guitar-only opening pattern from The Clash's [...] "Should I Stay <b>or</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Go?"—akin to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] lifting the [...] "Summer Nights" [...] beginning—calling on pop history to get you excited for the song before you even really realise why." [...] Unterberger further highlighted the small lyrical plays for conveying [...] "an incredible amount of urgency and fun without much clunky verbage , making singing along something of an inevitability." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post asserted that the song delivers for fans of their debut album: [...] "a poppy, energetic, happy-go-lucky track." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981, {{the band}} {{came out with}} a single, [...] "This Is Radio Clash", that further {{demonstrated}} their ability to mix diverse influences such as dub and hip hop. They set to work on their fifth album in September, originally planning it as a 2-LP set with the title Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg. Jones produced one cut, but the other members were dissatisfied. Production duties were handed to Glyn Johns, and the album was reconceived as a single LP, and released as Combat Rock in May 1982. Though filled with offbeat songs, experiments with sound collage, and a spoken word vocal by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, it contained two [...] "radio friendly" [...] tracks. The leadoff single in the US was [...] "Should I Stay <b>or</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> Go", released in June 1982. Another Jones feature in a rock and roll style similar to [...] "Train in Vain", it received heavy airplay on AOR stations. The follow-up, [...] "Rock the Casbah", put lyrics addressing the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music to a bouncy dance rhythm. (The singles were released in the opposite order in the UK, where they were both preceded by [...] "Know Your Rights".) The music for [...] "Rock the Casbah" [...] was composed by Headon, who performed not only the percussion but also the piano and bass heard on the recorded version. It was the band's biggest US hit ever, charting at number 8, and the video was put into heavy rotation by MTV. The album itself was the band's most successful, hitting number 2 in the UK and number 7 in the US.|$|E
