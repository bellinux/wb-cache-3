Other types of polyethylene and PVC can also be used. Many films have about 500% stretch at break but are only stretched to about 100 - 300% in use.

50|$|In industry, 1-octene is {{commonly}} manufactured by two main routes: oligomerization of ethylene and by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis followed by purification. Another route to 1-octene {{that has been}} used commercially on a small scale is dehydration of alcohols. Prior to the 1970s, 1-octene was also manufactured by thermal cracking of waxes, whereas linear internal <b>octenes</b> were also manufactured by chlorination/dehydrochlorination of linear paraffins.|$|R
50|$|Linear low-density {{polyethylene}} (LLDPE) is a substantially linear polymer (polyethylene), with {{significant numbers of}} short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with longer-chain olefins. Linear {{low-density polyethylene}} differs structurally from conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) because {{of the absence of}} long chain branching. The linearity of LLDPE results from the different manufacturing processes of LLDPE and LDPE. In general, LLDPE is produced at lower temperatures and pressures by copolymerization of ethylene and such higher alpha-olefins as butene, hexene, or <b>octene.</b> The copolymerization process produces an LLDPE polymer that has a narrower molecular weight distribution than conventional LDPE and in combination with the linear structure, significantly different rheological properties.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of LLDPE is initiated by transition metal catalysts, particularly Ziegler or Philips type of catalyst. The actual polymerization {{process can be}} done either in solution phase or in gas phase reactors. Usually, <b>octene</b> is the comonomer in solution phase while butene and hexene are copolymerized with ethylene in a gas phase reactor. LLDPE has higher tensile strength and higher than impact and puncture resistance than does LDPE. It is very flexible and elongates under stress. It {{can be used to}} make thinner films, with better environmental stress cracking resistance. It has good resistance to chemicals. It has good electrical properties. However, it is not as easy to process as LDPE, has lower gloss, and narrower range for heat sealing.|$|E
50|$|Molar mass {{determination}} of copolymers {{is a much}} more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or <b>octene)</b> require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.|$|E

Factors affecting these rearrangements and their utility in synthesis are described. The construction of annulated cyclopentene carboxylates of type 3 by pyrolyses of vinylcyclopropanes 2 has been established as an efficient method of carbocyclic syntheses, most notably {{in the preparation of}} various triquinane sesquiterpenes 2, where the cyclopentene carboxylate unit in 3 served as an element of stereochemical control for the peripheral substituent.

40|$|The hydroformylation of olefins, which {{produces}} linear and branched aldehydes, {{is one of}} the most important industrially applied homogeneously catalysed processes. From the fine chemistry viewpoint, the branched aldehydes are more important as they provide valuable intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry. Concerning aliphatic olefins linear aldehydes are the desired products because of better physical properties of the corresponding plasticizer alcohols. Therefore control of regioselectivity is the essential aspect in hydroformylation research. Moreover, one of the major challenges in homogenous catalysis is the separation of catalyst from the product. In the centre of interest of this thesis were the synthesis of monocyclic phosphite ligands for the n-selective hydroformylation of <b>octenes</b> and investigations on the recycling of the catalyst using two-phase systems and temperature-dependent solvent systems and ligands based on polyethylene glycols. The synthesis of monocyclic phosphites and their use in the hydroformylation of <b>octenes</b> allowed conclusions on the influence of the ligand backbone on activity and selectivity.

Thus the system {{can be considered as}} two different catalysts: i) the oxidised phases at temperatures < 450 °C, Fe 2 (MoO 4) 3 -MoO 3, which is associated with the production of <b>octene</b> and COx, and ii) as the reduced phases at temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene-octene {{copolymers}} (EOCs) {{with two}} different <b>octene</b> contents (20 and 35 wt%) {{and the same}} melt flow index (3 g per 10 min) were cross-linked using various levels (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7 wt%) of dicumyl peroxide at different temperatures. Cross-linking and degradation were analyzed by rubber process analyzer (RPA) within a temperature range of 150 - 200 °C. The highest s′ max (maximum elastic torque) and the lowest tan(delta) were found for EOC- 20 with low-octene content at all cross-linking temperatures. Lower peroxide efficiency was observed {{in the case of}} the high-octene copolymer. Increased degradation was observed with increasing cross-linking temperature. High-octene EOC was found to be more vulnerable to degradation. According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the storage modulus (M′) and the glass transition temperature (T g) obtained from the tan(delta) peaks were found to decrease with increasing <b>octene</b> content. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results show that the <b>octene</b> content has an inverse effect on the crystallinity (X) and melting point (T m) - due to the reduction in the average number of consecutive ethylene units. Creep testing at 150 °C confirmed the cross-linkability results obtained by RPA and the gel content analyses. Increased β-scission due to high numbers of tertiary carbon atoms present in the chain has resulted in the poorer cross-linking and inferior properties of high-octene EOC. © 2013 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Non-toxic DAlCs, {{especially}} lighter dimethyl- and diethyl-carbonate, {{are regarded}} as very green alkylating reagents, particularly when coupled with metal-exchanged Y- and X-faujasites as catalysts. These reactions are selective, free from wastes or byproducts, and often require no additional solvent other than the carbonate. Nonetheless, this paper demonstrates that the operating temperature {{and the nature of}} the faujasite must be carefully chosen in order to avoid DAlC decomposition. In fact, at temperatures ranging from 150 to 240 ◦ C, faujasites can promote decarboxylation of light DAlCs to the corresponding ethers CH 3 OCH 3 and CH 3 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 3 plus CO 2. Heavier DAlCs (dipropyl- and dioctyl-carbonate) undergo a similar decomposition pathway, followed by further reactions to the corresponding alcohols (n-propanol and n-octanol) and alkenes [propylene and <b>octene(s)</b> ]. These transformations not only consume DAlCs, but also give rise to dangerously ﬂammable ethers, as well as undesirable alcohols, alkenes and CO 2. The present work reports an original investigation of the decarboxylation of DAlCs on faujasites with the aim of providing operative boundaries to the experimental conditions to minimise unwanted decomposition. The reaction is strongly affected by the nature of the catalyst: the more basic zeolites, NaX and CsY, are by far more active systems than NaY and LiY. However, solid K 2 CO 3 proves to be rather inefﬁcient. The temperature also plays a crucial role: for example, the onset of the decarboxylation of DMC requires a temperature of ~ 30 ◦ C lower than that for DEC and DPrC. Overall, awareness that certain zeolites cause decomposition of DAlCs under conditions similar to the ones used for DAlC-promoted alkylations allows determination of the correct experimental boundaries for a safer and more productive use of DAlCs as alkylating agent...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} [MoO 2 (acac′) 2] [acac′ = acetylacetonato-type ligand: dibenzoylmethane (3), 1 -benzoylacetone (4), bis(p-methoxybenzoyl) methane (5), 2 -acetylcyclopentanone (6), 2 -acetylcyclohexanone (7), and 2 -acetyl- 1 -tetralone (8) ] {{complexes}} have been synthesized in yields of 44 – 83 [*]% {{by a simple}} synthetic method by using sodium molybdate and the desired acac-type ligand as starting materials. All the complexes were characterized by IR, UV/Vis, NMR, and high-resolution ESI-MS, and for compounds 3, 4, and 8, solid-state structures were obtained by X-ray diffraction. All the complexes contain a cis-dioxomolybdenum moiety, as proven by the characteristic Mo=O vibrations in the IR spectra and the occurrence of four sets of signals in the NMR spectra of the complexes bearing asymmetrical ligands (4 and 6 – 8), and confirmed by the solid-state structures. The complexes {{were found to be}} active as catalysts in the dehydration of 1 -phenylethanol to styrene using technical-grade toluene as the solvent in air at 100 °C. The highest catalytic activity was found for [MoO 2 {(tBuCO) 2 CH} 2] (2), followed by [MoO 2 {(C 6 H 5 CO) 2 CH} 2] (3). Both complexes were also found to be active in the dehydration of other alcohols, including allylic, aliphatic, and homoallylic alcohols, as well as secondary and tertiary alcohols, with 2 generally showing better activity and selectivity than 3. These catalytic results were compared with those previously obtained with the metal-based catalyst Re 2 O 7 and the benchmark acid catalyst H 2 SO 4. The results were dependent on the substrate: By using 2, good selectivities but lower activities were generally obtained with tertiary alcohols, whereas good activities but lower selectivities were obtained with secondary alcohols. The industrially important dehydration of 2 -octanol to <b>octenes</b> was very efficiently catalyzed by 2. Overall, the [MoO 2 (acac′) 2] complexes reported herein could offer a cheaper and more abundant metal-based catalyst alternative to the previously reported rhenium-based catalytic system for the dehydration reaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the surface reactions that accompany the isomerization of butenes on a ferrierite (H-FER) catalyst by means of a packed-bed configured oscillating balance reactor (OBR). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and continuous mass spectrometric monitoring of the OBR product were used to discriminate between oligomerization and true coke formation. ^ Both 1 -butene and isobutene were contacted with the H-FER catalysts. For the n-butene-to-isobutene case, the modeling of the surface deposition process of high molecular weight species indicates that H-FER undergoes site blockage, followed by a pore blockage phase that sets in after c. a. 70 % the total uptake is achieved. Before reaching saturation uptake, a significant fraction of selective sites for isobutene formation are lost suggesting that such sites are unlikely to exist exclusively at the pore mouths of H-FER, as proposed earlier by other research groups. ^ For the isobutene adsorption/reaction case, the zeolite surface becomes covered with oligomeric hydrocarbons within the first few minutes on stream. There are a number of differences between the isobutene isomerization reaction and the n-butenes-to-isobutene transformation. The kinetically controlled regimes of these two reactions are roughly 70 K apart and the difference in apparent activation energies suggests that the two reactions are likely to proceed via different kinetic pathways. ^ DRIFTS and mass spectrometric results revealed that the production of <b>octenes</b> and/or higher oligomers goes through a maximum at short times on stream (i. e., before the zeolite pores reach saturation uptakes). This is consistent with the idea that bimolecular processes dominate the catalysis of fresh H-FER. A higher degree of branching in the oligomeric species formed by acid-catalyzed polymerization of isobutene, relative to those from 1 -butene, causes a smaller coke precursors critical uptake required to effect the site to pore blockage transition. The aging of such branched chains is slower than those resulting from a 1 -butene feed. ^ The impact of intrazeolitic oligomeric hydrocarbons on both its own formation rate and the skeletal isomerization process is also discussed. ...|$|R
