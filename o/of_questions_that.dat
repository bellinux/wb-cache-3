Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed the kinds <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> could be answered by mathematical methods.

Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincaré had begun in the 1890s.|$|E

[...] Other tests that can predict the development of PCS include the Hopkins Verbal Learning A test (HVLA) and the Digit Span Forward examination. [...] The HVLA tests verbal learning and memory by presenting a series of words and assigning points {{based on the number}} recalled, and digit span measures attention efficiency by asking the examinee to repeat back digits spoken by the tester in the same order as they are presented.

2500|$|The SAT {{has four}} sections: Reading, Writing and Language, Math (no calculator), and Math (calculator allowed). The test taker may {{optionally}} {{write an essay}} which, in that case, is the fifth test section. The total time for the scored portion of the SAT is three hours (or three hours and fifty minutes if the optional essay section is taken). Some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have a fifth section which is used, at least in part, for the pretesting <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> may appear on future administrations of the SAT. (These questions {{are not included in}} the computation of the SAT score.) Two section scores result from taking the SAT: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. Section scores are reported on a scale of 200 to 800, and each section score is a multiple of ten. A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding the two section scores, resulting in total scores that range from 400 to 1600. There is no penalty for guessing on the SAT: scores are {{based on the number of}} questions answered correctly. In addition to the two section scores, three [...] "test" [...] scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported, one for each of Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. The essay, if taken, is scored separately from the two section scores.|$|E
