In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Pennock {{in their book}} The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. He was inducted in the International League Hall of Fame in 1948. Noted baseball photographer Charles M. Conlon considered Pennock {{one of his favorite}} subjects to photograph.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this bird is <b>once</b> <b>called</b> 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered {{according to a}} medical papyrus, and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ʾbḳ-bird can be determined by help {{of the existence of}} Coptic abook 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren {{produced}} a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls, naming several new clades. Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia. Euskelia includes the temnospondyls that were <b>once</b> <b>called</b> rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies, the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea. Dissorophoids include small, mostly terrestrial temnospondyls {{that may be}} the ancestors of modern amphibians. Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like Eryops. The second major clade, Limnarchia, includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls, as well as some Permian groups. Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls, the stereospondyls.|$|E

5|$|The Castillonais or Cheval Ariègeois de Castillon, <b>once</b> <b>called</b> the cheval du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, is {{an ancient}} breed of small riding horse from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall it resembles (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color around the eyes and muzzle and {{on the underside of}} the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was <b>once</b> <b>called</b> 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was <b>once</b> <b>called</b> lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was <b>once</b> <b>called.</b> This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she <b>once</b> <b>called</b> home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} <b>once</b> <b>called</b> the golden honeyeater {{as it was}} {{considered}} to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white-eyes. Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian white-eyes of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white-eyes. The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other white-eyes where that primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the white-eyes.|$|E
