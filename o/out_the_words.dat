5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
500|$|Morrison's {{libretto}} was {{appreciated by}} various critics as [...] "charming" [...] and for having [...] "wit and characterful colours" [...] and supplying [...] "jaunty lines ... some individual characters, dramatic story-telling". Tanner, however, thought the text rather opaque {{and found the}} problem of comprehension aggravated by the high vocal lines which {{made it difficult to}} make <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Will Friedwald, {{this song}} {{is an example of}} Charles vocalizing in what would ordinarily be an {{generally}} extraneous manner for dramatic effect by using a different voice than he had ever previously exhibited. He sang [...] "... not just using the squeak—using a whole new kind of squeak, in fact—for additional coloring on the sidelines, but making it the heart of the matter, literally squeaking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and notes in harmony with the Raelettes" [...] (his background singers).|$|E

500|$|One of Bethe's {{most famous}} papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper. George Gamow added Bethe's name (in absentia) without {{consulting}} him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against Ralph Alpher's wishes. This was apparently {{a reflection of}} Gamow's sense of humor, wanting to have a paper title that would sound like the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. As one of the Physical Reviews reviewers, Bethe saw the manuscript and struck <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "in absentia".|$|E
500|$|During the Division Bell Tour, {{an unknown}} person {{using the name}} Publius posted a message on an {{internet}} newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights {{in front of the}} stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word [...] "enigma" [...] in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band.|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, the band's website {{underwent}} a complete overhaul, incorporating a new logo {{along with a}} clip of a previously unreleased song. The CMYK coloring was also notable with regard to an acrostic which appeared in a journal entry accompanying the site changes, spelling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Christianity Manufactures Yesterdays Killers". The album's title was revealed in September 2011. That same month, Manson and Twiggy attended the opening of artist Nick Kushner's exhibition at the Studio Servitu Gallery in LA, where the upcoming album was played in its entirety. LA Weekly attended the event and confirmed the upcoming album would be released in 2012.|$|E

500|$|It {{was here}} where the young Como {{acquired}} polish {{and his own}} unique style, {{with the help of}} Ted Weems. Mutual's Chicago affiliate [...] WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one could make <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to the songs he was singing. Weems told Como {{there was no need for}} him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.|$|E
500|$|While work {{continued}} on the album, Reznor hinted {{in an interview}} that it was [...] "part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on". [...] In February 2007 fans discovered that a new Nine Inch Nails tour t-shirt contained highlighted letters that spelled <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "I am trying to believe". This phrase was registered as a website URL, and soon several related websites were also discovered in the IP range, all describing a dystopian vision of the fictional [...] "Year 0". [...] It was later reported that 42 Entertainment had created these websites to promote Year Zero as part of an alternate reality game.|$|E
500|$|At Dwight's daycare, {{a poster}} for the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse is {{hung on the}} wall; however, Dwight has {{scribbled}} <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Insane" [...] and [...] "Posse" [...] to make it fit into the daycare. In the episode, Dwight's subplot is inspired by as Julia Roberts's character did in the film Pretty Woman. Dwight even attempts to use Roberts's line, [...] "Big mistake", but instead renders it as [...] "You made a big mistake. Huge!" [...] During Michael's counseling session, he sardonically tells Toby that he was probed by ALF, the alien star of the eponymous television series.

500|$|On December 5, 2016 Smith {{performed}} [...] "People Have the Power" [...] at Riverside Church, Manhattan, {{to celebrate}} the 20th anniversary of Democracy Now. She was joined by Michael Stipe. On December 10, 2016, Smith attended the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm on behalf of Bob Dylan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who himself could not be present due to prior commitments. After the official presentation speech for the literary prize by Horace Engdahl, {{a member of the}} Swedish Academy, Smith sang the Dylan song [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall". Overcome by nerves, she became unable to draw <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to the second verse. She stopped, and after a brief apology, resumed the song, which earned her a jubilant applause at the end.|$|E
500|$|Orfeo {{is guided}} by Speranza to the gates of Hades. Having pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> inscribed on the gate ("Abandon hope, all ye who enter here"), Speranza leaves. Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman Caronte, who {{addresses}} Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river Styx. Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him ("Mighty spirit and powerful divinity"), but the ferryman is unmoved. However, when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays, Caronte is soothed into sleep. Seizing his chance, Orfeo steals the ferryman's boat and crosses the river, entering the Underworld while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man: [...] "He has tamed the sea with fragile wood, and disdained the rage of the winds." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher has a contralto singing voice, {{described}} by author Nicholas E. Tawa as [...] "bold, deep, {{and with a}} spacious vibrato". Ann Powers of The New York Times called it [...] "a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting personality." [...] AllMusic's Bruce Eder wrote that the [...] "tremendous intensity and passion" [...] of Cher's vocals coupled with her [...] "ability to meld that projection with her acting skills" [...] can provide [...] "an incredibly powerful experience for the listener", despite her having a limited vocal range. Paul Simpson, in his book The Rough Guide to Cult Pop (2003), posits that [...] "Cher [...] the possessor {{of one of the}} huskiest, most distinctive voices in pop... which can work wonders with the right material directed by the right producer". He further addresses the believability of her vocal performances: [...] "she spits <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words...</b> with such conviction you'd think she was delivering an eternal truth about the human condition".|$|E

500|$|Details {{of a film}} {{examining}} Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren were reported in December 2011. The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] {{got a phone call}} from producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed to get <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' before I was already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

[...] Plant's own explanation of the lyrics was that it [...] "was some cynical aside about a woman getting everything she wanted all the time without giving back any thought or consideration. The first line begins with that cynical sweep of the hand ... and it softened up after that.|$|E
2500|$|The {{occupation}} of Denmark was initially not an important objective for the German government. The decision to occupy its small northern neighbor {{was taken to}} facilitate a planned invasion of the strategically more important Norway, and as a precaution against the expected British response. German military planners believed that a base {{in the northern part}} of Jutland, specifically the airfield of Aalborg, would be essential to operations in Norway, and they began planning the {{occupation of}} parts of Denmark. However, as late as February 1940 no firm decision to occupy Denmark had been made. The issue was finally settled when Adolf Hitler personally crossed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] ("the Northern tip of Jutland") and replaced them with , a German abbreviation for Denmark.|$|E
2500|$|For much of 2011, Manson removed {{himself from}} the public {{spotlight}} and ceased almost all communication with fans, only {{taking a break from}} his self-imposed sequestration to appear in the music video for [...] "Tempat Ku" [...] by Brunei rock band D'Hask. On February 24, longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced his resignation from the group. On May 22, their website underwent a complete overhaul. A 26-second clip of an unreleased song, tentatively titled [...] "I am among no one", was uploaded to their Vimeo account, along with a new logo. The CMYK coloring was also notable with regard to an acrostic which appeared in a journal entry accompanying the site changes, spelling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Christianity Manufactures Yesterdays Killers".|$|E
