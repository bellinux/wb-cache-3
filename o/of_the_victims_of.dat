5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But {{as soon as he}} became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Victims</b> <b>of</b> Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Victims</b> <b>of</b> Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E

40|$|Claims {{are made}} at {{international}} {{and at the}} national level in the UK that policies to tackle human trafficking are based on a human rights approach. Multiple claims are embedded within this claim about the nature and scale of human trafficking, presenting an idealised view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking as clearly defined. This perspective is contested in front-line encounters as street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky, 1980) are required to evaluate the claims made by concrete individuals to <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking status against these idealised images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking. Foucault’s (2011) discussion of parresia in his 1983 lecture on <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self is relevant in both meanings provided. First, claimants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking status necessarily make their claim without the freedom to speak and be recognised by the state, which Foucault describes as a political structure. They are strangers amongst <b>the</b> demos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation-state against which they make their claim. Second, claimants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> trafficking status must demonstrate they are speaking the truth, in the more social sense described by Foucault, by demonstrating the risks they have taken in their journey, usually with their own body as <b>the</b> warrant <b>of</b> evidence supporting their claim. This paper considers <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> street-level bureaucrats exercising their judgement when assessing <b>the</b> credibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounts they receive from putative <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> human trafficking. Utilise a theoretical model for evaluating <b>the</b> credibility <b>of</b> non-governmental organisations (Gourevitch & Lake, 2012), I develop a conceptualisation of ‘victim of trafficking’ as a fluid status that is dependent on individuals required to enact a familiar image of vulnerability and victimhood for street-level bureaucrats...|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who praised the actors' portrayal {{of their respective}} characters but found the film underwhelming. A few organisations fighting for the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the tragedy blamed the film for presenting the facts in a distorted manner. Kumar and Sheen denied these allegations. The Madhya Pradesh government exempted the film from paying tax.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{performed}} {{more than one}} hundred times during Smetana's lifetime (the first Czech opera to reach this landmark), subsequently becoming a permanent feature of the National Theatre's repertory.

5|$|The wars {{had caused}} {{widespread}} devastation and famine, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, {{who died of}} typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.|$|E

A national moment of silence was held at 11:00a.m. EST on January 10, 2011 on the South Lawn of the White House as well as the steps of the United States Capitol.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|American {{rock band}} Bon Jovi played the venue during the One Wild Night Tour in 2001.

The stadium has also been host to Madonna on two occasions, the first in July 2006 {{when she opened the}} UK leg of her Confessions Tour, and most recently in August 2008 when she kicked off her Sticky & Sweet Tour at the stadium. Other performers who have played at the stadium include Robbie Williams as part of his Weddings, Barmitzvahs & Stadiums Tour, U2 as part of their Vertigo Tour, Red Hot Chili Peppers as part of their By the Way tour, The Rolling Stones as part of their A Bigger Bang Tour, Bon Jovi as part of their One Wild Night Tour, R.E.M. as part of their Monster tour and again for their Around the Sun tour.|$|E

5|$|American {{troops were}} able to recover the bodies of only three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the {{massacre}} due to {{the chaos of the}} battle and subsequent American withdrawal, and were unable to capture any North Korean troops who participated in the massacre. For his actions in volunteering to stay behind with the wounded, Herman G. Felhoelter was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest decoration for valor awarded by the U.S. military. He was the first chaplain of the war to receive an award for valor. He received a brief obituary in Time Magazine in December 1952. Felhoelter was the first of twelve chaplains killed or missing at that point in the war, including Emil J. Kapaun, the second chaplain of the war to be awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to racial}} {{segregation}} at the time, the coffins provided {{were used for}} the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the African Americans who were killed and some of those whose race could not be identified were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried at Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen and attended by about 3,000people, including educator Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for the families <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E
