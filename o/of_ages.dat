5|$|In Oracle <b>of</b> <b>Ages,</b> {{the central}} item is the Harp <b>of</b> <b>Ages,</b> which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E

5|$|The first Myst titles used pre-rendered graphics, and {{digitally}} inserted {{footage of}} live actors into the backgrounds. For Myst V: End <b>of</b> <b>Ages,</b> {{a different approach}} was taken; a special camera recorded actor's faces and mapped the video onto digital models. The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment. Reviewers found that the live action characters increased immersion, while the digital body language and spoken conviction in End <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> endeared the characters to the player.

5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End <b>of</b> <b>Ages</b> was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End <b>of</b> <b>Ages,</b> Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{longitudinal}} effects of sleep duration and quality on lipid profiles {{during the transition}} from childhood to early adolescence, over a 4 -year-period. STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study of children born in 1998 examined at 8 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> (SD,[*] 0. 3; n[*]=[*] 105) and 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> (SD,[*] 0. 5; n[*]=[*] 190). Sleep duration, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and weekend catch-up sleep were measured with actigraphs for 7 (8 years <b>of</b> <b>age)</b> and 8 (12 years <b>of</b> <b>age)</b> nights. Fasting serum samples were collected at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Covariates included age, pubertal development, socioeconomic status, body mass index, and physical activity. RESULTS: In girls, shorter sleep duration at 8 and 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and higher triglycerides at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Poorer sleep quality at 8 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and longer weekend catch-up sleep at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> was associated with higher triglycerides at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> From 8 to 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> improvement in sleep quality associated with higher total cholesterol, {{and a decrease in}} sleep duration with lower lipid levels. In boys, longer sleep duration at 8 years <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> and a larger decrease in sleep duration from 8 to 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> was associated with higher levels of triglycerides at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Poorer sleep during transition to early adolescence is associated with an atherogenic lipid profile in early adolescent girls, and such effects are less prominent in boys.
