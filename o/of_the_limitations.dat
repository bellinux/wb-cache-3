5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts {{governor}} Mitt Romney for instituting {{gay marriage}} entirely on his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or {{authority to do}} so under Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney's actions, which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> of the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, {{in compliance with the}} court ruling.|$|E

5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limitations</b> that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
