50|$|A newer form of {{a hybrid}} system is the {{combination}} of passive phase-detection auto-focus and passive contrast auto-focus, sometimes assisted by active methods, as both methods need some visible contrast to work with. Under their operational conditions, phase-detection auto-focusing is very fast, since the measurement method provides both information, the amount of offset and the direction, so that the focusing motor can move the lens right into (or close to) focus without additional measurements. Additional measurements on the fly, however, can improve accuracy or help keep track of moving objects. However, the accuracy of phase-detection auto-focus depends on its effective measurement basis. If the measurement basis is large, measurements are very accurate, but can only work with lenses with a large geometrical aperture (e.g. 1:2.8 or larger). Even with high contrasty objects, phase-detection AF cannot work at all with lenses slower than its effective measurement basis. In order to work with most lenses, the effective measurement basis is typically set to between 1:5.6 and 1:6.7, so that AF continues to work with slow lenses (at least {{for as long as}} they are not stopped down). This, however, reduces the intrinsical accuracy of the autofocus system, even if fast lenses are used. Since the effective measurement basis is an optical property of the actual implementation, it cannot be changed easily. Very few cameras provide multi-PD-AF systems with several switchable measurement bases depending on the lens used in order to allow normal auto-focusing with most lenses, and more accurate focusing with fast lenses.Contrast AF does not have this inherit design limitation on accuracy as it only needs a minimal <b>object</b> <b>contrast</b> to work with. Once this is available, it can work with high accuracy regardless of the speed of a lens; in fact, for as long as this condition is met, it can even work with the lens stopped down. Also, since contrast AF continues to work in stopped-down mode rather than only in open-aperture mode, it is immune to aperture-based focus shift errors phase-detection AF systems suffer since they cannot work in stopped-down mode. Thereby, contrast AF makes arbitrary fine-focus adjustments by the user unnecessary. Also, contrast AF is immune to focusing errors due to surfaces with repeating patterns and they can work over the whole frame, not just near the center of the frame, as phase-detection AF does. The down-side, however, is that contrast AF is a closed-loop iterative process of shifting the focus back and forth in rapid succession. Compared to phase-detection AF, contrast AF is slow, since the speed of the focus iteration process is mechanically limited and this measurement method does not provide any directional information. Combining both measurement methods, the phase-detection AF can assist a contrast AF system to be fast and accurate at the same time, to compensate aperture-based focus-shift errors, and to continue to work with lenses stopped down, as, for example, in stopped-down measuring or video mode.|$|E

Local skewness is estimated using a sliding computational window applied to a sonar image, thus generating local skewness image of which a square structure {{is associated with a}} potential object.

40|$|Both the {{luminance}} {{contrast of}} an object, {{and the nature}} of the background texture over which it moves, are known to influence its perceived speed. In this study the effect of <b>object</b> <b>contrast</b> upon perceived speed was investigated for targets moving across textured patterns of various contrasts. Experiment 1 showed a strong effect of contrast for objects moving over homogenous backgrounds, that was reduced or abolished if the object moved over a textured background. A further experiment suggested that this reduction may be the result of an increase in target visibility, perhaps as a result of additional ‘second order’ motion signals produced by motion over texture backgrounds. A final experiment suggested that two processes were occurring: (1) higher contrast backgrounds appeared to increase the perceived speeds of all objects; and (2) that higher contrast backgrounds eliminated the contrast induced changes in perceived speed...|$|E

This variation is examined using the familiar Weak Phase Object Approximation model from which it is determined that the contrast ratio achieves a maximum at a small nonzero value of the spherical aberration. This result is confirmed by multislice modelling which allows for deviations from the Weak Phase Object Approximation and delocalization effects.

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for image enhancement and restoration. The main difficulty is how to enhance the structures uniformly while suppressing the noise without artifacts. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the gradient domain instead of the traditional intensity domain. By enhancing the gradient field, we can enhance the structure uniformly without overshooting at the boundary. Because the gradient field is very sensitive to noise, we apply an orientationisotropy adaptive filter to the gradient field, suppressing the gradients in the noise regions while enhancing along the object boundaries. Thus we obtain a modulated gradient field, which is usually not integrable. We reconstruct the enhanced image from the modulated gradient field with least square errors by solving a Poisson equation. This method can enhance the <b>object</b> <b>contrast</b> uniformly, suppress the noise with no artifacts, and avoid setting stopping time as in PDE methods. Experiments on noisy images show the efficacy of our method. 1...|$|E

We face the challenge to automate the process of detecting and locating moving objects. Photogrammetry offers a proven technique to locate objects, called stereo restitution. If we record an object in a certain time period with a sequence of pairs of stereo images, we can determine the object location for every instance during that time period. Setting homologous points for a large sequence of stereo images by hand is unpractical, leading us to research possibilities for automation with digital image processing. In this work I describe features of digital images and theoretical solutions for object detection and tracking. For this purpose I also wrote a test software for automatic object detection and setting of their homologous points.

40|$|A Figure-of-Merit for the {{performance}} of any medical array is defined, which is new in the field of medical imaging: the <b>object</b> <b>contrast</b> parameter. This contrast parameter quantifies the contrast between an on-axis object and its surroundings and as such is closely related to the visibility of an object. Its behaviour as a function of depth depends on the physical array properties and the electronic settings (e. g. delay settings). With the aid of a simulation tool the significance of the contrast parameters is evaluated. It was shown that the contrast parameter is a useful parameter in addition to the conventional Figures-of-Merit used to assess the array performance, such as beam diameter and grating lobe level. In particular the contrast parameter facilitates the making of compromises between beamdiameter and grating lobe levels, which impose conflicting demands on the design of the array.
