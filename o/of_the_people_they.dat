5|$|The {{events of}} September 11 added {{new meaning to}} In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after {{the success of their}} {{previous}} collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> had interviewed to see how the events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.|$|E
5|$|The troupe hired several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> {{had worked}} with on Brain Candy, {{including}} Craig Northey and director Kelly Makin. They shot the series in North Bay, along with locations in Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, which allowed them to access federal and provincial funding incentives for economic development in Northern Ontario. For example, the courtroom scenes were filmed in North Bay's Trinity United Church and the graveyard site was filmed on Mattawa's Explorer's Point. McKinney has claimed in interviews that the red vest worn by Death {{was found in a}} storehouse of old CBC props and costumes, and was previously worn by Bob Homme in The Friendly Giant. While drafting the script, cast member Scott Thompson was diagnosed with stage one non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He began chemotherapy sessions shortly before the August – September 2009 shooting dates and started four weeks of radiation treatment once shooting wrapped.|$|E

25|$|Modern historiography of Belgium {{began to}} appear in the later 18th century, as {{scholars}} moved beyond the chronicles of particular provinces, cities or leaders and relied on rapidly accumulating data. They wrote dissertations using the critical approach to particular historical problems. This development was sponsored by The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and reflected Enlightenment influences—such as that of Voltaire—in exploring the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>They</b> pondered questions of causality. Their goal was building the blocks for a general history of the Austrian Netherlands, thus marking an important step toward the creation of a Belgian national history.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{drift in}} American {{political}} science {{is a theory}} that seeks to explain the tendency for bureaucratic agencies to create policy that deviates from the original mandate. While some scholars believe that structural organization can help lessen bureaucratic drift, other scholars have found that this approach can backfire. When a bureaucracy is permeable anyone can access it, including legislators who were originally adverse to the legislation being implemented. Further, scholars argue that if a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations {{are more likely to}} reflect the views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> are representing than they are the views of the legislature.|$|E

Although the language of the court was Old Norman or Old French (Langue d'oïl), all royal edicts were written in the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> were addressed to: Latin, Byzantine Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew.

25|$|The Vendée revolt {{became an}} {{immediate}} symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, {{and a source}} of unexpurgated violence. The region, and its towns, were eliminated; even the department name of Vendée was renamed Venge. Towns and cities were also renamed, but at heart, in villages and farms, the old names remained the same. Beyond the controversial interpretations of genocide, other historians posit the insurrection as a revolt against conscription that cascaded to include other complaints. For a period of several months, control of the Vendée slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries. They ascribed the revolt to the resurgence of royalist ideas: when faced with insurrection of the people against the Revolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> <b>they</b> were unable to see it as anything but an aristocratic plot. Mona Ozouf and François Furet maintain it was not. The entire territory, none of it unified under a single idea from the ancien regime, had never been a region morally at odds {{with the rest of the}} nation. It was not the fall of the old regime that aroused the population against the Revolution, but rather the construction of the new regime into locally unacceptable principles and forms: the new map of districts and departments, the administrative dictatorship, and above all the non-juring priests. Rebellion had first flared in August 1792, but had been immediately quelled. Even the regicide did not trigger insurrection. What did was the forced conscription. Although the Vendeans, to use the term loosely, wrote God and King large on their flags, they invested those symbols of their tradition with something other than regret for the lost regime.|$|E

Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars, Jews, and Gypsies as well as actual or alleged partisans throughout Eastern Europe.|$|E
500|$|Haitian-American {{musician}} Wyclef Jean {{also serves}} as a producer. In addition, Wyclef Jean sings the first line of the second chorus in Haitian Creole.

Why not bring in Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers and let them address the issues?" [...] adding that [...] "It was designed so that we wouldn't have any of the originals there, so that we could pass on the baton to the next generation". Phillips said that the producers received 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> wanted as recording artists for the song.

500|$|Negron first {{appears in}} the film's frame story as a bitter, 70-year-old World War II veteran living in Harlem, New York who {{reflects}} on his experiences during World War II. Negron, a black Puerto Rican, is fluent in English, Spanish and Italian, which enables him {{to serve as a}} translator for the Americans and Italians. [...] Alonso first learned of the novel from his agent and read it prior to auditioning for the role. [...] He had to convince Lee that he was fluent in Spanish, and created an audition tape of himself speaking the language, which won him the role. Alonso found difficulty in portraying Negron as an elderly World War II veteran: “This role was very emotionally draining. Ninety percent of the time, the elderly have outlived most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> have loved. When I played Negrón as an old man, I had to focus on everything I’ve lost in my life: my dad, friends and love lost, and that was a really depressing thing to do.” ...|$|E

500|$|On 30 May Ibrahim Pasha re-entered Jerusalem and {{the next}} day Egyptian troops {{attacked}} Beit Jala, a nearby Christian village. A reported 33 men and women were killed there because of their alleged involvement in the looting of Egyptian property. The purported revenge killings were halted by Ibrahim Pasha, but the residents' livestock was seized. The next day, over 1,000 rebels from the Ta'amirah tribe entered the adjacent town of Bethlehem to protect their families and the Christian inhabitants from potentially experiencing the same fate as Beit Jala. They refrained from directly confronting Ibrahim Pasha, however. Bethlehem's Muslim Quarter was destroyed by the Egyptian army and its inhabitants disarmed. This move was apparently a punishment for the killing of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha. Reverend William McClure Thomson wrote [...] "this terrible vengeance failed to quell the turbulent spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>They</b> are ever distinguished in the great feasts at Jerusalem by their fierce and lawless manners, and if any row occurs they are sure to have a hand in it." [...] The peasant rebels had frequently requested from the Christians of Bethlehem that they fight alongside them against Ibrahim Pasha's troops. The Christians refused, citing their religious beliefs and political status, and sheltered in the town's monasteries for safety. On 3 June, the rebels decided to attack the monasteries and looted the city. On 4 June rebels launched an attack on Ibrahim Pasha and about 4,000 of his men at Solomon's Pools near al-Khader.|$|E
500|$|Ravenloft's success led to {{a sequel}} in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill. Although Tracy Hickman was {{credited}} in RavenloftII, he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module {{in order to meet}} the deadline. Clyde Caldwell, who had done all of the art for the original Ravenloft module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by Jeff Easley. The adventure is designed for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large color map and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that Gryphon Hill plays differently each time. The module's plot features an artifact known as The Apparatus that switches a monster's personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>they</b> meet. The module also introduces Azalin the lich, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original Ravenloft. It includes descriptions of the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all mapped in perspective like the original module.|$|E
