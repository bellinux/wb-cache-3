40|$|Public {{involvement}} in environmental management {{has become an}} important component of decision making, which had been until the 1970 's based almost entirely on "economic efficiency" and "science centred approach". EIA, the most widespread instrument asking for public {{involvement in}} environmental management has been reconceptualised to incorporate concepts of sustainable development for which EIA is well fitted provided it is a "holistic", "preventive" and "participative" instrument. However, depending on political, institutional and social contexts EIA processes, by <b>opening</b> <b>decision</b> making to the public sphere, still represent a great shift in traditional planning. EIA was introduced in the Portuguese legal system in 1990 due to the Portuguese membership in the European Union and public participation became mandatory. The intriguing question {{on the basis of this}} investigation is how a society labelled as having a non-participative culture and where decision making has never been opened to public scrutiny behaves with such an instrument. A broad picture of EIA public participation in the Portuguese society has been outlined, the approach taken stressing the importance of cultural contexts in getting insights to the understanding of the phenomenon. This broad picture has been enhanced by the use of an in-depth case study of the Portuguese reality in order to stress relevant features. An analytical model to guide the investigation has been constructed by putting together pieces of consensus on public participation effectiveness identifying key issues and key criteria. This investigation indicates that despite the reactive approach taken to EIA and the weakness of the Portuguese EIA system, EIA has been contributing to a change in public perceptions as well as in attitudes of developers, consultants, government and institutions towards environmental management. It is increasingly felt that EIA got roots in Portuguese society being the instrument that asks more regularly and with more efficacy for public involvement. In pair with this, it is also recognised that EIA needs reformulations to make it a more effective, comprehensive and credible tool. Public participation in the Portuguese EIA system presents several difficulties related to the social/cultural context and to the procedures used in its implementation. The former deals in a great part with the lack of traditions of participation in society, the strong weight of representative democracy and the low levels of environmental consciousness. The later deals with the late phase of public involvement, poor mechanisms used to disseminate information and promote a two-way communication and the use of a standard bureaucratic process. Environmental problems arrived late to Portuguese society but have become increasingly relevant due to the development policies followed. Signs exist now that the traditional passive citizenship can give place to a more active one and that the lay public increasingly feel that they have a word to say in decisions affecting their quality of life. Some avenues have been explored in this investigation related to context and practice of public involvement in EIA and to the challenge posed by sustainable development to societies especially those considered of intermediate development...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{multi-stage}} capacity expansion problem under demand uncertainty. We {{consider the}} problem {{where there are}} multiple resources to be expanded at each stage. Moreover, the resources have limited life time after acquisition. Our goal {{is to determine the}} time and size of each resource to be expanded so that the expected expansion cost of capacities is minimized. Therefore, we formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer program. Capacity shortage and excess are allowed subject to a joint chance constraint. We apply the multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer model to formulate vaccine vial <b>opening</b> <b>decisions</b> in the health clinics. This formulation enables us to find the optimal combination of vial sizes to be opened. Additionally, a trade off between vaccine wastage and shortage can be addressed using the chance constraint. We provide a branch and price algorithm based on a nodal decomposition to solve the model. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the subproblems where the life time of the resources is limited to one period. We implement the branch and price algorithm assuming continuous capacity expansion decisions. Computational results are presented for the vaccine vial opening problem with three vial sizes; 1 -, 5 -, and 10 -doses. The primary results indicate the strength of the proposed algorithm in solving problems with large dimensions. Moreover we report results that indicate the usage of 10 -dose vials and the portion of 10 -dose vials in the total vaccine usage increases with the arrival rate. Although the total usage of 1 - and 5 - dose vials increase with the arrival rate, their portion in the total vaccine usage decreases. This implies that vaccination wastage or shortage can be managed by keeping moderate amount of smaller size vials while supplying most of the demand using larger vial sizes to benefit from the economies of scale...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{well-known}} real option: {{the opening and}} closing of mines. Using a new database that tracks the annual <b>opening</b> and closing <b>decisions</b> of 285 developed North American gold mines in the period 1988 - 1997, we confirm many of the predictions from real options models.

Together, the data provide strong support for the real options model as a useful model to describe and predict a mine's <b>opening</b> and shutting <b>decisions.</b> In addition, we find that the decision whether to shut a mine is related to firm-specific managerial factors not normally considered within a strict real options model, most notably the profitability of other mines in the firm's portfolio and of the firm's other businesses.

The methodology of a grounded theory, and a semi-structured interview method, {{were used for the}} study. Fifty interviews were carried out with Friends group members, library staff and managers, and councillors in five councils in England. There were more respondents who agreed than disagreed with Friends groups being allowed to influence library policy. The present groups have influenced many policy areas, such as policy on <b>opening</b> hours, <b>decisions</b> on library closure and building a new library, and library rules and regulations. They have exerted an influence on these areas mainly through campaigns or lobbying. However, there were also respondents who had personal concerns about the strong influence of Friends groups, particularly through these activities. They did not approve of these activities as being the ideal method of Friends groups to get involved in library policy. This is because these activities caused conflicts between Friends groups and library authorities or councillors. The respondents who had many experiences of such conflicts perceived Friends groups to be unrepresentative of library users and the community. Influential groups, which had an impact on library policy, were born as influential groups. They were formed with unique managerial elements, such as simple and clear goals, spontaneous establishment, strong leadership, a well-structured and active committee, and strong membership power, i. e. having many professionals and famous people as their members, such as politicians, artists, writers, and celebrities. The majority of the respondents agreed with the establishment of a British National Friends of Libraries organisation (NFOL), and considered its role in enhancing the operation of Friends groups, in supporting library services, and in campaigning to the government. However, many respondents did not recognise the fact that the Library Campaign (LC) had become a new' British NFOL, and many group members did not have much information about the LC. Consequently, the study suggests that the LC publicise itself more actively and that Cilip support the publicity of the LC. The study revealed that consultation is the most sensible method of getting Friends groups involved in library policy. Accordingly, the study suggests that Friends groups, library management, and councillors make guidelines for consultation. The study concludes that Friends groups could successfully operate and get effectively involved in library policy, if: together with library management they create some guidelines for the operation of Friends groups; they invite professionals and famous people to their group; and they maintain good communication with their members, the community, library staff, councillors, and also the local media...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{a highly}} dynamic {{morphogenesis}} process; however, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the timing of the different molecular processes involved. Although the role of the VEGF-notch-DLL 4 signaling pathway has been established as essential for tip/stalk cell competition during sprouting, the speed and dynamic properties of the underlying process at the individual cell level has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using mathematical modeling we investigate how specific, biologically meaningful, local conditions around and within an individual cell can influence their unique tip/stalk phenotype switching kinetics. To this end we constructed an ordinary differential equation model of VEGF-notch-DLL 4 signaling in a system of two, coupled endothelial cells (EC). Our studies reveal that at any given point in an angiogenic vessel the time it takes a cell to decide to take on a tip or stalk phenotype may be drastically different, and this asynchrony of tip/stalk cell decisions along vessels itself acts to speed up later competitions. We unexpectedly uncover intermediate "partial" yet stable states lying between the tip and stalk cell fates, and identify that internal cellular factors, such as NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin- 1 (Sirt 1) and Lunatic fringe 1 (Lfng 1), can specifically determine the length of time a cell spends in these newly identified partial tip/stalk states. Importantly, the model predicts that these partial EC states can arise during normal angiogenesis, in particular during cell rearrangement in sprouts, providing a novel two-stage mechanism for rapid adaptive behavior to the cells highly dynamic environment. Overall, this study demonstrates that different factors (both internal and external to EC) can be used to modulate the speed of tip/stalk <b>decisions,</b> <b>opening</b> up new opportunities and challenges for future biological experiments and therapeutic targeting to manipulate vascular network topology, and our basic understanding of developmental/pathological angiogenesis...|$|R

The problem is related to the supply chain management of a multi-site production network in which production units are subject to purchase, <b>opening</b> or shut-down <b>decisions</b> leading to an MILP model based on a time-indexed formulation. Besides the framework of the SSDOP approach and consistent net present value calculations, this model includes two additional special and original features: a detailed nonlinear price structure for the raw material purchase model, and a detailed discussion of transport times with respect to the time discretization scheme involving a probability concept. In a maximizing net profit scenario the client reports cost saving of several millions US$. The strategic feature present in the model is analyzed in a consistent framework based on the operational planning model, and vice versa. The demand driven operational planning part links consistently to and influ-ences the strategic. Since the results (strategic desicions or designs) have consequences for many years, and depend on demand forecast, raw mate-rial availability, and expected costs or sales prices, resp., a careful sensitivity analysis is necessary showing how stable the decisions might be with respect to these input data. 2 Josef Kallrath Key words MILP modelling – Strategic and operational planning – Sup-ply chain – Chemical industry – Transportation...|$|R

For the Daisytek French subsidiary, both English and French courts have opened main insolvency cases, and an appeal is pending before the French Cour de Cassation, where the Ministry of Justice is expected to recommend submission to the ECJ. Two very important substantive modifications would vastly improve the EU Regulation. First. the EU Regulation needs {{to provide for the}} filing in the same country (thereby permitting the filing in the same court) of members of a corporate group that are economically integrated. It is very difficult (if at all possible) to recognize a corporate empire when its insolvency proceedings are distributed among a number of countries. Second, the EU Regulation needs to clarify the definition of 2 ̆ 2 center of main interest 2 ̆ 2 (CoMI) and to specify what a court should consider in making the CoMI decision. A court should weigh the following factors: (1) the location of operations and management decisions for the corporation; (2) the location of the 2 ̆ 2 nerve center 2 ̆ 2 or place of principal decision-making for the corporation; and (3) the expectations of creditors, such as suppliers and financiers, as to the CoMI decision in the event that the company foes into an insolvency proceeding. This Article also argues for three kinds of procedural improvements: (1) decoupling the decision on whether a proceeding is a main proceeding from the <b>decision</b> <b>opening</b> the proceeding itself, to give an opportunity to the parties in interest to be heard on the subject of whether a proceeding is a main proceeding; (2) defining what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 judgment opening insolvency proceedings, 2 ̆ 2 to specify what steps qualify under this term in those countries where an opening order or judgment is not a typical part of the insolvency process; (3) adopting procedures to recognize the due process rights of foreign estate administrators, foreign creditors, and other parties in interest in a cross-border insolvency proceeding...|$|R
