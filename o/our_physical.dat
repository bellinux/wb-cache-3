40|$|Abstract There is {{good reason}} to suppose that <b>our</b> best <b>physical</b> theories, quantum {{mechanics}} and special relativity, are false if taken together and literally. If they are in fact false, then how should they count as providing knowledge of the physical world? One might imagine that, while strictly false, <b>our</b> best <b>physical</b> theories are nevertheless in some sense probably approximately true. This paper presents a notion of local probable approximate truth in terms of descriptive nesting relations between current and subsequent theories. This notion helps explain how false physical theories might nevertheless provide physical knowledge of a variety that is particularly salient to diachronic empirical inquiry. 1 Description, Error, and Approximate Truth It is customary to imagine that <b>our</b> best <b>physical</b> theories are true, probably true, or probably approximately true. 1 This view of the proper cognitive status of <b>our</b> best <b>physical</b> theories is well-expressed by Isaac Newton in Rule IV of his Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy: In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induction should be considered exactly or very nearly true not withstanding any contrary hypothesis, until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions.

By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar topology.

2500|$|In Kabbalistic {{understanding}} of gilgul, which differs from many Eastern-religious views, reincarnation is not fatalistic or automatic, {{nor is it}} essentially a punishment of sin, or reward of virtue. In Judaism, the Heavenly realms could fulfill Maimonides' Principle of faith in Reward and Punishment. Rather, it {{is concerned with the}} process of individual Tikkun (Rectification) of the soul. In Kabbalistic interpretation, each Jewish soul is reincarnated enough times only in order to fulfil each of the 613 Mitzvot. The souls of the righteous among the Nations may be assisted through gilgulim to fulfil their Seven Laws of Noah. As such gilgul is an expression of Divine compassion, and is seen as a Heavenly agreement with the individual soul to descend again. This stress on physical performance and perfection of each Mitzvah is tied to the Lurianic doctrine of Cosmic Tikkun of Creation. In these new teachings, a cosmic catastrophe occurred at the beginning of creation called the [...] "Shattering of the Vessels" [...] of the Sephirot in the [...] "World of Tohu (Chaos)". The vessels of the Sephirot broke and fell down through the spiritual worlds until they were embedded in <b>our</b> <b>physical</b> realm as [...] "sparks of holiness" [...] (Nitzutzot). The reason in Lurianic Kabbalah that almost all Mitzvot involve physical action is that through their performance, they elevate each particular spark of holiness associated with that commandment. Once all the sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the Messianic Era begins. This metaphysical theology gives cosmic significance to the life of each person, as each individual has particular tasks that only they can fulfil. Therefore, gilgulim assist the individual soul in this cosmic plan. This also explains the Kabbalistic reason why the future eschatological Utopia will be in this world, as only in the lowest, physical realm is the purpose of creation fulfilled.|$|E
