40|$|Building {{maintenance}} {{in conservation}} of <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> {{is one of}} the approaches applied within the built environment of Malaysia. For instance, it is realised that these <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> contribute an important significance to our nation's priceless heritage and unique historical development. However, most of these buildings' maintenance is influenced by related problems that affect the overall building conservation approach. Therefore, these <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> face problems which greatly affect their overall condition and performance: building structure; building appearance and aesthetic; building materials and building character. In most critical situations, there is a greater possibility that we could lose the cultural significance and heritage values of these <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> through ignoring the related problems. This paper tries to identify the related problems, reveal the findings and discuss suitable approaches to conserving these <b>old</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Old Priory, {{which was}} a hotel and restaurant, dates from the early to mid 17th century. Another <b>old</b> <b>building</b> is the Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost, which is a 15th-century tithe barn {{converted}} by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. It is a grade II* listed building. The local Catholic community are served by Benedictine monks from nearby Downside Abbey, coming under the Diocese of Clifton.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the <b>old</b> <b>building</b> (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's <b>old</b> <b>building</b> at Brook and Oak.|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{acceleration}} of Chinese urbanization, the expansion, renovation and demolition of <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> is on the stage together with the design and construction of new buildings every day in downtown {{of the old city}} area. The coordinative symbiosis between new and <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> is an important problem which needs to be solved in the process of urban development. By studying and analyzing the case of Shanghai Citic Plaza and surroundings, this paper contributes to discussing the concept, value and problems to be solved of the coordination of new and <b>old</b> <b>buildings,</b> meanwhile, striking the balance between new and <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> from the aspects of architectural form, space, function and local context. As a result, the strategy of the coordinative symbiosis between new and <b>old</b> <b>buildings</b> is summarized, which can offer some guiding principles to urban development from now on...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building {{near the center of}} the city built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp for a brief period before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the <b>old</b> <b>building</b> went through renovations. Both schools are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Building.</b> It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E

It is now used as a centre for arts and crafts. Finally, the headquarters of Danish Distillers (De Danske Spritfabrikker), {{to the west of}} the Limfjord Bridge, is noted for its Neoclassical appearance. Completed in 1931 by the architect Alf Cock-Clausen, it combines functionality with decorative classical symbolism. Considered a masterpiece of Danish factory design, it is now a Danish National Heritage site. When the factory closed in 2014, was the area bought by an investor, who will use the buildings to create an international culture city with museums, theatres, apartments etc.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its <b>old</b> <b>building</b> at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Ma was {{appointed}} the Director of the Shanghai Museum. When {{the museum was}} omitted from Shanghai's five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building where the museum was then housed, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People's Square, but the museum had to raise its own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the <b>old</b> <b>building</b> to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another US$10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually persuaded the city government to allocate another 140 million yuan to complete the building.|$|E

5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, <b>old</b> <b>building</b> or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E
5|$|The first county {{courthouse}} {{was a small}} log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed {{to make way for}} a new courthouse; the <b>old</b> <b>building</b> was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the first state capitol building. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000. The building was designed by Fowler and Karges of Evansville and was constructed by J. Fred Beggs and Company of Scottsburg.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{paperwork}} for the O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company {{was completed}} in late 1903 and the company was formally created in February 1904 by O'Brien as the majority shareholder with 77 percent of the stock, and six other investors. The company had an initial capital of $200,000 and owned $53,000 of land in Klondike City, just {{across the river from}} Dawson, which O'Brien had sold to the new company. George Mero was employed to build the new brewery at considerable speed - 15 days were allowed for the work's completion - converting O'Brien's <b>old</b> <b>building</b> for its new use. The brewery was situated alongside the Klondike Mines Railway terminal, also owned by O'Brien. It opened for business in April.|$|E
