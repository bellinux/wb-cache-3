25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E

50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch.</b> Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch.</b> In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|E

40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on <b>switching</b> off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R
50|$|Rigon {{started from}} the pit lane, {{following}} a gearbox change after race one. From the start, polesitter Wissel led from Toccacelo and Jackson with action towards {{the back with}} Soucek's engine blowing. Jackson moved up to second, passing Toccacelo {{around the back of}} the circuit and closed up on Wissel down the front straight, and at Curva 1, Jackson would take the lead for a couple of laps. On lap 4, Toccacelo came up to the back of the Englishman's car, having already disposed of Wissel and did the same to Jackson. Towards the back, Perera and Vallés would collide at turn six, with Perera spinning into the gravel and retirement and Vallés retreating to the pits for a new nosecone. Dalziel also had a moment, and spun into retirement as well, with unrepairable accident damage. Out front, Toccacelo was establishing a healthy lead before his pit-stop on lap 14. Andersen then led for three laps before his pitstop, handing the lead back to Toccacelo, with Meijer now in tow, thanks to an early pitstop on lap 10. Wissel and Andersen would both retire in the late stages with mechanical problems and with three laps to go, gremlins would strike Toccacelo. Fading <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switched</b> the engine's ECU into safety mode, and was helpless in stopping Meijer through to the lead. After recording his first pole at Zolder, Meijer recorded his first win by nearly two seconds from Doornbos (up from 17th) with Pier Guidi, Pizzonia and Rigon further deposing Toccacelo before the flag. García, Buurman, Dolby, Rocha, Jackson and Vallés completed the finishers. Healthy finishes for Rigon allowed Beijing to head to the penultimate round at Vallelunga with a 35-point lead from PSV, with Liverpool now in third just a point further back. With a maximum of 200 points available, the championship is still wide open.|$|R
5000|$|Engine-wise, the GN Sigma {{was offered}} either with the Astron 2.0-litre ( [...] at 5600 rpm and 152 Nm at 2400 rpm) or the Astron II 2.6-litre ( [...] at 5200 rpm and 200 Nm at 2400 rpm) units. The Astron II {{had a few}} changes over the {{previous}} models, notably a newly designed head with hydraulic tappets (replacing the manual tappets in previous Astrons) and flat-top pistons. The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> was now located {{at the rear of}} the cylinder block. In December 1985, the 2.0-litre versions were dropped, as Mitsubishi did not believe it warranted the conversion to unleaded fuel. Unleaded was introduced in Australia in January 1986.|$|E
50|$|Overheating is {{a serious}} concern for the engine, since the engine block is of an open-deck design, severe {{overheating}} could cause the cylinder barrels to warp and {{pull away from the}} head gasket, causing coolant leaks into the cylinders and cylinder scuffing. Maintaining oil and coolant levels is crucial for the engine. The engine is equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> which grounds out the primary-ignition system should the oil pressure fall below 6 psi during operation, thus stopping and preventing the engine from being restarted until the oil level was replenished or the mechanical cause of low-oil pressure was remedied. Chevrolet dealers installed a coolant-recovery tank, a low-coolant warning light and extended Vega's engine warranty to 50000 mi to all Vega owners. This proved costly for Chevrolet.|$|E
50|$|VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift {{intelligent}} system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is {{an enhanced}} version of VVT-i that can alter valve lift (and duration) {{as well as}} valve timing. In {{the case of the}} 16 valve 2ZZ-GE, the engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust and featuring two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder. Unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one rocker arm, which is operated by the camshaft. Each rocker arm has a slipper follower mounted to the rocker arm with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the rocker arm. When the engine is operating below 6000-7000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the rocker arm and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the rocker arm. When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> which pushes a sliding pin under the slipper-follower on each rocker arm. The rocker arm is now locked into the slipper-follower's movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda VTEC operation.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> have various uses in automobiles, for example, to warn if the engine´s <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below a safe level, or {{to control}} {{automatic}} transmission torque converter lock-up. Prior to the 1960s, a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{was used in}} the hydraulic braking circuit to control power to the brake lights; more recent automobiles use a switch directly activated by the brake pedal.|$|R
5000|$|It can be {{activated}} by <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> running into a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch,</b> and therefore runs while {{the engine is}} running. Many rental aircraft use this method to remove the incentive to fly with the master electrical switch off.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{varied from}} car to car in {{accordance}} with pilot specifications but also according to engine type used.

50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{monitored}} by an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit, usually mounted to the block of the engine. This {{can either be}} a spring-loaded pressure sensor or an electronic pressure sensor, {{depending on the type}} of sending unit. Problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit or the connections between it and the driver's display can cause abnormal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> readings when <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is perfectly acceptable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is higher}} when {{the engine is}} cold due to the {{increased}} viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of <b>oil.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may be adjustable, {{by moving}} the {{contacts}} or adjusting tension in a counterbalance spring. Industrial <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> may have a calibrated scale and pointer to show the set point of the <b>switch.</b> A <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> will have a differential range around its setpoint in which small changes of pressure do not change {{the state of the}} contacts.

50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip.
