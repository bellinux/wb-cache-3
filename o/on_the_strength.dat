5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated {{in the construction of}} Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when stars were classified from A to Q based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the hydrogen line.

Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E

5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main {{songwriter}} and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a three song demo engineered by Karat Faye, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of that demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, {{a majority of the}} budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, forcing the group to fire the original producer and produce the record themselves.

According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward.

He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons). He also discovered that when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised {{that this was a}} result of nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen {{and a half months}} postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
