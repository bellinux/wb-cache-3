2500|$|Next was Olympic silver {{medalist}} John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 25–0 with 25 knockouts and was ranked {{the number one}} contender by all three major bodies. The fight took place on March 10, 1986 as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>date</b> booked in 1985. Hagler stopped Mugabi in the 11th round of a brutal fight. Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age. [...] He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit. He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes. Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement. Hagler's promoter Bob Arum {{was quoted as saying}} he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Kuidas Spring 1 is a site {{within the}} larger Kuidas Spring Later Stone Age site complex, {{comprising}} a number of stone circles, several cairns and small shelters. Following recent small-scale excavations of a stone circle, rock shelter and cairn, we report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>dates</b> and artefact analyses from the site. We show that the shelter was occupied between ~ 2300 and 1500 years ago, and that people used the circle from ~ 900 years ago until recently. The cairn and most recent use of the circle appear to be roughly contemporary. Analysis of our limited lithic samples reveals both {{similarities and differences between}} the shelter and circle occupations. Small numbers of thin-walled pottery and copper fragments were retrieved from the circle only, while faunal remains from both the shelter and circle are restricted to wild species. Based on these findings, interpretations of changing behaviour over time are premature. It is clear, however, that Kuidas Spring 1 represented an important resource for groups of people living in this arid landscape...|$|R
