5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> ruling must be done by legal methods.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{a future}} {{government}} may <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> statute enforcing property tax rate caps, Daniels {{and other state}} Republican leaders pressed for an amendment to add the new tax limits to the state constitution. The proposed amendment {{was placed on the}} 2010 General election ballot and was a major focus of Daniels' reelection campaign. In November 2010, voters elected to adopt the tax caps into the Indiana Constitution.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> conviction, ruling that the court should not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E

50|$|The bans were {{appealed to}} the Israeli Supreme Court, where <b>the</b> Court {{unanimously}} <b>overturned</b> <b>the</b> bans on the Ta'al list and party leader Ahmad Tibi. <b>The</b> Court also <b>overturned</b> <b>the</b> ban on Balad and party leader Azmi Bishara by a 7-4 majority.|$|R

5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court {{accepted}} this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|Thorne {{then brought}} suit {{in federal court}} to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> discharge; the court ordered his {{reinstatement}} while the case proceeded. After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19, 1998, and he was again discharged.|$|E
5|$|Wychavon District Council {{refused to}} renew the {{gambling}} machine permit for the service area in 1994, under its policy not to allow gambling machines in areas where food was sold to the public.

5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E
5|$|In the November 2, 1880 {{election}} for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who {{was expected to}} win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E
5|$|Pitt is a {{supporter}} of same-sex marriage. In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt {{said that he would}} marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage. In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'— a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage— as Judge Vaughn Walker.|$|E

5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E
5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the {{allegiance}} of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E
5|$|Motorsport racecourses {{and events}} were banned in Switzerland {{following}} the 1955 Le Mans disaster with exception to {{events such as}} Hillclimbing. During this period, the country still produced successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sébastien Buemi, Jo Siffert, Dominique Aegerter, successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu, 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Marcel Fässler and 2015 24 Hours Nürburgring winner Nico Müller. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category. In June 2007 the Swiss National Council, one house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, voted to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> ban, however the other house, the Swiss Council of States rejected the change and the ban remains in place.|$|E
5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union.

Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to <b>overturn</b> <b>the</b> disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
