40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{the most}} common primary brain tumor in adults with {{inevitable}} recurrence after <b>oncotherapy.</b> The insufficient effect of "gold standard" temozolomide-based concomitant radiochemotherapy {{may be due to the}} inability to prevent tumor cell invasion. Peritumoral infiltration depends mainly on the interaction between extracellular matrix (ECM) components and cell membrane receptors. Changes in invasive behaviour after <b>oncotherapy</b> can be evaluated at the molecular level by determining the RNA expression and protein levels of the invasion-related ECM components. The expression of nineteen ECM molecules was determined at both RNA and protein levels in thirty-one GBM samples. Fifteen GBM samples originated from the first surgical procedure on patients before <b>oncotherapy,</b> and sixteen GBM samples were collected at the second surgery due to local recurrence after concomitant chemoirradiation. RNA expressions were measured with qRT-PCR, and protein levels were determined by quantitative analysis of Western blots. Only MMP- 9 RNA transcript level was reduced (p < 0. 05) whereas at protein level, eight molecules showed changes concordant with RNA expression with significant decrease in brevican only. The results suggest that concomitant radiochemotherapy does not have sufficient impact on the expression of invasion-related ECM components of glioblastoma, <b>oncotherapy</b> does not significantly affect its invasive behavior. To avoid the spread of tumors into the brain parenchyma, supplementation of antiproliferative treatment with anti-invasive agents may be worth consideration in <b>oncotherapy</b> for glioblastoma...|$|E

Therefore, the development of new therapeutic technologies, in addition to new anticancer drugs, is necessary for more effective <b>oncotherapy.</b> Oncolytic viruses are one potential new anticancer strategy. Various oncolytic viruses {{have been developed}} for safe and effective <b>oncotherapy.</b> Recently, Sendai virus-based <b>oncotherapy</b> has been reported by several groups, and attention has been drawn to its unique anticancer mechanisms, which are {{different from those of the}} conventional oncolytic viruses that kill cancer cells by cancer cell-selective replication.

40|$|Background Survivin is {{a protein}} that is {{normally}} present only in G 2 and M-phases in somatic cells, however, in cancer cells, it is expressed throughout the cell cycle. A prosurvival factor, survivin {{is both an}} inhibitor of apoptosis and an essential mitotic protein, thus it has attracted much attention as a target for new <b>oncotherapies.</b> Despite its prevalence in cancer, reports of survivin mutations have mostly been restricted to loci within its promoter, which increase the abundance of the protein. To date the only published mutation within the coding sequence is an adenine > guanine substitution in exon 4. This polymorphism, which {{was found in a}} cohort of Korean lung cancer patients, causes a lysine > glutamic acid mutation (K 129 E) in the protein. However, whether it plays a causative role in cancer has not been addressed. Methods Using site directed mutagenesis we recapitulate K 129 E expression in cultured human cells and assess its anti-apoptotic and mitotic activities. Results K 129 E retains its anti-apoptotic activity, but causes errors in mitosis and cytokinesis, which may be linked to its reduced affinity for borealin. Conclusion K 129 E expression can induce genomic instability by introducing mitotic aberrations, thus it may play a causative role in cancer...|$|R

Experiments with deuterium depleted water (30 +/- 5 ppm) revealed that due to D-depletion various tumorous cell lines (PC- 3, human prostate, MDA, human breast, HT- 29, human colon, M 14, human melanoma) required longer time to multiply in vitro. DDW caused tumor regression in xenotransplanted mice (MDA and MCF- 7, human breast, PC- 3) and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Deuterium depleted water (25 +/- 5 ppm) induced complete or partial tumor regression in dogs and cats with spontaneous malignancies, it was registered as anticancer for veterinary use in 1999 (Vetera-DDW- 25 A. U. V., 13 / 99 FVM). The hypodermic preparation of the registered veterinary drug was successfully tested in clinical investigations. Under {{the permission of the}} Hungarian Institute of Pharmacology (No. 5621 / 40 / 95) a randomized, double blind controlled, human Phase II clinical trial with prostate cancer was performed, in compliance with GCP principles, which exhibited {{a significant difference between the}} control and treated groups with respect to the examined parameters, median survival time and the extension of life-span. We suggest that cells are able to regulate the D/H ratio and the changes in the D/H ratio can trigger certain molecular mechanisms having a key role in cell cycle regulation. We suppose that not the shift in the intracellular pH, but the concomitant increase in the D/H ratio is the real trigger for the cells to enter into S phase. The decrease of D concentration can intervene in the signal transduction pathways thus leading to tumor regression.

40|$|Since the {{phenomenon}} was first identified, apoptosis {{has been proposed}} {{to serve as a}} barrier to the development of cancer in metazoans. Over the years, the inability to carry out apoptosis has been implicated in the initiation, formation and progression of tumors. Moreover, acquired resistance to apoptosis is now believed to represent a major obstacle to the successful application of <b>oncotherapies.</b> Caspases {{play a central role in}} the induction and execution of apoptosis. As such, their activity must be tightly regulated. To date, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are the only known intrinsic regulators of caspase function. The present study focused on the identification of molecular targets differentially expressed in normal and cancer cells that could serve to facilitate the rational design of anti-cancer therapies. We hypothesized that variations in the levels of key apoptotic regulators such as caspases, IAPs and their antagonists could conceivably contribute to the acknowledged resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to cytotoxic therapies. Our first specific aim was to derive an expression profile of apoptotic modulator/effector genes in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our analysis uncovered a tendency towards up-regulation of IAP expression (namely cIAP- 2) and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic factors such as caspases and the Xiap antagonist Xaf- 1 in these cell lines. In particular, Xaf 1 protein expression appeared to be completely repressed in neoplastic cell lines. Moreover, over-expression of one or more IAPs was observed in several solid malignancies. Lastly, while Xiap expression and subcellular localization were not altered in evolving intraductal lesions and pancreatic tumors, immunohistological surveys uncovered over-expression and nuclear redistribution of cIAP- 1, cIAP- 2 and survivin in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Our second objective was to determine if differential expression of IAPs influenced the sensitivity of three human pancreatic cancer cell lines to drug-induced apoptosis. In vitro studies uncovered a good correlation between transcriptional up-regulation of IAPs, caspase-dependent cleavage of Xiap, activation of downstream effector caspase- 3 and rapidity of onset of etoposide-induced apoptosis in these cell lines. In particular, endogenous levels of cIAP- 2 mRNA appeared to be good predictors of etoposide-responsiveness. However, attempts at sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to etoposide by down-modulating Xiap expression via over-expression of Xaf- 1 or siRNA-mediated degradation of Xiap were unsuccessful.

40|$|Recently reovirus-based <b>oncotherapy</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} implemented {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer. In this report, we show that apart from its primary direct cancer-killing activity, reovirus <b>oncotherapy</b> overrides tumor-associated immune evasion strategies and confers protective antiprostate cancer immunity. Prostate cancer represents an ideal target for immunotherapies. However, currently available immune interventions fail to induce clinically significant antiprostate cancer immune responses, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with this disease. We show here that during the process of oncolysis, reovirus acts upon prostate cancer cells and initiates proinflammatory cytokines and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule expression. In an immunocompetent transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, reovirus <b>oncotherapy</b> induces the homing of CD 8 + T and NK cells in tumors and the display of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and endows dendritic cells (DCs) with a capacity to successfully present TAAs to tumor-specific CD 8 + T cells. These newly generated immunological events lead to the development of strong antiprostate cancer T cell responses, which restrict the growth of subsequently, implanted syngeneic tumor in an antigen-specific, but reovirus-independent manner. Such reovirus-initiated antiprostate cancer immunity represents a clinically valuable entity that can promote long-term cancer-free health even after discontinuation of the primary <b>oncotherapy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Infertile couples {{including}} {{cancer survivors}} stand {{to benefit from}} gametes differentiated from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem (ES/iPS) cells. It remains challenging to convert human ES/iPS cells into primordial germ-like cells (PGCLCs) en route to obtaining gametes. Considerable success was achieved in 2016 to obtain fertile offspring starting with mouse ES/iPS cells, however the specification of human ES/iPS cells into PGCLCs in vitro is still not achieved. Human ES cells will not yield patient-specific gametes unless and until hES cells are derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (therapeutic cloning) whereas iPS cells retain the residual epigenetic memory of the somatic cells from which they are derived and also harbor genomic and mitochondrial DNA mutations. Thus, {{they may not be}} ideal starting material to produce autologus gametes, especially for aged couples. Pluripotent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) have been reported in adult tissues including gonads, are relatively quiescent in nature, survive <b>oncotherapy</b> and can be detected in aged, non-functional gonads. Being developmentallyÂ equivalent to PGCs (natural precursors to gametes), VSELs spontaneously differentiate into gametes in vitro. It is also being understood that gonadal stem cells niche is compromised by <b>oncotherapy</b> and with age. Improving the gonadal somatic niche could regenerate non-functional gonads from endogenous VSELs to restore fertility.

The underlying mechanisms include inhibiting apoptosis and preserving normal tissue functions. However, aberrant Wnt signaling underlies a wide range of pathologies in humans, and its various components contribute to cancer. Moreover, studies have suggested that Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling may lead to radioresistance of cancer stem cell. These facts markedly complicate any definition of the exact function of the Wnt pathway...|$|E

The AuNRs and Au-rod@pNIPAAm-PEGMA nanogel were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The lower critical solution temperature of the Au-rod@pNIPAAm-PEGMA nanogel could be tuned by changing the molar ratio of NIPAAm/PEGMA. The NIR-mediated drug release behavior of the Au-rod@pNIPAAm-PEGMA nanogel was studied with zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc 4) as a drug model. It was also demonstrated that the loaded ZnPc 4 could keep the capability of generating singlet oxygen, and the in vitro study showed a great photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect on Hela cells. It thus indicated the potential of this Au-rod@pNIPAAm-PEGMA nanogel for application as a drug carrier in PDT, which might make contributions to <b>oncotherapy...</b>|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} {{mechanism by}} which cancer cells parasitize their host is by escaping apoptosis. Thus, selectively facilitating apoptosis is a therapeutic {{mechanism by which}} <b>oncotherapy</b> may prove highly advantageous. One major apoptotic pathway is mediated by Fas ligand (FasL). The death-inducing signaling Ccmplex (DISC) and subsequent death-domain aggregations are created when FasL is bound by its receptor thereby enabling programmed cell death. Conceptually, if {{a better understanding of}} the Fas pathway can be garnered, an oncoselective prodeath therapeutic approach can be tailored. Herein, we propose that EGF and CTGF play essential roles in the regulation of the Fas apoptotic pathway in sarcomas. Tumor and in vitro data suggest viable cells counter the prodeath signal induced by FasL by activating EGF, which in turn induces prosurvival CTGF. The prosurvival attributes of CTGF ultimately predominate over the death-inducing FasL. Cells destined for elimination inhibit this prosurvival response via a presently undefined pathway. This scenario represents a novel role for EGF and CTGF as regulators of the Fas pathway in sarcomas...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{antitumor}} drugs, {{bacterial enzyme}} L-asparaginase has been employed {{as the most}} effective chemotherapeutic agent in pediatric <b>oncotherapy</b> especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Glutaminase free L-asparaginase producing actinomycetes were isolated from soil samples collected from Egypt. Among them, a potential culture, strain NEAE- 119, was selected and identified {{on the basis of}} morphological, cultural, physiological, and biochemical properties together with 16 S rRNA sequence as Streptomyces olivaceus NEAE- 119 and sequencing product (1509 [*]bp) was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number KJ 200342. The optimization of different process parameters for L-asparaginase production by Streptomyces olivaceus NEAE- 119 using Plackett-Burman experimental design and response surface methodology was carried out. Fifteen variables (temperature, pH, incubation time, inoculum size, inoculum age, agitation speed, dextrose, starch, L-asparagine, KNO 3, yeast extract, K 2 HPO 4, MgSO 4 Â· 7 H 2 O, NaCl, and FeSO 4 Â· 7 H 2 O) were screened using Plackett-Burman experimental design. The most positive significant independent variables affecting enzyme production (temperature, inoculum age, and agitation speed) were further optimized by the face-centered central composite design-response surface methodology...|$|E

The spontaneous return of fertility after bone marrow transplantation or heterotopic grafting of cryopreserved ovarian cortical tissue has surprised many, and a possible link with stem cells has been proposed. We have reviewed the available literature on ovarian stem cells in adult mammalian ovaries and presented a model that proposes that the ovary harbors two distinct populations of stem cells, namely, pluripotent, quiescent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), and slightly larger âprogenitor â ovarian germ stem cells (OGSCs). Besides compromising the somatic niche, <b>oncotherapy</b> destroys OGSCs since, like tumor cells, they are actively dividing; however VSELs persist since they are relatively quiescent. BMT or transplanted ovarian cortical tissue may help rejuvenate the ovarian niche, which possibly supports differentiation of persisting VSELs resulting in neo-oogenesis and follicular development responsible for successful pregnancies. Postnatal oogenesis in mammalian ovary from VSELs may be exploited for fertility restoration in cancer survivors including those who were earlier deprived of gametes and/or gonadal tissue cryopreservation options. 1...|$|E
