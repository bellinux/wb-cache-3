In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial {{to the defense of}} St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, after the fall of France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> in'.|$|E

25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect <b>our</b> <b>brains.</b> If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. <b>Our</b> <b>brains</b> sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

500|$|Several {{prominent}} scientists {{working in}} the field of neuroscience supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds {{wrote a letter to the}} editor of The Atlantic in which he reiterated that the brain was [...] "very plastic" [...] — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was [...] "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme". One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, Michael Merzenich, later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was [...] "absolutely no question that <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research strategies that are all about 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'".

40|$|Every day regions within <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> {{facilitate}} us to deliberately select or inhibit planned responses - {{think of}} the right click on a mouse button, or stopping by a traffic light. In the last decade, neurophysiological work has shown that our ability to select or inhibit responses involves both cortical and subcortical regions within <b>our</b> <b>brain.</b> However, in isolation, no single node in the brain can achieve the goal of deliberately initiating or inhibiting a response. I try to inform this discussion by asking how different regions in <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> collaborate (as a network, or system) to initiate or withdraw controlled actions. First, we demonstrate {{that the ability to}} withdraw a planned action relies on the communication between the prefrontal cortex and sub-cortical structures within the basal ganglia. By studying the dynamics of this system, we further show how this inhibitory circuit can be requited in advance when we anticipate the need for stopping in the future. We then proceed by showing how cortical and subcortical regions communicate to select a response, and how this selection can be influenced by the quality of information available in sensory parts of the brain. Think of how reduced visibility in traffic might alter driving behavior. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates how regions within <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> communicate to select or inhibit a response. Moreover, we shed light on how the ‘goal-oriented’ frontal part of <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> communicates with the more "response gating" deeper subcortical structures, to facilitate voluntary goal-oriented behavior...|$|R
