40|$|The {{production}} of enantiopure compounds is of increasing importance for {{applications in the}} domains of pharmaceutical and food-processing industries, as in material sciences. Production of enantiopure compounds has been boosted {{with the construction of}} artificial metalloenzymes. Such catalysts combine the protein environment (bringing some selectivity) and the catalytic activity of metals incorporated into the chiral cavity of a protein. In this work, the system streptavidin-biotin has been used as tool for the generation of new artificial metalloenzymes. To exploit in an intensive way the diversification of streptavidin, nearly 150 mutants (from single and double mutations) have been designed by site-directed and saturation mutagenesis at positions near to the catalytic site. About thirty mutants S 112 X and those exploiting the loop 7 - 8 have been produced on a large scale (10 l) whereas the mutants of saturation K 121 X and L 124 X (single and double) have been obtained by a new fast method (expression in reduced volumes of 50 ml). The advantage of this small volume of expression (50 ml), associated to a short and one stage immobilisation system, is to make possible the simultaneous expression of about thirty different proteins per day. This is to compare with one protein per day on a large scale. This method required the study of parameters such as the temperature, agitation, aeration and extraction, which are known to influence the protein output. This new system constitutes a method of reference for the screening of protein diversity of streptavidin for the evolution of artificial metalloenzymes. The asymmetric reduction of ketones by transfer hydrogenation in the presence of these mutants made it possible to obtain in certain cases chiral alcohols with an optical degree of purity going up to 97 % ee in favour of the enantiomer (R) and 84 % ee in favour of the enantiomer (S). The strong point of the system streptavidin-biotin lies in its potential evolution. The dissociation selectivity-activity has also the advantage of considering several other possible reactions (oxidation, epoxidation, CC coupling) by changing simply the <b>organometallic</b> <b>residue</b> for the designed mutants. The development of these reactions is also an ongoing activity within the group, for which the new mutants and expression protocol described in this thesis will prove useful...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{molecular}} semiconductors {{are subject}} of intense research for their crucial role as {{key components of}} new generation low cost, flexible, and large area electronic devices such as displays, thin-film transistors, solar cells, sensors and logic circuits. In particular, small molecular thienoimide (TI) based materials are emerging as novel multifunctional materials combining a good processability together to ambipolar or n-type charge transport and electroluminescence at the solid state, thus enabling the fabrication of integrated devices like organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and light emitting transistor (OLETs). Given this peculiar combination of characteristics, they also constitute the ideal substrates for fundamental studies on the structure-property relationships in multifunctional molecular systems. In this scenario, this thesis work {{is focused on the}} synthesis of new thienoimide based materials with tunable optical, packing, morphology, charge transport and electroluminescence properties by following a fine molecular tailoring, thus optimizing their performances in device as well as investigating and enabling new applications. Investigation on their structure-property relationships has been carried out and in particular, the effect of different Ï€-conjugated cores (heterocycles, length) and alkyl end chain (shape, length) changes have been studied, obtaining materials with enhanced electron transport capability end electroluminescence suitable for the realization of OFETs and single layer OLETs. Moreover, control on the polymorphic behaviour characterizing thienoimide materials has been reached by synthetic and post-synthetic methodologies, developing multifunctional materials from a single polymorphic compound. Finally, with the aim of synthesizing highly pure materials, simplifying the purification steps and avoiding <b>organometallic</b> <b>residues,</b> procedures based on direct arylation reactions replacing conventional cross-couplings have been investigated and applied to different classes of molecules, bearing thienoimidic core or ends, as well as thiophene and anthracene derivatives, validating this approach as a clean alternative for the synthesis of several molecular materials...|$|R
40|$|Water- gated organic {{thin film}} {{transistors}} (OTFTs) using the hole transporting semiconducting polymer, poly(2, 5 -bis(3 -hexadecylthiophen- 2 -yl) thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene) (PBTTT), show an innate response of their threshold voltage to {{the addition of}} divalent metal cations to the gating water, without deliberately introducing an ion- sensitive component. A similar threshold response is shown for several divalent cations, but is absent for monovalent cations. Response is absent for transistors using the inorganic semiconductor ZnO, or the similar organic semiconductor poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (rrP 3 HT), instead of PBTTT. We assign innate cation sensitivity to <b>residues</b> of the <b>organometallic</b> Pd(0) complex used as catalyst in PBTTT synthesis which bears strong resemblance to typical metal chelating agents. <b>Organometallic</b> Pd(0) <b>residues</b> are absent from ZnO, and also from rrP 3 HT which is polymerised with {{a different type of}} catalyst. However, when Pd(0) complex is deliberately added to rrP 3 HT casting solutions, resulting OTFTs also display threshold response to a divalent cation...|$|R
