5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom.

40|$|Females of Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson), a generalist larval parasitoid, were {{observed}} {{to respond to}} host related odors in a four-arm olfactometer. The females were significantly more responsive to the odors after a brief contact experience with host-damaged leaves contaminated with host by products. During the experience, actual encounters with hosts {{were not required to}} improve subsequent responses to host-related odors. <b>The</b> response to <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant-host complex with which parasitoids had experience was significantly higher than <b>the</b> response to <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> an alternative plant-host complex. This suggests that the experience effect is due, at least partly, to associative learning. We suspect that females of this generalist parasitoid, as was recently found for those of a specialist, recognize specific semiochemicals when they contact frass of suitable host larvae. The parasitoids, subsequently, associate the surrounding odors with <b>the</b> possible presence <b>of</b> hosts, and use these odors as cues in their search for more hosts.

40|$|Herbivore-induced plant {{volatiles}} {{can function}} as indirect defense signals that attract natural enemies of herbivores. Several parasitoids {{are known to}} exploit these plant-provided cues to locate their hosts. One such parasitoid is the generalist Cotesia marginiventris, which is, among others, attracted to maize volatiles induced by caterpillar damage. Maize plants can be induced to produce <b>the</b> same blend <b>of</b> attractive volatiles by treating them with regurgitant of Spodoptera species. We collected and analyzed <b>the</b> regurgitant-induced emissions <b>of</b> two plant species (cowpea and maize) and of eight Mexican maize varieties and found significant differences among their volatile emissions, {{both in terms of}} total quantity and <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blends.

40|$|International audienceThe {{olfactory}} acuity of mice {{allows them to}} discriminate <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> conspecifics differing by a few genes. This acuity is used in habituation procedures where investigation <b>of</b> novel <b>odors</b> by <b>the</b> mouse can be translated into relative difference or similarity between the stimuli. This study adapts these behavioral procedures to address suprapopulation divergence among urinary odors in the house mouse. Specifically, we investigate geographical patterns <b>of</b> <b>odor</b> divergence within and between 2 subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house mouse, Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus, which diverged in allopatry and met secondarily in Europe where they hybridize. Based on M. m. musculus perception, our study suggests that <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 subspecies differ in both allopatric and contact zone populations and that divergence is more marked in the latter. Our earlier studies documented mate preference and signal divergence between the 2 subspecies. Hence, we consider <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urinary <b>odors</b> as mating signals.

This study validates <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> habituation procedures to reconstruct geographical patterns of odorant signal divergence, providing a strong methodological platform to address reproductive character displacement affecting cryptic mating signals in mammals...|$|R

500|$|Another {{example of}} an {{adaptive}} function other than prey immobilization {{is the role of}} viperid venom in allowing the snake to track a prey animal it has bitten, a process known as [...] "prey relocalization." [...] This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. However, this adaptation then requires the snake to track down the bitten animal in order to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. A 2013 study found that western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) responded more actively to mouse carcasses that had been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins. The study concluded that these disintegrin proteins were responsible for allowing the snakes to track their prey, by changing the <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bitten animal.|$|E
