5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony.

Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
40|$|THE {{increasing}} use <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> in {{the human}} dietary necessitates a more complete knowledge {{of the variation in}} the amounts of the different essential components <b>of</b> the <b>egg.</b> Both the poultryman and the consumer are interested in eggs possessing a maximum nutritive value. The poultry man is also devoting his efforts to the production <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> which contain the maximum amounts of the essential elements and compounds required for the development of strong, sturdy chicks. A great deal of work has been done on the variations in the amounts of the organic entities <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> (1). As a result of these investigations it has been definitely established that the vitamin A and vitamin D content <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> can be greatly influenced by the ration of the bird. Work on the varia tion in the amounts of the minor inorganic elements in the egg has been given but little consideration. Elvehjem, Kemmerer, Hart, and Halpin (2) reported that neither the iron nor the copper content <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> can be in creased by feeding additional iron or copper. Unpublished work at this Sta tion confirms these results for iron. The iodine content <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> like that <b>of</b> other natural food products, appears to be variable. Forbes and co-workers (3) found traces <b>of</b> iodine in <b>eggs.</b> Hercus and Roberts (4) were able to increase the iodine content <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> by iodine feeding. Simpson and Strand (5) increased the iodine value <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> from 0. 018 mg. to 0. 754 mg. per 100 gm. <b>of</b> shell-free <b>egg,</b> by progressively increasing the dose of potassium iodide to 8 mg. daily over a period of four months.

40|$|The spatia 1 {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae is {{a function}} of the properties of the ambient water, i. e. the density, current and turbulent diffusion, and of the physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>eggs,</b> i. e. the buoyancy and dimension. The study of the vertical distribution is the first step to understanding the horizontal transport <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae. Two models for the vertical distribution <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> are applied to demonstrate how the physical and biological conditions influence the vertical distribution for the three main categories <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> here defined as pelagic, bathypelagic and bottom eggs. In particular, the physical conditions affecting the distribution <b>of</b> bathypelagic <b>eggs</b> are studied. The wind induced turbulence is the most important ambient factor for the vertical distribution <b>of</b> pelagic <b>eggs</b> and larvae.

5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities.

The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows.

5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of female insects {{consist of a}} pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts.

The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes <b>of</b> <b>egg</b> size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m.
