5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E

After the war ended, Morrison and Robert Serber traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E

5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} and relatively cheap method {{to prevent the}} transmission of cholera {{is the use of}} a folded sari (a long cloth garment) to filter drinking water.

Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{are fairly}} certain that Findláech was ruling before 1014 because the Orkneyinga Saga reads {{that before the}} Battle of Clontarf, Jarl Siguðr of Orkney fought a battle with the Scots, who were led by a Jarl Finnlekr (i.e. Findláech the Mormaer). An Irish princess called Eithne made a banner for Siguðr, which had <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> raven. The saga records that Siguðr later brought the banner to Clontarf, where he was killed. If we believe this, then Findláech would be ruler quite a bit before 1014.|$|E

Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> behaviour known as beach or strand feeding.
