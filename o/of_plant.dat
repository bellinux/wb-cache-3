5|$|George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. (January 6, 1906 – January 19, 2000) was an American {{botanist}} and geneticist who {{is widely}} {{regarded as one of the}} leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century. Stebbins received his Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University in 1931. He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work with E. B. Babcock on the genetic evolution <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> species, and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> evolution incorporating genetics.|$|E
5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train the science <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the}} same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary <b>of</b> <b>Plant</b> Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary <b>of</b> <b>Plant</b> Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
