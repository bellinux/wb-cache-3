5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite behind one of their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind <b>of</b> <b>deal</b> among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament {{ordered that}} {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Sandown and the other castles of the Downs. Fresh earthworks were erected during the Interregnum between Sandown and Deal to address {{with the threat of}} Dutch attack. The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period, with a governor and 21 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> seized Sandown Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Device Forts {{played a}} role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II. The townsfolk <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> seized their local castle in support of William of Orange, and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish {{invasion}} which never materialised. Southsea Castle was held by the King's illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick, who was pressurised into surrendering as his father's cause collapsed. Yarmouth was controlled by Robert Holmes, a supporter of James, but was prevented from actively supporting the loyalist cause by the local inhabitants and his garrison, who sided with William.|$|E

The group was named when Kim Deal started calling herself Tammy Ampersand for fun, and the band Tammy and the Amps. They recorded the album Pacer in Ireland and the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} John Hale {{considered the}} original castle {{to form a}} transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. The design <b>of</b> <b>Deal,</b> like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by the requirement to support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament ordered new {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Walmer and the other castles of the Downs, which were brought back into good order. The garrison at Walmer remained substantial during the period, with a governor, a corporal and 20 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain, lieutenant, porter and 16 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> seized Walmer Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange. By {{the end of the}} century, however, the castle was increasingly regarded as out of date from a military perspective.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis {{complained to}} the British Archaeological Association that more {{needed to be done}} to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion. The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. Deal Castle was in a poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms and coastal erosion, and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors. By 1634, surveys were suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal. Most of the garrison were now living in the town <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> and complaints {{were made by the}} Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night. As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common. Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.|$|E
5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona at the southern end <b>of</b> <b>Deal</b> Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On {{the north side of the}} bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Sandown and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July. An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, which may have been defended by around 150 men each. Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well. The Royalists mounted an attack from the fleet on 10 August, with a second attack following on 15 August, involving a landing of 750 men supported by 50 soldiers from Sandown. Neither operation was successful and Sandown finally surrendered on 5 September, {{a few weeks after the}} surrender <b>of</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|E

Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years.

This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian to act {{with a certain amount of}} independence.
