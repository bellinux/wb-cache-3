5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

5|$|Michael kidnaps Laurie {{and takes}} {{her back to}} their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, {{presenting}} a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2005, a Red Sox fan leaned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> at Fenway Park {{and distracted}} Sheffield {{as he was}} going to field a ball hit by Jason Varitek. After Sheffield took a swing at him with his glove, he threw the ball back into the infield, and then got into a verbal altercation with him. Fan Interference was not called, {{resulting}} in a game tying RBI Triple for Varitek. The fan, a long-time season ticket holder, was not ejected from Fenway Park, but he donated his remaining 2005 season tickets to charity in an effort to avoid any controversy {{for the remainder of the}} season. Sheffield was fined for the incident. Charges were dismissed against both the fan and Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1896 – 1897, the health of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz deteriorated. In the spring, Anastasia took her husband to Grasse {{in the hope that}} the change of {{location}} might initiate a recovery. It was during this time that their eldest daughter, Alexandrine, was engaged to the son of the Danish Crown Prince, who later became King Christian X of Denmark. A few weeks later, at the beginning of April, Anastasia returned with her husband to Villa Wenden. Anticipating the worst, she sent for their son, who was studying in Dresden. On April 10, while the family and household were at dinner, a coachman found Grand Duke Friedrich Franz unconscious at the bottom of the villa's -high retaining wall on the road below the rose-festooned parapet, which encircled the villa's garden. He had jumped in an attempt to end his life. He was carried back to the villa, where he finally died. The official report was that the sick grand duke, gasping for air, had gone to the balcony falling down <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> accidentally.|$|E

500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> and threw up. I'll never forget it. I wiped my face with copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E
500|$|The Octagon House (1799 New York Avenue NW) is {{reported}} to be the most haunted home in D.C. It was built in 1801 by Colonel John Tayloe III. The Tayloes were a greatly distinguished Virginia family: His grandfather, Colonel John Tayloe (d. 1747), {{was a member of the}} King's Council in Virginia and owner of more than [...] of land (a huge estate at the time), and his father, Colonel John Tayloe II, built the historic Mount Airy manor house in 1758 and was also a member of the King's Council. John Tayloe III was a close friend of George Washington's, and Washington convinced Tayloe to build a winter home in the new city of Washington. There is some evidence that the walled back yard of The Octagon itself may have served as a slave market, and it is well-established that the rear of the building housed the Tayloe family's slaves. The Tayloe family was exceptionally well-connected, and their home was an important one in the city. After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the war) there in February 1815. Apparitions and the presence of otherworldly forces have been seen and felt in many places at The Octagon, including on the spiral staircase, the second floor landing, the third floor landing, the third floor bedroom, and the garden area in the rear. Among the eyewitnesses have been members of the public, and curators and other employees hired by the museum which owns the house. Two of Colonel Tayloe's daughters are said to haunt The Octagon. The first allegedly died before the War of 1812. Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase. The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, fell to her death down the stairs (or <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing),</b> and her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} I must confess that I lost that imperturbable sang-froid {{which is the}} admiration of all my friends, and with a genuine oath I flung <b>the</b> case <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> in <b>the</b> wake of the milor's hair and whiskers. Then I hurried home.|$|R

2500|$|In April 1906 it was {{reported}} that a watchman who had been the watchman on Telephone No. 3 for two years was believed to have been drowned. [...] On April 26, 1906 the body of the watchman, William B. Flannigan, was found not far from the steamer. [...] It was surmised from finger marks on the boat's railing that Flannigan had fallen into the river when trying to board the Telephone by climbing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> rather than using the gangway.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{reported}} that Haq began shouting [...] "I'm a Muslim American; I'm angry at Israel" [...] {{before he began}} his shooting spree.

Pamela Waechter received a gunshot in the chest. As the wounded Waechter attempted to flee down a flight of stairs, Haq reached <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and shot her {{for the second time in}} the head, killing her.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the upper}} deck, looking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> {{there was a}} young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round.

2500|$|... "Dmitry {{received}} Yusupov's suggestion with alacrity, and alliance {{was welcomed}} as {{indicating that the}} murder {{would not be a}} demonstration against the dynasty." [...] They had planned to burn Rasputin's possessions and call from the train station a popular restaurant to ask if Rasputin was in. Sukhotin put on Rasputin’s fur coat, his rubber boots and gloves. He left together with Dmitri and Lazovert into Purishkevich's car, suggesting Rasputin had left the palace alive. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots in her small fireplace in Purishkevich's ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the mentioned items. When the body was wrapped in a curtain, the conspirators drove toward Krestovsky Island and, at about 5 a.m., threw the corpse from a bridge into the Malaya Nevka River into an ice hole. They forgot to attach weights so that the body would sink deep, dropped his fur coat <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> with the chains, and drove back, without noticing one of Rasputin's goloshes, a rubber boot (size 10), was stuck between the piles of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The three {{suspects}} {{attended school}} together, and by age 14 found some common ground. [...] "Me and Igor [...] were both afraid of heights, {{and we were}} afraid we'd be beaten up by bullies", Sayenko stated during questioning. Suprunyuk sought advice on getting rid of their fears, which led the boys to stand on a balcony of their 14th floor apartment for hours, hanging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> This reportedly had {{a positive effect on}} their fear of heights. Hanzha was reportedly the most squeamish of the three. He had blood phobia, and even refused to bathe his kitten, afraid he might scald it. Suprunyuk suggested tackling the fears by torturing stray dogs. The boys captured dogs in a wooded area near their house, hanged them from trees, disemboweled them, and took pictures next to the corpses. Prosecution evidence included many of these photos taken by the suspects while underage. Some photos show the boys drawing swastikas and other symbols with animal blood, and giving the Nazi salute. In one photo, Suprunyuk poses sporting a toothbrush moustache, similar to Adolf Hitler's moustache. Suprunyuk was born on April 20, the same day as Hitler, and referred to this fact.|$|E

60|$|Early in {{the small}} hours {{it would seem that}} young Caddles came to the shadowy quiet of Regent's Park, stepped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> and lay down on a grassy slope near where the people skate in winter time, and there he slept an hour or so. And about six o'clock in the morning, he was talking to a draggled woman he had found {{sleeping}} in a ditch near Hampstead Heath, asking her very earnestly what she thought she was for....|$|R
60|$|He walked {{then down}} the street, {{grinning}} and ogling every woman {{he met with}} glances, which he meant should kill them outright, and peered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings,</b> and in at the windows, where females were, in the tranquil summer evening. But Betsy, Mrs. Pybus's maid, shrank back with a Lor bless us, as Alcide ogled her <b>over</b> <b>the</b> laurel-bush; the Miss Bakers, and their mamma, stared with wonder; and presently a crowd began to follow the interesting foreigner, of ragged urchins and children, who left their dirt-pies in the street to pursue him.|$|R

60|$|The Independents shouted {{themselves}} hoarse, {{and flung}} their caps in the air. Talcott had carried {{both of the}} towns of the county; {{he was sure of}} the farmers. The boys howled like savages, and tripped each other <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> and seats, boxed hats, punched the men in the back, and hid around their legs; while the clerk went on with his reading, at more and more frequent intervals, of reports from other States and districts of the congressional field. The old-line Democrats were delirious with joy. The promised land was in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{looked up}} again a man was {{standing}} in his front garden, having apparently {{come out of his}} house; he was leaning <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> and gazing at me. We were all alone on that nightmare road; his face was in shadow; his dress was dark and ordinary; but when I saw him standing so perfectly still I knew somehow that he was not of this world. And the stars behind his head were larger and fiercer than ought to be endured by the eyes of men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{his house}} {{ought to be}} hell!" [...] said the Secretary; [...] "and if it is hell, I'm going in!" [...] and he sprang <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tall <b>railings</b> almost with one swing.|$|R
