5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to ease the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> is to first construct local components and then build a global frame from these. In this paper we will show {{that the study of}} the relation between a frame and its local components leads to the definition <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. We introduce this new notion and prove that it provides us with the link we need. It will also turn out that <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces behave as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>frames.</b> In particular, we can define an analysis, a synthesis and a frame operator for a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, which even yield a reconstruction formula. Also concepts such as completeness, minimality, and exactness are introduced and investigated. We further study several constructions <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, and also <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> and Riesz frames using the theory <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. An important special case are harmonic <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces which generalize harmonic frames. We show that wavelet subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis belong to this class.
