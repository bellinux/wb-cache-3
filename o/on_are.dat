5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder. This becomes clearer when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, father to both Lorenzo the Elder and Cosimo de' Medici.

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take <b>on)</b> <b>are</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet their}} protein {{requirements}} and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, P.furcifer strongly favored preying mantises and moths {{of the family}} Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus Coeloptera, and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed <b>on</b> <b>are</b> high in protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed <b>on</b> <b>are</b> remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|Jennings slowly {{began to}} chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 {{as part of the}} Mob on NBC's 1 vs. 100. A year later, Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by {{defeating}} Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 <b>on</b> <b>Are</b> You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. He extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy! event. Rutter won $200,000 in the challenge, in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity. He then added $100,000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game, raising his total to $3,555,102, second only to Jennings' $3,923,414.29.|$|E

The entries Sakuraba has not worked <b>on</b> <b>are</b> Legendia, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and Innocence, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for Zestiria. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the artists are Garnet Crow (Eternia), Deen (Destiny/Hearts), Kokia (Innocence), Ayumi Hamasaki (Xillia/Xillia 2) and FLOW (Berseria). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with Symphonia, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first western release of a Tales title to feature the theme song used in Japan was Vesperia.|$|E
