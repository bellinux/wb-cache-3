5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the <b>optical</b> <b>axis,</b> while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its <b>optical</b> <b>axis).</b> Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's <b>optical</b> <b>axis</b> will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{in detail}} the spatial {{distribution}} and kinematic properties of two different stellar populations in Andromeda II (And II) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We obtained their detailed surface density maps, together with their radial density profiles. The two populations differ not only in age and metallicity, but also in their spatial distribution and kinematics. Old stars (≳ 11 Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles. These stars rotate around the projected <b>optical</b> major <b>axis</b> of the galaxy with line-of-sight velocities v_los(r_h) = 16 ± 3 km s^- 1 and a velocity gradient of 2. 06 ± 0. 21 km s^- 1 arcmin^- 1. Intermediate-age stars (≲ 9 Gyr) concentrate in {{the centre of the}} galaxy and form an elongated structure extending along the projected <b>optical</b> major <b>axis.</b> This structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of 2. 24 ± 0. 22 km s^- 1 arcmin^- 1, and around the <b>optical</b> minor <b>axis.</b> The centres of rotation and kinetic position angles (PA_ kin) of both populations differ. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PA_ kin = 18 ^∘± 2 ^∘ and for the old ones PA_ kin = 63 ^∘± 3 ^∘ in good agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry.

A transparent cover (6) seals {{the surface of the}} substrate and the deflectable optical elements. An <b>optical</b> main <b>axis</b> of the transparent cover is not perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} substrate. The transparent cover is {{provided with a}} transparent cover element and a frame part. The cover element is configured as a flat, single/multilayer plate, which is preferably non-reflective coated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for producing a micromechanical sensor/actuator component.

Compare these values with that for ordinary window glass, which is only 1.5. The refractive index depends upon the direction of travel of light through the crystal. The maximum birefringence δ {{is the difference between}} the highest and the lowest values. For leadhillite δ = 0.140.An important characteristic of a biaxial material is the angle between the two optic axes, called the optic angle and designated 2V. It is possible to calculate this value from the refractive indices, and also to measure it. For leadhillite both the measured and calculated values of 2V are 10°. When the colour of the incident light is changed the refractive indices change, and so does the value of 2V. This effect is known as dispersion of the optic axes. In leadhillite this effect is strong, with 2V smaller for red light than for violet light (r < v). [...] The mineral may fluoresce yellowish longwave or shortwave ultraviolet light.|$|R

25|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} methods involve recording tilt series {{of a given}} specimen field. This inevitably results in the summation of a high dose of reactive electrons through the sample and the accompanying destruction of fine detail during recording. The technique of low-dose (minimal-dose) imaging is therefore regularly applied to mitigate this effect. Low-dose imaging is performed by deflecting illumination and imaging regions simultaneously away from the <b>optical</b> <b>axis</b> to image an adjacent region to the area to be recorded (the high-dose region). This area is maintained centered during tilting and refocused before recording. During recording the deflections are removed so that the area of interest is exposed to the electron beam only for the duration required for imaging. An improvement of this technique (for objects resting on a sloping substrate film) is to have two symmetrical off-axis regions for focusing followed by setting focus to {{the average of the}} two high-dose focus values before recording the low-dose area of interest.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} that dark-field imaging with the grating interferometer {{can be used to}} extract orientational information of structural details in the sub-micrometer regime beyond the spatial resolution of the detection system. While the scattering of X-rays in a direction perpendicular to the grating lines provides the dark-field contrast, the scattering in a direction parallel to the grating lines only lead to blurring in the image, which is not visible at the low resolution of the detector. This intrinsic physical property of the setup is utilized to extract orientational information about the angular variation of the local scattering power of the sample by rotating the sample around the <b>optical</b> <b>axis</b> of the set-up and collecting a set of several dark-field images, each measuring the component of the scattering perpendicular to the grating lines for that particular orientation.
