5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world {{and give her a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>comfort.</b> Kurosaki was inspired by the film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to wear, and how the main character's bedroom is colored pastel pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1917, the {{day after}} his accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait {{until the end of the}} war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} provide {{adequate}} comforting is valued in close relationships. As a valued commodity, the quality <b>of</b> the <b>comforting</b> that a person provides {{may be used to}} maintain equitable relationships or to balance rewards and costs in close relationships. We examined whether perceptions of equity in dating relationships predicts the quality <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> communication. One hundred and fifteen college students reported their perceptions of equity in their relationships. In addition, they estimated the effort they would expend on comforting their partner in different situations and reported the verbal messages they would use to comfort their partners in a particular scenario. Although molecular measures of equity were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> behavior, global measures were not. Support was found for the use <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> communication as a maintenance and as a balancing mechanism. In addition, the effort that participants reported they would expend in comforting their partner did not mediate the association between equity and comforting quality...|$|R

5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E

She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need <b>of</b> <b>comfort,</b> she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine patients' {{attitudes to}} comforting touch in family practice. DESIGN: A survey was {{designed}} with statements {{and responses to}} proposed scenarios. SETTING: Twenty family practices throughout Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Family practice patients; of 400 surveys distributed, 376 were completed (94 % response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients responded to scenarios on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Results were analyzed using SPSS for DOS. RESULTS: Most patients in this population believed that touch can be comforting (66. 3 %) and healing (57. 9 %). Women were more accepting <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> touch than men in all scenarios. Acceptance <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> touch declined for both sexes as touch became proximal and more intimate. Men and women were more accepting <b>of</b> <b>comforting</b> touch from female doctors. Acceptance <b>of</b> all <b>comforting</b> touch declined markedly if a physician was unfamiliar to a patient, regardless of the physician's sex. CONCLUSION: Most patients surveyed believed touch is comforting and healing and viewed distal touches (on the hand and shoulder) as comforting...|$|R

Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case.

5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings <b>of</b> <b>comfort.</b> For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{relationship}} with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly {{over the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> women. These women were essentially sex slaves, and {{although there is no}} exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment, experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Between 1910–1945, the Japanese government rebuilt Korean infrastructure, introduced over 800,000 Japanese immigrants onto the peninsula, and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the Korean language in schools and force Koreans to adopt Japanese names. With the surrender of Japan and the Axis at the end of WWII in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was once again independent. Despite their historical tensions, in December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology, taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia, but most notably in Japan. Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films, but this was only made possible after the South Korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with Japan that had been in place since 1948. Korean pop cultural products' success in the Japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of Japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music. Korean dramas such as Winter Sonata and Coffee Prince, as well as K-pop artists such as BIGBANG and SHINee are extremely popular with Japanese consumers. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region. Both leaders restated their commitment to solving the comfort women dispute, building positive relations in the region, and pressuring China to be more assertive with North Korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community.|$|E
