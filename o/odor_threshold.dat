The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ethylene oxide is 800 ppm. The <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> is around 500 ppm, so ethylene oxide is imperceptible until concentrations well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using ethylene oxide for processing. Employees' health records must be maintained during employment and after termination of employment for 30 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{measurement}} of odor concentration {{is the most}} widespread method to quantify odors. It is standardized in CEN EN 13725:2003. The method is based on dilution of an odor sample to the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> (the {{point at which the}} odor is only just detectable to 50% of the test panel). The numerical value of the odor concentration is equal to the dilution factor that is necessary to reach the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold.</b> Its unit is the European Odour Unit, OUE. Therefore, the odor concentration at the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> is 1 OUE by definition.|$|E
50|$|One {{favorable}} safety {{aspect is}} that ethyl acrylate has good warning properties; the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> {{is much lower}} than any level of health concern. In other words, the bad odor warns people of ethyl acrylate's presence long before the concentration reaches a level capable of creating a serious health risk. Reports of the exact levels vary somewhat, but, for example, the U.S. E.P.A. reports an <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> of 0.0012 parts per million (ppm), but the E.P.A.'s lowest level of health concern, the Acute Exposure Guideline Level-1 (AEGL-1) is 8.3 ppm, which is almost 7000 times the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>odor</b> {{detection}} <b>threshold</b> is {{the lowest}} concentration of a certain odor compound that is perceivable by the human sense of smell. The threshold of a chemical compound is determined in part by its shape, polarity, partial charges, and molecular mass. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood. As such, <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> cannot be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{irritation}} (pungency) figures prominently {{among the}} symptoms associated with polluted indoor environments. In order {{to separate the}} pungent from the olfactory response, we measured nasal pungency thresholds in subjects lacking olfaction (anosmics) and <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> in normal controls (normosmics) for a homologous series of ketones, and selected secondary and tertiary alcohols and acetates. As seen before for homologous alcohols and acetates, both types of nasal thresholds decreased with increasing carbon chain length. Pungency thresholds decreased exponentially with chain length. For all nonreactive chemicals studied so far, threshold nasal pungency is achieved at a fairly constant percentage of vapor saturation, irrespective of molecular size or chemical functional group. Such a relationship does not hold for <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The outcome for pungency implies an important role for a physical, rather than chemical, interaction with the nasal mucosa...|$|R

40|$|COMETTO-MUÑIZ, J. E., W. S. CAIN, M. H. ABRAHAM AND R. KUMARSINGH. Trigeminal and {{olfactory}} chemosensory {{impact of}} selected terpenes. PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV. In Experiment 1, four normosmics and four anosmics (3 congenital, 1 idiopathic) provided odor and nasal pungency thresholds, respectively, {{for the following}} terpenes: ∆ 3 -carene, p-cymene, linalool, 1, 8 -cineole, and geraniol, plus the structurally-related compound cumene. Additionally, all subjects provided nasal localization (i. e., right/left) and eye irritation thresholds. Trigeminally-mediated thresholds (i. e., nasal pungency, nasal localization, and eye irritation) lay about three orders of magnitude above <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> — which ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 7 ppm. The results implied uniform chemesthetic sensitivity across tasks and sites of impact. In Experiment 2, normosmics and anosmics provided odor and nasal pungency thresholds, respectively, for three pairs of isomeric terpenes: a- and g-terpinene, a- and ß-pinene, and R(+) - and S(-) -limonene. <b>Odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> ranged between 1. 4 and 19 ppm — that is, about {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those of the previous terpenes — with no substantial differences between <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> of members of a pair. Regarding chemesthetic impact, only a-terpinene evoked nasal pungency. The overall outcome suggests comparable trigeminal chemosensitivity between nose and eyes and between normosmics and anosmics, as shown before for homologous n-alcohols. It also lends support to a previously-derived solvation model of the chemesthetic potency of airborne substances, and indicates the likely importance of certain molecular-size restrictions for effective trigeminal impact...|$|R
40|$|Guaiacol and its {{derivatives}} {{are commonly}} found in nature and {{are known for their}} characteristic smoky, clove-like and vanilla-like smells. However, there is no systematic investigation of the smell properties of structurally related guaiacol derivatives. In order to establish a comprehensive database on this olfactorily interesting substance class, <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> in air and odor qualities of guaiacol and its alkylated, alkenylated, and methoxylated derivatives were determined by means of gas chromatography-olfactometry. All compounds elicited characteristic smoky/smoked ham-like, vanilla-like/sweet and/or clove-like smell impressions. The <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the compounds were generally very low, ranging from 0. 00018 to 111 ng/Lair. The lowest thresholds were determined for 5 -methoxyguaiacol and guaiacol, followed by 4 -ethyl- and 4 -vinylguaiacol. Some inter-individual differences in the threshold values between panelists were observed, with highest variation in the individual values of cis- 6 -propenyl-, trans- 6 -propenyl- and 3 -vinylguaiacol. The smell impressions, on the other hand, were quite consistent...|$|R
50|$|Two major {{types of}} flavor {{thresholds}} can be distinguished: the absolute {{and the difference}} <b>threshold.</b> The <b>odor</b> detection <b>threshold</b> and the <b>odor</b> recognition <b>threshold</b> are absolute thresholds; {{the first is the}} minimum concentration at which an odor can be detected without any requirements to identify or recognize the stimulus, while the second is the minimum concentration at which a stimulus can be identified or recognized.|$|R

Its hydrolysis in moist air produces methanethiol, which has a low <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> and a noxious fecal smell.|$|E
5000|$|Alkylpyrazines are {{chemical}} compounds based on pyrazine with different substitution patterns. Some alkylpyrazines are naturally occurring highly aromatic substances which {{often have a}} very low <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> {{and contribute to the}} taste and aroma of various foods including coffee and wines.

40|$|We tested four normosmics {{and four}} anosmics in {{detection}} thresholds for six terpenes commonly found indoors: cumene, p-cymene, delta- 3 -carene, linalool, 1 - 8 cineole, and geraniol. Normosmics provided <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> and anosmics provided nasal pungency thresholds. All subjects provided nasal localization (i. e., right/left nostril) and eye irritation thresholds. Each type of threshold was measured eight times per subject-stimulus combination. Stimuli were presented from squeeze bottles in a two-alternative forced-choice procedure via an ascending method of limits. <b>Odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 0 ppm. Nasal pungency thresholds lay about three {{orders of magnitude}} above <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Nasal localization and eye irritation thresholds did not differ between normosmics and anosmics, and fell close to nasal pungency thresholds. Olfactory thresholds could be obtained for all stimuli in all repetitions using the criterion of five correct choices in a row. Trigeminal thresholds (i. e., pungency, localization, and eye irritation) could be obtained on all repetitions only for some terpenes using that same criterion. Carene and cineol produced nasal pungency and eye irritation on all repetitions. None of the terpenes could be localized on all repetitions, but cineol was localized {{a higher percentage of}} instances than were the other stimuli. At the other extreme, geraniol failed to evoke any of the three trigeminal responses in most instances. Overall, the results indicate that the three trigeminal thresholds produce a uniform view of the potency of these terpenes, with nasal pungency and eye irritation being slightly more sensitive than nasal localization. Furthermore, application of a previously-derived linear solvation energy relationship to the results reinforced the view that physicochemical properties can predict the chemesthetic impact of volatile organic compounds...|$|R
40|$|We tested nasal {{detection}} thresholds for airborne {{chemicals in}} a group of anosmics (i. e., subjects lacking a functional sense of smell) and {{in a group}} of age-, gender-, and smoking-status-matched normosmics (i. e., subjects with normal olfaction). Anosmics provided odor unbiased nasal pungency (irritation) <b>thresholds.</b> Normosmics provided <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Homologous series of alcohols, acetates, and ketones served as stimuli. Eye irritation thresholds were also measured for selected acetates. Most substances evoked pungency (i. e., were detected by the anosmics). All sensory thresholds decreased systematically with carbon chain length. The gap between pungency and odor grew larger with increasing carbon chain length. Pungency thresholds — but not <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> — showed a uniform linear relationship of slope close to unity with saturated vapor concentration, irrespective of chemical functionality or carbon chain length. This suggests that pungency from nonreactive airborne chemicals rests heavily on a relatively unspecific physical interaction with a susceptible biophase. Of relevance to indoor environments, such an interaction opens the possibility for a high degree of sensory addition of pungency from individual components of complex mixtures resulting in noticeable irritation even when each component is at a level well below threshold...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{aldehydes}} {{in a variety of}} environmental situations. Aldehydes generally have a strong odor and are highly irritating to the mucous membranes. Knowledge about odor perception and especially irritation potency in humans is thus essential in risk assessment and regulation, e. g. setting occupational exposure limits. However, data on odor and irritation are lacking or limited for several aldehydes. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the <b>odor</b> and lateralization <b>thresholds</b> of some commonly occurring aldehydes. Acrolein and crotonaldehyde where chosen as they are formed when organic material is heated or burned, e. g. during cigarette smoking. n-Hexanal was also included as it is emitted from wood pellets and fibreboard. To study <b>odor</b> and lateralization <b>thresholds</b> of these aldehydes, a novel, inexpensive olfactometer was designed to enable delivery of reliable and stable test concentrations and thus valid measures of thresholds. The delivery system consists of seven syringe pumps, each connected to a Tedlar bag containing a predefined concentration of the tested aldehyde vapor. To validate the threshold measures, a test-retest was performed with a separate method, namely odor delivery via amber bottles. Twenty healthy naïve individuals were tested. The median <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> of acrolein, crotonaldehyde and hexanal were 17, 0. 8, and 97 ppb, respectively. No lateralization threshold could be identified for acrolein (highest tested concentration was 2 940 ppb in 5 subjects), whereas the medians were 3 and 390 ppb for the latter two. In addition, <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> for n-hexanal were also determined using two methods where similar results were obtained, suggesting that the olfactometer presentation method is valid. We found olfactory detection and lateralization thresholds (except for acrolein) in alliance with, or lower than, previously reported in naïve subjects. The new olfactometer allows better control of presentations timing and vapor concentration...|$|R

50|$|Because the <b>odor</b> <b>threshold</b> for {{ethylene}} oxide varies between 250 and 700 ppm, the gas is already at toxic concentrations {{when it can}} be smelled. Even then, the odor of {{ethylene oxide}} is sweet, aromatic, and can easily be mistaken for the pleasant aroma of diethyl ether, a common laboratory solvent of very low toxicity. In view of these insidious warning properties, continuous electrochemical monitors are standard practice, and it is forbidden to use ethylene oxide to fumigate building interiors in the EU and some other jurisdictions.|$|E

[...] Extreme caution is not due to toxicity, but due to the significant odor and the concern this odor could cause to individuals that might be exposed. The PEL for thiols of most types is 500 ppb, primarily due to reaction of nausea at levels of 2 - 3 ppm. The LC50 of tert-butylthiol is much, much higher.|$|E

These compounds have extremely low <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> and disagreeable smells; a common saying in communities economically dependent on nearby papermills is [...] "Smells like a job" [...] or [...] "Smells like money." ...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{thresholds}} {{were measured}} repeatedly for 11 chemicals in normosmic and anosmic subjects. The stimuli comprised {{the first eight}} members of the series of n-aliphatic alcohols, phenyl ethyl alcohol, pyridine, and menthol. Results showed that anosmics could detect, via pungency, all but phenyl ethyl alcohol reliably. In the aliphatic series, both <b>odor</b> and pungency <b>thresholds</b> declined with chain length {{in a way that}} implied dependence of both in part on phase distribution in the mucosa. <b>Odor</b> <b>thresholds,</b> however, declined more rapidly than pungency thresholds: the ratio of anosmics threshold/normosmics threshold increased from 23 for methanol to 10, 000 for 1 -octanol. The outcome of a scaling experiment employing normosmic subjects indicated that, with the exception of methanol and ethanol, pungency arose when perceived intensity reached a narrowly tuned criterion level. When thresholds were expressed as percentages of saturated vapor - an index of thermodynamic activity - thereby accounting for differences in solubility and in phase distribution in the mucosa among the various stimuli, both <b>odor</b> and pungency <b>thresholds</b> depicted a striking constancy across stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Despite being isomers {{having the}} same citrus-like, floral odor, geraniol, 1, and nerol, 3, show {{different}} <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds.</b> To date, no systematic studies are at hand elucidating the structural features required for their specific odor properties. Therefore, starting from these two basic structures and their corresponding esters, namely, geranyl acetate, 2, and neryl acetate, 4, a total of 12 oxygenated compounds were synthesized and characterized regarding retention indices (RI), mass spectrometric (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. All compounds were individually tested for their odor qualities and <b>odor</b> <b>thresholds</b> in air (OT). Geraniol, the Z-isomer, with an OT of 14 ng/L, {{was found to be}} more potent than its E-isomer, nerol, which has an OT of 60 ng/L. However, 8 -oxoneryl acetate was the most potent derivative within this study, exhibiting an OT of 8. 8 ng/L, whereas 8 -oxonerol was the least potent with an OT of 493 ng/L. Interestingly, the 8 -oxo derivatives smell musty and fatty, whereas the 8 -hydroxy derivatives show odor impressions similar to those of 1 and 3. 8 -Carboxygeraniol was found to be odorless, whereas its E-isomer, 8 -carboxynerol, showed fatty, waxy, and greasy impressions. Overall, we observed that oxygenation on C- 8 affects mainly the odor quality, whereas the E/Z position of the functional group on C- 1 affects the odor potency...|$|R
