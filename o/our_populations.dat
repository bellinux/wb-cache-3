Yet the conduct of drunkards even at home is always matter for anxiety; and at home <b>our</b> <b>populations</b> are not armed from the highest to the lowest with revolvers and repeating rifles, neither do we go on a debauch by the whole townful--and I might rather say, by the whole polity--king, magistrates, police, and army joining in one common scene of drunkenness. It must be thought besides that we were here in barbarous islands, rarely visited, lately and partly civilised. First and last, a really considerable number of whites have perished in the Gilberts, chiefly through their own misconduct; and the natives have displayed in at least one instance a disposition to conceal an accident under a butchery, and leave nothing but dumb bones. This last was the chief consideration against a sudden closing of the bars; the bar-keepers stood in the immediate breach and dealt direct with madmen; too surly a refusal might at any moment precipitate a blow, and the blow might prove the signal for a massacre.|$|E

Each man scrupulously respects the rights of his fellow, and any infraction of those rights rarely or never takes place. In such a community all are nearly equal. There are none of those wide distinctions of education and ignorance, wealth and poverty, master and servant, which are the products of our civilisation; there is none of that widespread division of labour which, while it increases wealth, produces also conflicting interests; there is not that severe competition and struggle for existence, or for wealth, which the dense population of civilised countries inevitably creates. All incitements to great crimes are thus wanting, and petty ones are repressed, partly by the influence of public opinion, but chiefly by that natural sense of justice and of his neighbour's right, {{which seems to be}} in some degree inherent in every race of man. Now, although we have progressed vastly beyond the savage state in intellectual achievements, we have not advanced equally in morals.

40|$|Australia has {{the fastest}} {{population}} growth of major developed countries, and projections show a reduced infrastructure spend per capita, putting huge pressure on major cities. This report reveals: 	Population growth rate has increased above historic trends, {{largely due to}} immigration. 	The ABS predicts population will be around 40 million in 2061 and up to 70 million by 2101. 	Almost {{all of these people}} will live in major cities. 	Australia has the fastest population growth of major developed countries. 	Despite rapid population growth, discussion around population policy and planning is almost non-existent. Summary Since the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000 the population of Australia has grown by 25 per cent. In fact, since the Sydney Olympics, Australia’s population has grown more than the entire population of Sydney at that time. While our political leaders vacillate between being for a ‘big Australia’ or a ‘sustainable population’, data shows that <b>our</b> <b>population</b> growth rate is unaffected by this rhetoric. <b>Our</b> <b>population</b> growth rate is affected to some extent by changing economic fortunes, <b>our</b> <b>population</b> has increased steadily since the second world war. Each year <b>our</b> <b>population</b> increases by around 400, 000 – a new Canberra every year. In the last decade <b>our</b> <b>population</b> growth has increased slightly above historic trends, largely due to migration. Indeed more immigrants came to Australia since 2000 than arrived between 1950 and 1980. Now is the golden age of immigration, as much as the 1950 s and 1960 s were. <b>Our</b> <b>population</b> growth is forecast to continue at similar rates. Based on current trends, the ABS projects that <b>our</b> <b>population</b> will grow to around 40 million in 2061 and depending on migration policies, will grow to between 42 million and 70 million by 2101. Almost all of these people will live in major cities. In 2060 both Melbourne and Sydney are forecast to have larger populations than all of Australia had in 1950. And in 2060 Perth and Brisbane together will have almost the same population as Australia had 100 years before, in 1960. Australia has the fastest population growth in the OECD other than Israel and Luxembourg, which are very different cases and not good comparisons. Australiare very different cases considerably faster than that of Canada, the other great Commonwealth multicultural success story. Under reasonable assumptions of future population growth, Australia could have the same population as Canada by 2090 (about 50 million) and of Italy, a country currently {{two and a half times}} as populous as Australia, by 2100 (about 53 million). Despite <b>our</b> rapid <b>population</b> growth being at historic rates and among the highest in the world, it is all too rarely discussed. Whether this rate of population growth is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ depends on your point of view. More importantly, however, it will depend on how well we plan for <b>our</b> future <b>population.</b> Australia needs serious debate around what <b>our</b> <b>population</b> policy should be and how to plan for <b>our</b> future <b>population...</b>|$|R

40|$|Now {{more than}} ever, {{evidence}} overwhelmingly concludes that our food {{systems are not}} currently working to nourish <b>our</b> <b>populations,</b> ecosystems, economies, or social connectionNow more than ever, evidence overwhelmingly concludes that our food systems are not currently working to nourish <b>our</b> <b>populations,</b> ecosystems, economies, or social connections. Agroecological approaches have been shown as having potential to address many of these problems in the mainstream food system, particularly when combined with concepts of food sovereignty, which localise control, and place producers and consumers at the centre of decision-making (Pretty et al 2006, Chappell and LaValle 2009, Sevilla Guzman and Woodgate 2003). However, knowing the principles and the end goals, while invaluable, is not enough. We need to transition from the food systems we currently have to the food systems we envision for future generations. Where do we begin and who should lead that process? In line with principles of food sovereignty, that transition needs to be led and owned not by outside experts or researchers but by the people most directly affected by and typically excluded from decision making within the current food system (i. e. small- and medium -scale farmers, workers involved in harvesting and food processing, cottage manufacturers and consumers across socioeconomic classes). It must also respond to {{the current level of}} globalisation of our food systems. For example, a decision to localise consumption in one country can greatly affect export-focused producers and economies in another...|$|E
