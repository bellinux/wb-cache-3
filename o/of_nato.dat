5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{suspension}} <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although {{there were some}} violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did not engage in any significant operations {{for the next several}} months. The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> air operations also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.|$|E
5|$|As France was {{not then}} a full member <b>of</b> <b>NATO,</b> joint {{operations}} with British Jaguars were limited in the 1980s. Jaguars from France were dispatched {{to participate in}} several coalition campaigns in the 1990s, from the 1991 Gulf War to the 1999 Kosovo conflict.|$|E

5|$|In 2000–2001 {{several hundred}} {{soldiers}} of the brigade were deployed to Bosnia in support <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> forces seeking to stabilize {{the country in the}} wake of the Bosnian War.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the US {{worked for the}} {{rearmament}} of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership <b>of</b> <b>NATO.</b> In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> {{brought about}} some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside <b>of</b> <b>NATO.</b> Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E
50|$|The Berlin Plus {{agreement}} is the short {{title of a}} comprehensive package of agreements made between NATO and the EU on 16 December 2002.

5|$|A CeSID poll in June 2015 {{conducted}} {{with the support of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) indicated that only 12 percent of those polled supported for NATO membership, down from 25 percent in 2012, and 73 percent were opposed. The minor Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian Renewal Movement remain the most vocal political parties in favor <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> membership. Although Serbia aspires to join the European Union, Serbia may seek to maintain military neutrality, joining neither NATO nor the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).|$|E
5|$|At the Lisbon Conference, {{the members}} <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> agreed {{to appoint a}} Secretary General who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the Atlantic Council.

Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General {{at the suggestion of}} Churchill and Anthony Eden.|$|E

5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series.

5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union {{whether or not the}} Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2016, Stars and Stripes {{reported}} that the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade will deploy 1,750 soldiers to eastern Europe in March 2017, in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve - as part <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> efforts to reassure Eastern Europe {{in the face of}} an assertive Russia in response to Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014. The brigade will arrive with approximately 60 aircraft, including CH-47 Chinooks, UH-60 Blackhawks and medevac helicopters, the brigade will be headquartered in Germany and the brigade’s units will be forward-based at locations in Latvia, Romania and Poland.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{violation}} to {{the no-fly zone}} came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down {{four of the six}} Serb jets over Banja Luka. This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history <b>of</b> <b>NATO.</b> The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.|$|E

5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} the Headquarters is {{composed}} of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries, {{as well as the}} International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states. Non-governmental citizens' groups have also grown up in support <b>of</b> <b>NATO,</b> broadly under the banner of the Atlantic Council/Atlantic Treaty Association movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>NATO</b> evolved {{throughout the}} Cold War and its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 {{as it became}} clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.|$|E
