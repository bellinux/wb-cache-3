However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E

To a solution of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione a sufficient amount of acetic anhydride is added to obtain complete conversion of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione. After completion of the acetylation a fresh sample of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione is added. If the mixture of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione and diacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione thus obtained is incubated, disulphide interchange occurs if a proper catalyst has been added. This interchange {{is evident from the}} appearance of monoacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione. The three compounds involved in this reaction (<b>oxidised</b> glutathione, monoacetyl and diacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione) were readily distinguished by paper electrophoresis at pH 1. 7. Using this method several compounds were tested for their catalysing or inhibiting effect upon disulphide interchange. SH-containing compounds catalyse the reaction, in conformity with literature data; the SH-generating compounds Na 2 SO 3 and KCN also catalyse the reaction, the latter compound being far less efficient than the former one. It was shown by amperometric titration that slow spontaneous disulphide interchange is due to traces of SH compound in the <b>oxidised</b> glutathione preparation.

The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the mechanical behaviour of thermally <b>oxidised</b> commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and commercially pure zirconium (CP-Zr). For this purpose, these two bio-metals were thermally <b>oxidised</b> under the same condition (650 °C for 6 h) and the <b>oxidised</b> specimens were characterised using various analytical and experimental techniques, including oxygen uptake analysis, layer thickness and hardness measurements, scratch tests, dry sliding friction and wear tests and tribocorrosion tests in Ringer’s solution. The results show that under the present thermal oxidation condition, 4 times more oxygen is introduced into CP-Zr than into CP-Ti and the oxide layer produced on CP-Zr is nearly 6 times thicker than that on CP-Ti. Thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Zr possesses a higher hardness, a deeper hardening depth and better scratch resistance than thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Ti. Under dry sliding and tribocorrosion conditions, thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Zr also possesses much better resistance to material removal and a higher load bearing capacity than thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Ti.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} so that the possible effects of thermally-oxidised dietary oil and vitamin E supplementation could be determined on the performance, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defence system and some blood and meat quality traits of broilers. Broilers were fed grower diets containing fresh or <b>oxidised</b> oil, supplemented with and without vitamin E (200 mg/kg) from {{four to six weeks}} of age. Neither <b>oxidised</b> dietary oil nor vitamin E supplementation had any adverse effect on weight gain, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio. However, the broilers that received <b>oxidised</b> oil had lower levels of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the control. The glucose level was neither influenced by <b>oxidised</b> oil nor by vitamin E supplementation. The plasma malondialdehyde level increased slightly in broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil, indicating increased lipid peroxidation. Higher glutathione peroxidise (GSH–Px) activity observed in the broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil suggests greater oxidative stress. Vitamin E supplementation partly depressed GSH–Px activity in broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil. This depression in enzyme activity might be the result of homeostatic compensation. The uric acid concentration was not affected by <b>oxidised</b> oil and vitamin E supplementation. Feeding <b>oxidised</b> oil did not cause a marked discolouration in breast meat.

They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that <b>oxidise</b> hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly <b>oxidise</b> carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E

5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may <b>oxidise</b> cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E

25|$|The early Etrurian {{examples}} merely imitated the red-figure technique. Similar to a {{rare and}} early Attic technique (see Six's technique), the whole vessel was covered with black glossy clay and figures were applied afterwards using mineral colours that would <b>oxidise</b> red or white. Thus, in contrast to contemporary Attic vase painting, the red colour was not achieved by leaving areas unpainted but by adding paint to the black prime layer. Like in black-figure vases, internal detail was not painted on, but incised into the figures. Important representatives of this style include the Praxias Painter and other masters from his workshop in Vulci. In spite of their evident good knowledge of Greek myth and iconography, {{there is no evidence}} to indicate that these painters had immigrated from Attica.

25|$|Flatus (intestinal gas) {{is mostly}} {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the colon. There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive intestinal gas, but this is considered rare. Over 99% {{of the volume of}} flatus is composed of non-smelly gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive intestinal gas that is mostly composed of nitrogen have aerophagia. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of flatus in normal subjects. Methane and hydrogen are flammable, and so flatus containing adequate amounts of these can be ignited. Not all humans produce flatus that contains methane. For example, in one study of the faeces of nine adults, only five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. The prevalence of methane over hydrogen in human farts may correlate with obesity, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as archaea that <b>oxidise</b> hydrogen into methane promote the metabolism's ability to absorb fatty acids from food.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pro-atherogenic and pro-oxidant, <b>oxidised</b> LDL trigger {{adverse effects}} on {{pancreatic}} beta cells, possibly contributing to diabetes progression. Because <b>oxidised</b> LDL diminish the expression of genes regulated by the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), we investigated the involvement of this transcription factor and of oxidative stress in beta cell failure elicited by <b>oxidised</b> LDL. METHODS: Isolated human and rat islets, and insulin-secreting cells were cultured with human native or <b>oxidised</b> LDL or with hydrogen peroxide. The expression of genes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Insulin secretion was monitored by EIA kit. Cell apoptosis was determined by scoring cells displaying pycnotic nuclei. RESULTS: Exposure of beta cell lines and islets to <b>oxidised</b> LDL, but not to native LDL raised the abundance of ICER. Induction of this repressor by the modified LDL compromised the expression of important beta cell genes, including insulin and anti-apoptotic islet brain 1, {{as well as of}} genes coding for key components of the secretory machinery. This led to hampering of insulin production and secretion, and of cell survival. Silencing of this transcription factor by RNA interference restored the expression of its target genes and alleviated beta cell dysfunction and death triggered by <b>oxidised</b> LDL. Induction of ICER was stimulated by oxidative stress, whereas antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine or HDL prevented the rise of ICER elicited by <b>oxidised</b> LDL and restored beta cell functions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Induction of ICER links oxidative stress to beta cell failure caused by <b>oxidised</b> LDL and can be effectively abrogated by antioxidant treatment...|$|R
40|$|The <b>oxidising</b> agent {{effect on}} R-(+) -Limonene epoxide diastereoselectivity using chiral and achiral Jacobsen’s type {{catalysts}} is presented. The type of <b>oxidising</b> agent strongly influences diastereoselectivity. Moderate diastereomeric excesses were {{achieved in the}} presence of <b>oxidising</b> agents prepared in situ but in the absence of catalyst (23 % for DMD and 29 % for O 2 /pivalaldehyde). Similar diastereomeric excesses were obtained with both chiral and achiral catalyst when the <b>oxidising</b> agents were prepared in situ; 56 % and 50 % excesses were obtained when using DMD for the chiral and achiral catalyst (respectively) and 38 % using O 2 /pivalaldehyde for both catalysts. Diastereomeric excesses were not observed in the absence of catalyst when using commercial <b>oxidising</b> agents; the chiral catalyst presented larger diastereomeric excesses than its achiral counterpart: 65 % and 38 % excess using NaOCl for the chi-ral and achiral catalyst, respectively, and 79 % and 39 % using m-CPBA for the chiral and achiral catalyst, respective-ly. This suggests that at least one oxidant species, different from the conventionally accepted (MnV(oxo)), might be in-volved in this catalytic process. A modification of the traditional catalytic cycle is proposed considering the type of o-xidising agent. The catalyst’s chiral centre appears to govern asymmetric induction when commercial <b>oxidising</b> a-gents are used, whereas the R-(+) -Limonene chiral centre appears to govern asymmetric induction {{in the presence of}} in situ-prepared <b>oxidising</b> agents.
