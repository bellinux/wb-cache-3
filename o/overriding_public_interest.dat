He held that the representations made by the Health Authority towards Coughlan and the other patients amounted to an explicit promise that Mardon House would be their home for life. The promise made was a promise to provide care at Mardon House, rather than at various unspecified locations as contended by the Health Authority. To resile from such a promise would amount to unfairness. However, in the case where an <b>overriding</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> demanded, the Health Authority would be justified to break its promise.

The discussions have risen wide in the light of the most recent Court decision in Cartesio case, where contrary to its former tendencies the Court decided not to allow the relocation of a central administration without the company being compulsory dissolved. The author finds out whether seeming “step back” in European integration is justified on the ground of <b>overriding</b> <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> in order to prevent dangerous tendencies developing, e. g. the race to the bottom – company mass migration to the state with the least onerous fiscal charges.

50|$|The Criminal Lawyers' Association (CLA) of Canada {{questioned}} section 23 of the Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act; they desired {{access to}} state records of alleged misconduct by state officials {{in a murder}} trial because {{they were concerned about}} the disparity between the findings at trial and the conclusion of the police investigation. The documents in question were three in number, of which two consisted of privileged legal advice to the Ontario Provincial Police. The CLA claimed that their right in section 2(b) of the Charter overrode section 23. The 76-paragraph judgment by McLachlin CJ and Abella J, with unanimous concurrence, confirmed the constitutionality of section 23, ie, ruled that solicitor-client privilege <b>override</b> the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the Constitutional Court of Colombia has {{understood}} economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) {{from the perspective of}} a traditional theory of rights according to which they are achievements that cannot be <b>overridden</b> by conflicting <b>public</b> <b>interests.</b> As a result, the Court has favored a categorical formula of adjudication according to which judicial activity focuses on the definition of the scope of the right. Competing <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> may be taken into account in order to establish the scope of the right, but once that scope is defined, it cannot be <b>overridden</b> by conflicting <b>public</b> <b>interests.</b> Therefore, the conception of ESCR that the Court of Colombia has adopted differs from the South African conception. The South African Constitutional Court regards ESCR as protective shields against conflicting governmental interests. This theory allows for positions of rights to be balanced against countervailing governmental interests. Given the tensions that these theories of rights and formulas of adjudication create in terms of judicial discretion and democratic debate, some intermediate formulas have been proposed. In the final part of the paper, these proposals are analyzed and some suggestions are made that contribute to the debate.

Tang was widely criticised, by pro-Beijing figures, for breaching the confidentiality rule: Chairman of the DAB, Tam Yiu-chung, said no-one had the right to breach confidentiality rule of ExeCo, for whatever reason. Regina Ip, responsible for the legislation of Article 23, questioned the accuracy and appropriateness of Tang's disclosures, saying that she had [...] "no recollection" [...] that such a comment was made. She also criticised Tang for breaching the confidentiality rule, even should his claim be true. Former Secretary for the Civil Service Joseph Wong also said Tang should be condemned but [...] "Tang must justify the breach based on the principle of public interest" [...] Senior politician and former Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung rebuked Tang, saying: [...] "The CE election should be conducted in a fair, open and just manner ... If the rule is not properly observed and protected, no one will be willing to join the government or say anything during internal meetings in future." [...] Leung added that [...] "running for the CE is not an excuse to breach this important rule. James Tien, whose resignation from the ExCo forced the government to withdraw the Article 23 bill, said that the confidentiality rule should not be <b>overridden</b> by <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> otherwise [...] "the government should just make all Exco meetings public". Pan-democrat politicians urged the government to go public on the facts because the public had the right to know what went on.|$|R

40|$|The {{judgments}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the International Transport Workers’ Federation and Finnish Seamen’s Union v Viking Line ABP and OÜ Viking Line Eesti (hereinafter ‘Viking’), Laval un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareförbundet and Others (hereinafter ‘Laval’), Dirk Rüffert, {{in his capacity}} as liquidator of the assets of Objekt und Bauregie GmbH & Co. KG v Land Niedersachsen (hereinafter ‘Rüffert’), and Commission v. Luxembourg cases have given rise to much criticism. The ECJ has given priority to free movement principles over fundamental collective labour rights. In this contribution, the author analyzes the consequences of these judgments for the collective labour law of the Member States. Some Member States will have to adapt their labour law. It must not be overlooked that the ECJ also offers support for collective labour rights. For the fi rst time, the right to bargain collectively and the right to take industrial action have been recognized as fundamental rights in EU law. Moreover, the ECJ explicitly recognizes that the protection of jobs and employment conditions of workers is an <b>overriding</b> reason of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> which can justify collective actions restricting the fundamental freedoms of the Treaty...|$|R

40|$|In February 2008, FIFA President Sepp Blatter {{announced}} the “ 6 + 5 rule”. The {{effect of the}} rule is that, {{from the start of}} the 2012 / 2013 football season, all clubs will be required to include in their starting teams six players eligible to play for the national team, meaning that a maximum of five “foreign” players can be included in the starting team. Sepp Blatter said in justification of the 6 + 5 rule: "Over the years and decades, by signing more and more foreign players, clubs have gradually lost their identity, first locally and regionally. " This paper will examine the “ 6 + 5 ” rule in order to determine whether it falls within the scope of EU law or whether it could attract exemption on the basis of the “purely sporting” rule introduced by the ECJ in case 36 / 74 Walrave & Koch. It will be argued that, because of the potential implications of the “ 6 + 5 ” rule, it transcends a rule of “purely sporting” interest and therefore falls within the scope of EU law. The paper will then examine the compatibility of the “ 6 + 5 ” rule with relevant provisions of the TFEU. Consideration will in particular be given to the question whether the rule amounts to direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality, which in turn determines whether or not the rule is capable of being justified on the basis of <b>overriding</b> reasons of <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> as in the recent case C- 325 / 08 Olympique Lyonnais. Comparisons will be drawn between the “ 6 + 5 ” rule and UEFA’s “homegrown player” rule. The paper will conclude that the “ 6 + 5 ” rule constitutes an unjustifiable form of direct discrimination and hence prohibited by EU law...|$|R
