30|$|Used papers (<b>old</b> <b>newspaper,</b> <b>old</b> magazine, {{printed papers}} and mixed office waste paper) are an {{unavoidable}} form of domestic waste that keeps on accumulating steadily. Existing {{research into the}} use of treated <b>old</b> <b>newspaper</b> (TNP) as adsorbent for removing heavy metal ions from aqueous solution is extremely limited by Chakravarty et.al., who studied the use of TNP as adsorbent {{for the removal of}} zinc and copper [24, 25]. This work studies the possibility of using <b>old</b> <b>newspaper,</b> a domestic waste, as an alternative low-cost sorbent in the removal of cadmium from aqueous solution and investigates the effect of initial Cd(II) concentration, contact time, dose, and pH on the adsorption process.|$|R

25|$|Papier-mâché was {{introduced}} into Mexico around the 17th {{century as a}} way to make objects for churches with its use most developed in central Mexico. In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade much the way metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper and cardboard used is mostly waste paper, such as <b>old</b> <b>newspapers</b> and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E

It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that type of equipment e.g. VHS format equipment and videos.|$|E

500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out <b>old</b> <b>newspapers</b> and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E

After Principal Skinner returned to his house, he became trapped beneath tons of <b>old</b> <b>newspapers</b> in his garage, and was stuck there for over a week, until {{he was able to}} escape.

2500|$|British {{fish and}} chips were {{originally}} served in a wrapping of <b>old</b> <b>newspapers</b> but this practice has now largely ceased, with plain paper, cardboard, or plastic being used instead. In the United Kingdom, the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations 2003 [...] respectively enact directive 2065/2001/EC, and generally mean that [...] "fish" [...] must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named; so, for example, [...] "cod and chips" [...] now appears on menus rather than the more vague [...] "{{fish and chips}}". In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it cannot be sold merely as [...] "fish and chips".|$|E

'The dairy {{is built}} of rotten box bark—though {{there is plenty}} of good stringy-bark within easy distance—and the {{structure}} looks as if it wants to lie down and is only prevented by three crooked props on the leaning side; more props will soon be needed in the rear for the dairy shows signs of going in that direction. The milk is set in dishes made of kerosene-tins, cut in halves, which are placed on bark shelves fitted round against the walls. The shelves are not level and the dishes are brought to a comparatively horizontal position by means of chips and bits of bark, inserted under the lower side. The milk is covered by soiled sheets of <b>old</b> <b>newspapers</b> supported on sticks laid across the dishes. This protection is necessary, because the box bark in the roof has crumbled away and left fringed holes—also because the fowls roost up there. Sometimes the paper sags, and the cream may have to be scraped off an article on dairy farming.' ...|$|E
