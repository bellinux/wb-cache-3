25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times {{asked a question}} about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," [...] and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: [...] "Get your fucking face <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV.</b> No more briefings, period.

500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he wants to work with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, something almost unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he wants people to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music he wants to make, while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired by everything when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> ..." [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: TV Reurkkeotne) from their 7th album Asura Balbalta.|$|E

2500|$|During a February 28, 2008 {{speech in}} Beaumont, Texas, Obama said, [...] "It's {{not good enough}} for you to say to your child, 'Do good in school,' and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don't check their homework, there is not a book in the house, you've got the video game playing... So turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework.

I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that.

2500|$|In late 1973 Split Ends {{entered the}} New Faces {{television}} talent contest, and {{in preparation for}} their performance they recorded two new Judd-Finn songs: [...] "129" [...] and [...] "Home Sweet Home". Soon after, they also recorded [...] "Sweet Talking Spoon Song", which would become the second single. In the event - and much {{to the dismay of}} the Finn family watching at home - Split Ends finished second-last in the contest. Although this first television appearance was not recorded by TVNZ, the Finn family still have the shaky, silent 8mm b/w home movie footage they shot directly <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> screen and a portion of that was later included in the Split Enz documentary Spellbound. Despite their loss on New Faces, the group made a sufficiently strong impression to secure them a 30-minute concert special for Television New Zealand, which was recorded soon after. Typical of the time, the performances were mimed to pre-recorded backing tracks, so the band put down four more songs including [...] "No Bother To Me", [...] "Malmsbury Villa" [...] and [...] "Spellbound". It was around this time that their group altered its name to the punningly patriotic Split Enz. In November 1973, EMI NZ issued the band's second single, [...] "129" [...] / [...] "Sweet Talking Spoon Song".|$|E
