5|$|Heroes for Sale was {{directed}} by prolific pre-Code director William Wellman and featured silent film star Richard Barthelmess as a World War I veteran cast <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> with a morphine addiction from his hospital stay. In Wild Boys of the Road (1933), the young man played by Frankie Darrow leads a group of dispossessed juvenile drifters who frequently brawl with the police. Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E

According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were {{deployed}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to restore order. Further protests {{were held in}} Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections.

5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to}} be done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the residential towers that {{had served as}} the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E

5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> which does little to combat the issue.|$|E

In contrast, an anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia during the time that the Occupy protests occurred, drew thousands <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Mexico City. The Occupy Movement was almost entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians. By late January 2012, most of the tents were empty and only a few protesters remained outside the Stock Exchange.|$|E
