Two complete sets are cast in an eight-cavity die with a 2000 t cold chamber high pressure die casting machine. The initial die configuration used a sliding core assembly with stationary pins to core a through hole in a thick section of the front cam caps. This configuration resulted in high post machining scrap rates, primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the sliding core assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate. The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover. Density measurements and visual inspection confirmed the substantial improvement in porosity levels in the critical region of the castings. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{reciprocating}} sliding wear {{response of}} two in-situ reinforced-silicon nitride compositions provided by AlliedSignal have been evaluated.

5000|$|In theory, {{the motor}} failure {{on the plane}} could not present a problem because the locking lever {{would not be able}} to close. However, during the {{investigation}} a McDonnell Douglas test rig demonstrated that the entire locking <b>pin</b> <b>operating</b> system was too weak, allowing the handle to be forced closed even with the pins out of the locking holes. This occurred on Flight 96, when the handler forced the handle closed with his knee. In spite of the vent not closing completely, neither the handler nor the engineer considered this to be serious. Although the vent door remained partially open, it closed enough to cause it to [...] "blow shut", and thereby allow pressurization of the cargo hold. Although the handle did not seat the pins entirely, the small amount of motion it managed to cause was enough to press on the warning indicator switch, deactivating the cockpit warning light. It was only the combination of all of these failures that allowed the accident to happen. Yet all of these indicators had a single common point of failure: the mechanical weakness of the locking system that allowed the handle to be moved.|$|R
50|$|The VTEC system {{provides}} the engine with valve timing optimized for both {{low and high}} RPM operations. In basic form, the single barring shaft-lock of a conventional engine is replaced with two profiles: one optimized for low-RPM stability and fuel efficiency, and the other designed to maximize high-RPM power output. The switching operation between the two cam lobes {{is controlled by the}} ECU which takes account of engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, engine speed and throttle position. Using these inputs, the ECU is programmed to switch from the low lift to the high lift cam lobes when the conditions mean that engine output will be improved. At the switch point a solenoid is actuated which allows oil pressure from a spool valve to <b>operate</b> a locking <b>pin</b> which binds the high RPM cam follower to the low RPM ones. From this point on, the valves open and close according to the high-lift profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The switch-over point is variable, between a minimum and maximum point, and is determined by engine load. The switch-down back from high to low RPM cams is set to occur at a lower engine speed than the switch-up (representing a hysteresis cycle) to avoid {{a situation in which the}} engine is asked to operate continuously at or around the switch-over point.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{that allows the}} prediction of the stress-strain distribution in a mixed carbide sphere pac fuel pin during irradiation. The model is coupled with a previously developed model for the thermal behavior of the pin. The one-dimensional (radial at various axial locations) solution is for quasi-steady <b>pin</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. Generalized plane strain is assumed for the fuel and cladding separately so that slip at the fuel-cladding interface can be accommodated. The elasto-plastic equations are solved including elastic-plastic transition and unloading. A finite element solution scheme is used with an incremental approach to linearize the equations. The nonlinear effects of elastic and plastic material property changes are included. Elastic, plastic, creep, swelling, and thermal strains are considered separately in the analysis. The elastic and plastic properties depend on the material properties of the spheres themselves and the geometry of the packed bed. The bed geometry changes during irradiation from a cohesionless random sphere array to a form resembling porous pellet fuel. Analytic expressions are derived for the fuel elastic constants and the yield strength parameters as functions of the bed geometry and the sphere material properties. Good agreement between available experimental data and the analytic prediction is observed. The models used for the fuel creep and swelling are described. The fuel creep strain includes the standard deviatoric component along with a volumetric component to model the fuel densification as the geometry changes. Swelling is based on available correlations. The numerical solution scheme as implemented in the SPECKLE-III code is discussed and results are presented for the simulation of a sphere pac pin irradiation experiment. The code predictions are in good agreement with post-irradiation examination results...|$|R
40|$|How may human agents come {{to trust}} (sophisticated) {{artificial}} agents? At present, since the trust involved is non-normative, {{this would seem}} to be a slow process, depending on the outcomes of the transactions. Some more options may soon become available though. As debated in the literature, humans may meet (ro) bots as they are embedded in an institution. If they happen to trust the institution, they will also trust them to have tried out and tested the machines in their back corridors; as a consequence, they approach the robots involved as being trustworthy (“zones of trust”). Properly speaking, users rely on the overall accountability of the institution. Besides this option we explore some novel ways for trust development: trust becomes normatively laden and thereby the mechanism of exclusive reliance on the normative force of trust (as-if trust) may come into play - the efficacy of which has already been proven for persons meeting face-to-face or over the Internet (virtual trust). For one thing, machines may evolve into moral machines, or machines skilled in the art of deception. While both developments might seem to facilitate proper trust and turn as-if trust into a feasible option, they are hardly to be taken seriously (while being science-fiction, immoral, or both). For another, the new trend in robotics is towards coactivity between human and machine operators in a team (away from making robots as autonomous as possible). Inside the team trust is a necessity for smooth operations. In support of this, humans in particular need to be able to develop and maintain accurate mental models of their machine counterparts. Nevertheless, the trust involved is bound to remain nonnormative. It is argued, though, that excellent opportunities exist to build relations of trust toward outside users who are pondering their reliance on the coactive team. The task of managing this trust has to be allotted to human operators of the team, who <b>operate</b> as linking <b>pin</b> between the outside world and the team. Since the robotic team has now been turned into an anthropomorphic team, users may well develop normative trust towards them; correspondingly, trusting the team in as-if fashion becomes feasible...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{conditions}} such as load and speed of compressors are getting more aggressive to improve efficiency. Also, protection from beneficial surface layers, such as ferrous chlorides, on the critical interfaces is compromised as the refrigerants industry is moving from traditional (CFC/HFC) to environmentally friendly refrigerants. Thus, {{there is a need}} to have a closer look at the critical tribo-contacts and devise ways to make them more robust and wear-resistant. In this work, first of its kind studies were done to evaluate the possibility of using surface texturing for realistic gray cast iron compressor surfaces. Three types of micro-dimple patterns (40 ??m diameter and 10 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 7. 5 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 4 ??m depth) with two area densities of 5 % and 20 % were created on the pin surfaces by the method of laser surface texturing. The results of the controlled tribological experiments with the texture patterns were compared against untextured surfaces under starved lubrication conditions. Under identical conditions of load, the untextured pins failed while all the textured <b>pins</b> <b>operated</b> successfully. In addition, the textured pins survived the entire duration of three hours in durability type studies highlighting their long term usefulness. Selected tests were also done at different sliding speeds, lubricant types and refrigerants and the usefulness of surface texturing at aggressive conditions was realized. For the wear and durability experiments, the beneficial effect of the micro-dimples could be attributed to the lubricant storage ability. A trade-off between the effect of the material pile-ups or bulges around the micro-dimples and the lubricant storage volume of the micro-dimples determined the difference in performance between the texture patterns. In addition, step loading scuffing experiments were done using the texture patterns and the scuffing resistance was found to primarily depend on the lubricant storage ability of the micro-dimples. Even though surface texturing was found to have a positive effect, such behavior needs to be evaluated under specific lubricants and refrigerants, to fully understand the complex phenomena driving the improved performance. Overall, the research work done in this thesis developed new information about the application of surface texturing for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor applications. It was demonstrated successfully that texturing could be applied to compressor surfaces operating under realistic {{conditions such}} as starved lubrication and provide significant tribological benefits...|$|R
40|$|Efficient and {{effective}} cooling of the trailing edges of gas-turbine vanes and blades is challenging {{because there is}} very little space to work with. In this study, CFD simulations based on steady RANS closed by the shear-stress transport turbulence model were performed to study the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped duct for the trailing edge under two operating conditions. One operating condition, referred to as the laboratory condition, where experimental measurements were made, has a Reynolds number at the duct inlet of ReD = 15, 000, coolant inlet temperature of Tinlet = 300 K, wall temperature of Twall = 335 K, a back pressure of Pb = 1 atm. When rotating, the angular speed was Ω = 1, 000 rpm. The other condition, referred to as the engine-relevant condition, has Re D = 150, 000 at the duct inlet, Tinlet = 673 K, Twall = 1, 173 K, and Pb = 25 atm. When rotating, Ω was 3, 600 rpm. ^ The objective is {{to understand the nature of}} the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped cooling passage for the trailing edge that has a combination of ribs and pin fins under rotating and non-rotating conditions with focus on how pin fins and ribs distribute the flow throughout the passage and to understand what features of the flow and heat transfer can or cannot be extrapolated from the laboratory to the engine-relevant operating conditions. ^ When there is no rotation, results obtained show that for both <b>operating</b> conditions, the <b>pin</b> fins minimized the size of the separation bubble when the flow exits the inlet duct into the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct created by the adverse pressure gradient is quite large for the laboratory condition and relatively small for the engine condition. Each rib was found to create two sets of recirculating flows, one just upstream of the rib because of the adverse pressure gradient induced by the rib and one just downstream of the rib because of flow separation from a sharp edge. These recirculating flows spiral from the ribs towards the exit of the L-shaped duct, and the spiraling brings cool fluid from the middle of the passage to the walls. Each pin fin was found to induce a pair of counter-rotating separated regions behind it and has horse-shoe vortices that wrap around it next to the top and bottom walls. The heat transfer is highest just upstream of the each rib, around the pin fins, and when the cooling fluid impinges on walls, and very low in the separated region next to the tip. ^ When there is rotation, Coriolis force creates a pair of counter-rotating vortices that bring the cooler fluid to the trailing wall in the inlet duct. Thus, the trailing wall has higher heat transfer than the leading wall. In the inlet duct, centrifugal buoyancy causes a massive flow separation on the leading wall. In the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct, the centrifugal-buoyancy-induced separation on the leading wall is limited to the region with the ribs, and the separation degenerates into a series of smaller spiraling separation bubbles, one between every set of consecutive ribs. On the leading and trailing walls, the ribs and the pin fins induce the same kind of flows as they did under non-rotating conditions. ^ Because of centrifugal-buoyancy-induced flow separation on the leading face, the heat transfer on the leading wall is 10 - 15 % lower than that on the trailing wall, which is not significant. The adverse effects of centrifugal buoyancy were mitigated because the separation bubbles between the ribs are spiraling from the side wall to the trailing-edge exit and are constantly supplied by new coolant. The heat transfer on the side and back walls is higher near the trailing wall because centrifugal buoyancy directed most of the coolant flow towards the trailing wall. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct essentially disappeared when there is rotation for both the lab and engine-relevant conditions. ...|$|R
