5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game {{was the first in}} which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales.

5|$|In {{parallel}} with his RGS duties Markham served {{as secretary of}} the Hakluyt Society until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour. Nevertheless, this work ran to 22volumes in the society's publications. In 1873 Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese Order of Christ and the Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into the Bronx {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Hill campus.|$|E

5|$|Rose City Park is a {{neighborhood}} and park in northeast Portland. The neighborhood formed in 1907, {{the year of}} the first Portland Rose Festival. The headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> festival are at the Visitors Information Center, also known as the Rose Building. The building was designed by architect John Yeon in 1948 and served as a chamber of commerce office and visitor center, city offices, and a restaurant, as well as the rose festival's headquarters.

Other namesakes include murals depicting roses painted on sides of buildings in Portland, and the private company Rose City Transit, which provided most mass transit service in Portland from 1956 to 1969.|$|E

5|$|The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{had created}} the {{national}} side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem. The white kit worn by the national team {{was taken from the}} kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rose,</b> which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford Pageant is {{an annual}} Rose Queen festival {{held on the}} last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a {{procession}} of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park {{on the day of}} the pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.|$|E
5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with the Rose Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot in the Rose Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared in the Rose Bowl on rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. The relationship was negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opener}} at Virginia, Sanchez threw for a career-best 338 yards, {{completing}} 26 of his 35 passes for three touchdowns and one interception. The Davey O'Brien Foundation named him the O'Brien Quarterback of the Week and his performance garnered early Heisman discussion. The Trojans suffered a stunning 27–21 loss against Oregon State on September 25. By season's end, the Trojans' lone loss {{was enough to}} remove them from contending for the BCS National Title and instead they were {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl against Penn State. The Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions 38–24. Sanchez won the 2009 Rose Bowl Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense; his 413 passing yards ranked second in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl and fourth in Trojan history. With Sanchez starting all thirteen games, the Trojans ended the season 12–1 and ranked number two in the Coaches' Poll and number three in the AP Poll. Sanchez finished the season with 3,207 yards passing, 34 touchdowns, second most in Trojan history, behind Leinart, and 10 interceptions.|$|E
