40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} the interdecadal variation {{by applying the}} statistical change-point analysis to {{the frequency of the}} tropical cyclone (TC) that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula (KP) for the recent 54 years (1951 to 2004) and performed cluster classification of the Korea-landfall TC tracks using a Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCM). First, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interdecadal variation analysis, frequency <b>of</b> TC that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP was largely categorized into three periods: high frequency period from 1951 to 1965, low frequency period from 1966 to 1985, and high frequency period from 1986 to 2004. The cluster analysis result of the Korea-landfall TC tracks produced the optimum number of clusters as four. In more detail, Cluster A refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP starting from East China Sea followed by heading north while Cluster B refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west coast <b>of</b> the Korean Peninsula, also starting from East China Sea followed by heading north. Cluster C refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP moving from mainland China while Cluster D refers to a pattern <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-north region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula, also moving from mainland China...|$|R

5|$|Although it is {{not known}} when Marshall began {{studying}} law, nor who his tutor was, he was practicing as early as 1785. In that year, he discovered a flaw in the original 1774 survey of the town of Frankfort. Due to the flaw, several choice acres <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern part of Frankfort remained unclaimed, and Marshall quickly entered claims for them at the land office. Marshall also gained membership in the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, a Danville-based society dedicated to disseminating information to farmers, mechanics, and other common citizens. He apparently was not accepted for membership in the Danville Political Club, although some sources report that he was accepted as a member after initially being rejected.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E

He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E

Both treaties were advantageous to the United States. In the Spring Wells treaty the tribes ceded a large tract <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.|$|E
5|$|Iaukea married Charlotte Kahaloipua Hanks (1856–1936) on April 7, 1877. They had {{met through}} the acquaintanceship of Charlotte's aunt Uwini Auld and Queen Emma.

Her father was allegedly {{a relative of}} Nancy Hanks, the mother of President Abraham Lincoln, and had settled in Hawaii after his second visit in 1853. A descendant of the Kahaloipua line of chiefs, her genealogy was considered of a higher rank than her husband. Her maternal grandfather was the early Chinese businessman Tyhune (i.e. Wong Tai-hoon), who owned the Tyhune Store in downtown Honolulu from the 1830s to the 1850s and invested in sugar, shipping, merchandise, and liquor sales. She inherited lands in Waikiki and Honolulu from her maternal grandmother Wahinekapu, a Hawaiian chiefess and the daughter or sister of Kahanaumaikai, {{who had been a}} recipient <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Great Māhele. Charlotte served as a lady-in-waiting for Queen Kapiʻolani, and was a close friend of Liliʻuokalani.

5|$|In 1020, King Canute {{elevated}} Roskilde to a bishopric, {{giving it}} high national status. Absalon, the Danish bishop, had a brick church {{built on the}} site of Harald's church in 1170.

As a result of Absalon's influence, many other churches were built in the vicinity, making Roskilde the most important town in Zealand. Coins were minted there from the 11th to the 14th century. In 1150, Sweyn Grathe built a moat around the city. The Roskilde bishops owned large areas <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region including, from 1186, Havn on the Øresund which later became Copenhagen.
