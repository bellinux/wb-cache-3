40|$|Recent {{exhibitions}} have redefined conceptualism as {{a global}} movement that emerged alongside locally situated experiences of national liberation movements, New Left social activism and countercultural world-making. This thesis proposes an art historical term, “conceptual nationalisms,” as {{a contribution to the}} historicization of conceptualism as the movement emerged in Canada and Québec. The term retrospectively describes book-works and magazines produced by an overlapping artistic and literary neo-avant-garde, which evince the symbolic value of print media forms during the post-Centennial period (1967 - 1974). As funding for the arts increased and converged with labour policy in this period, the relationship between state ideology and a conceptualist critique of the art object as a commodity became intrinsically intertwined. Many conceptual book-works and artists’ magazines were produced alongside publications issued by literary small presses, as such, this thesis also recognizes parallels taking place between the linguistic turn in conceptual art and literary movements such as concrete, visual and sound poetry that emphasize the materiality of the signifier in language. This thesis introduces three primary case studies: Roy Kenzie Kiyooka’s "Transcanada Letters" (Talonbooks, 1975); the Image Bank "International Image Exchange Directory" (Talonbooks, 1972), which parallels the publication of the first three issues of General Idea’s "File" magazine (1972 - 1989); and a utopian “linguistic space” produced in the early days <b>of</b> <b>Véhicule</b> Art gallery, with reference to several publications including the magazine, "Médiart" (1971 - 1973), "Quebec underground, 1962 - 1972 (Éditions Médiart, 1973), and Bill Vazan’s "Contacts" (Véhicule Press, 1973). I also refer to two foundational works: Joyce Wieland’s "True Patriot Love/Véritable amour patriotique" (National Gallery of Canada, 1971) and Michael Ondaatje’s long poem, "The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems (House of Anansi, 1970). These case studies draw {{from a wide range of}} interdisciplinary thinkers including art historians, theorists of utopian thought and the creation of counterpublics, and scholars of literature and print culture, with particular reference to the national publics documented through the encyclopedic "History of the Book in Canada" project. Combining visual analysis, bibliographic and archival methods with research-creation, this thesis argues that works of conceptual nationalisms arise from countercultural social scenes where a politics of eros challenged fixed identity dispositions imposed through media, both domestic and imported. Invoking the affective state Herbert Marcuse described at the time as, “polymorphous perversity,” these case studies disidentify with a sense of nationhood based in shared language, blood or territory, relying instead upon the psychological drive of libido as a universalizing biological trait. The visual symbols underpinning national identity are simultaneously internalized and reinvested with an erotic ambiguity that manifests as Romantic irony and self-parody. Borrowing from Marshall McLuhan’s media theory, one could say that these case studies use communications media to produce a “counter-environment” within the nation. As works of conceptual nationalism, they reflexively engage an aesthetic transformation of the social imaginary that constitutes a nation-state...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} control strategy {{that takes into}} account the available resources, location of shelters, accessible data, and the network clearance time. As a result, this approach utilizes officers for guiding traffic because they are an available in any city, they can provide information using mobile devices, and their presence might calm drivers who are more likely to follow orders from policeman than any traffic signal. The proposed technique is based on an algorithm that utilizes a predictive application for estimating the state of traffic. Thus, it also employs a heuristic to evaluate if it is worthy or not to reroute an evacuation exit. To evaluate the new control strategy, a traffic simulator was created. Its implementation is based on the parallel computing to overcome the computational cost of the different modules of the software application. Thus, it provides metrics such as total evacuation time, number of evacuees at shelter for every time step, and the state of intersections during the evacuation. The model was tested in two environments with different distribution <b>of</b> <b>vehicules.</b> The outcomes where compared with those obtained from an uncontrolled environment and those from the random approach.

40|$|There are {{two reasons}} which necessitate an {{immediate}} decision : — One is the indications of the 1982 census, which shows the rapid increase of urban sprawl between the two towns, even {{with a loss of}} 30 000 inhabitants for Marseille. This intermediate urbanization demands better planning and organization of this space and must not be left to whatever comes about through individuals particular needs or desires, at issue is the immediate and obvious disappearance of the open country and natural landscapes of the area. — The other reason which imposes a quick choice is the saturation of the existing routes. The North Freeway has a traffic <b>of</b> 120 000 <b>véhicules</b> for day with a capacity of 90 000. The single way railway line Marseille-Aix is known for its slopes and difficult curves as well as its poor traffic flow. The automobile has a huge place in the heart of Metropolitan Marseille traffic, this is to the detriment of a balanced development of public transportation. The solutions : Elected officials from the « department » or « region » thought of : first, the construction of an « aerotrain », secondly, the railway solution meaning the electrification and the construction of a second way for Marseille-Aix, with an antenna to Plan de Campagne (a large shopping-center) and Marignane (Airport), thirdly, a special bus-line running along the two ways of the Aix-Marseille freeway. These solutions seem to be abandonned now to the profit of a north-coastal highway through the Chaîne de l'Estaque. This would allow for a junction with the highways for Martigues and Paris. As such the traffic of the proposed route would permit better circulation of buses going towards Aix or Marignane. This solution is not perhaps the happiest, nor in the long run the most economic. But in any case {{it seems to be the}} future of transports and urbanization for the present time. Le problème des relations entre Aix et Marseille se pose depuis plus d'un siècle. Le développement de l'urbanisation entre les deux villes rend nécessaire l'amélioration de l'organisation actuelle, en raison de : — la croissance rapide de l'urbanisation entre les deux villes, alors que Marseille même perd près de 30 000 habitants; — la saturation des voies existantes.
