In 1963, she became a cataloguer for the Northwestern University Dental School. She became a research analyst for the American Library Association in 1965, and in 1967 she became director of its Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) upon its foundation.

5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, {{but there is no}} written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E

2500|$|In 1791 the French {{playwright and}} {{political}} activist Olympe de Gouges published <b>the</b> Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman and <b>the</b> Female Citizen, modelled on <b>the</b> Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Man and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizen <b>of</b> 1789. <b>The</b> Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution, {{which had been}} devoted to equality. It states that: [...] "This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> they have lost in society". <b>The</b> Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman and <b>the</b> Female Citizen follows <b>the</b> seventeen articles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Man and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizen point for point and {{has been described by}} Camille Naish as [...] "almost a parody...of the original document". <b>The</b> first article <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Man and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizen proclaims that [...] "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh. Though he {{was made}} a lieutenant-general, both of British and Hanoverian forces, he {{remained}} in England, and, with {{a seat in the}} House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and soon became a leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the party. King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which {{led to the formation of}} the Addington Government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> marital privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children started between <b>the</b> Meiji and Taisho periods. However, {{few studies}} have concentrated on this period when the movement started. Naoomi Tamura is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advocators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children.

5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E
