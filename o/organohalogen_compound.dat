The objective of this work is to study the reactivity of natural organic matter, in surface water intended for drinking, during conventional ptabilisation treatments. At first, some laboratory tests focused on synthetic solutions of humic substances, representative of the organic natural of surface waters. In a second step, the tests involved several samples of water from the dam Zit El Amba which is destined for Azzaba treatment plant. Coagulation-flocculation with aluminum sulphate alone and combined with various adsorbent materials (activated carbon, activated alumina and bentonite) was applied to both synthetic organic solutions as natural waters sampled. It was the same for the chlorination process. The results show that the removal efficiency of atural organic matter by coagulation flocculation with aluminum sulphate is significant, especially if it is combined with different adsorbents.

40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant bacteria {{is a world}} health problem. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, {{is one of the}} most important human pathogens associated with hospital and community-acquired infections. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived compound against MRSA strains. Methods: Thirty clinical MRSA strains were isolated, and three standard MRSA strains were evaluated. The extracellular compounds were purified by vacuum liquid chromatography. Evaluation of antibacterial activity was performed by agar diffusion technique, determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration, curve of growth and viability and scanning electron microscopy. Interaction of an extracellular compound with silver nanoparticle was studied to evaluate antibacterial effect. Results: The F 3 (ethyl acetate) and F 3 d (dichloromethane- ethyl acetate) fractions demonstrated antibacterial activity against the MRSA strains. Phenazine- 1 -carboxamide was identified and purified from the F 3 d fraction and demonstrated slight antibacterial activity against MRSA, and synergic effect when combined with silver nanoparticles produced by Fusarium oxysporum. <b>Organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> was purified from this fraction showing high antibacterial effect. Using scanning electron microscopy, we show that the F 3 d fraction caused morphological changes to the cell wall of the MRSA strains. Conclusions: These results suggest that P. aeruginosa-produced compounds such as phenazines have inhibitory effects against MRSA and may be a good alternative treatment to control infections caused by MRSA...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of studies of anthropogenic pollutants in East Greenland polar bears over the period of 1999 - 2011. East Greenland polar bears {{are among the most}} polluted species, not just in the Arctic but globally, and represent an excellent biomonitoring species for levels and effects of global pollution in an apex predator. Therefore, an international multidisciplinary team joined to monitor and assess the patterns and concentrations of contaminants and their potential negative impact on polar bears. The review showed that East Greenland polar bears are exposed to a mix of chlorinated, brominated and fluorinated organic compounds as well as mercury which are all known to have endocrine, immune and organ-system toxic properties. For example, the concentrations of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in blubber ranged approximately 800 - 21, 000 ng/g lw while mercury concentrations in liver and kidney ranged 0. 1 - 50 μg/g ww. Regarding health endpoints, bone density seemed to decrease as a function of time and OHC (<b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound)</b> concentrations and further T-score for adult males indicated risk for osteoporosis [...] The size of sexual organs decreased with increasing OHC concentrations.

40|$|Background: Humans, {{independent}} {{on where}} they live, are exposed to complex and various mixtures of chemicals, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The variability of the exposure depends on sources of the chemicals and is influenced by e. g. geography, social and cultural heritage. While exposures to POPs are frequently studied in populations from developed industrial countries, very little is known on levels and trends of POPs in developing countries, especially in Africa. Objectives: The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate levels and temporal trends of POPs in adults from Guinea-Bissau. Methods: Serum samples were obtained from an open cohort of police officers in Guinea-Bissau. Repeated samples from 33 individuals were obtained at five time points between 1990 and 2007, in all 147 samples. Pooled serum samples were extracted and cleaned-up prior to analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The concentration of 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane (4, 4 '-DDT) and its metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were determined. Results: The major POP found in all samples was 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) ethene (4, 4 '-DDE) followed by 4, 4 '-DDT. 4, 4 '-DDE, 4, 4 '-DDT, PCBs and beta- and gamma-HCH were significantly decreasing over time. The PBDEs were found at low concentrations, with an increasing temporal trend for BDE- 153. Conclusion: National and international management may be behind the observed decreased <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> concentrations in humans from Guinea-Bissau from the early 1990 's and onwards, similarly to the development of these compounds in humans from industrial countries. In contrast, PBDEs follow a trend of increasing concentrations even though at low levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Enzymes catalyzing the {{conversion}} of organohalogen compounds are useful in the chemical industry and environmental technology. Here we report the occurrence of a new reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (FADH 2) -dependent enzyme that catalyzes the removal of a halogen atom from an unsaturated aliphatic <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> {{by the addition of}} a water molecule to the substrate. A soil bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain YL, inducibly produced a protein named Caa 67 YL when the cells were grown on 2 -chloroacrylate (2 -CAA). The caa 67 YL gene encoded a protein of 547 amino acid residues (Mr of 59, 301), which shared weak but significant sequence similarity with various flavoenzymes and contained a nucleotide-binding motif. We found that 2 -CAA is converted into pyruvate when the reaction was carried out with purified Caa 67 YL in the presence of FAD and a reducing agent [NAD(P) H or sodium dithionite] under anaerobic conditions. The reducing agent was not stoichiometrically consumed during this reaction, suggesting that FADH 2 is conserved by regeneration in the catalytic cycle. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of H 218 O, [18 O]pyruvate was produced. These results indicate that Caa 67 YL catalyzes the hydration of 2 -CAA to form 2 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropionate, which is chemically unstable and probably spontaneously dechlorinated to form pyruvate. 2 -Bromoacrylate, but not other 2 -CAA analogs such as acrylate and methacrylate, served as the substrate of Caa 67 YL. Thus, we named this new enzyme 2 -haloacrylate hydratase. The enzyme is very unusual in that it requires the reduced form of FAD for hydration, which involves no net change in the redox state of the coenzyme or substrate...|$|E
40|$|The well {{established}} risk assessment COMMPS methodology (Fraunhofer Institut, Schmallenberg, Germany) developed at a European basin scale to identify priority pollutants {{based on their}} exposure and effects, has been applied at a local scale along a double step process: (a) first, the corresponding adapted list of priority pollutants has been obtained from monitoring data at a regional scale; (b) second, a new site pollution risk index has been developed for the relative comparison of the chemical pollution status of the investigated geographical region. As a case study, representative of the Mediterranean area, {{the process has been}} applied to 17 Catalan rivers (NE Spain), using the monitoring data collected between 1997 and 2006 in 207 different sampling sites. After an appropriate selection procedure, 52 parameters were finally used for the calculation of the local priority substance and site risk indexes. From the exposure point of view the most relevant substances at the Catalan scale were volatile organohalogen compounds (VOX) and volatile aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene and xylene), whereas the priority substance risk index points to dibromomethane (volatile <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound)</b> and benzo-a-anthracene (PAH) as the most concerning compounds. The local and European priority substance indexes have been compared, showing minor differences. Finally, site risk indexes have been calculated and utilized for comparison of the chemical status of different sites. They can be conveniently displayed in quality geographical maps and are considered a valuable tool for the environmental management and risk assessment of the region under study.

Among them, due to their long-term health effects, one should pay attention on organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs). This paper is an attempt to answer the question about relation between the fact of cohabitation by couples expecting a child and the level of the <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in the blood serum of both parents. The study was done on a population of parent couples from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine, from whom blood samples were collected in order to establish the levels of marker <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds.</b> We selected, as the representative of these compounds, the most persistent metabolite of DDT, i. e. p,p'-DDE, the most frequently detected PCB congener - CB- 153, and PFOS and PFOA as the representatives of PFASs. The results show that in case of all compounds under study the highest concentrations were present always in men in relation to the levels detected in the blood serum of their female partners, regardless of the country of origin of the couple. A positive correlation was noted between the concentrations of the studied compounds in the blood serum {{of men and women in}} parenting couples. In some cases these correlations were statistically significant, e. g. for concentrations of p,p'-DDE in pairs from Greenland and Ukraine, of CB- 153 in pairs from Poland and Ukraine, and of PFOS for parents from Greenland and Poland, while for PFOA - only for couples from Greenland. The concentrations of the compounds included in the study were similar to the levels found in general population in other countries. Our results show that the exposure to POPs resulting from cohabitation plays a role in the general exposure to these compounds...|$|R
40|$|A {{baseline}} for persistent <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> (POC) accumulation in the Antarctic keystone species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) {{has been}} established for a 50 ° longitudinal range of the eastern Antarctic sector. Samples of adult krill, caught from 12 sites distributed between 30 ° and 80 °E (60 – 70 °S), were analysed for N 100 organohalogen compounds including chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated organic compounds and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs). Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified. Krill HCB concentrations were comparable to those detected at this trophic level in both the Arctic and temperatenorthwestAtlantic, lendingsupport for thehypothesis thatHCB will approachglobal equilibriumat a faster rate than other POCs. Para, para′-dichlorodiphenylethene (p,p′-DDE) was detected at notable concentrations. Measurements of DDT and its degradation products provide an important baseline for monitoring the temporal and geographical influence of renewed, DDT usage for malaria-control in affected southern hemisphere countries. In contrast to the Arctic, PCBs did not feature prominently in contaminant burdens of Antarctic krill. Themajor commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners - 99 and - 47 were quantified at lowbackground levelswith clear concentration spikes observed at around 70 °E, {{in the vicinity of}} modern, active research stations. The likelihood that local anthropogenic activities are supplementing low PBDE levels, delivered otherwise primarily via long range environmental transport, is discussed. The suspected naturally occurring brominated organic compound, 2, 4, 6 -tribromoanisole (TBA), was a ubiquitous contaminant in all samples whereas the only PCDD/Fs quantifiable were trace levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 / 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 -hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF).

We determined {{if there are}} regional differences in mother's milk levels of these compounds in Sweden. In year 2000 - 2004, milk was sampled from 204 randomly recruited primiparas from four regions of Sweden. Levels of the compounds were measured by gas chromatography with dual electron-capture detectors. Women were recruited at delivery in three hospitals located in urban areas in southern and central Sweden (Lund, Gothenburg and Uppsala), and in one hospital located in a more rural area in northern Sweden (Lycksele). Information about dietary habits and medical/life-style factors were collected by questionnaires. Among PCB congeners, CB 153, CB 138 and CB 180 showed the highest median concentrations (18 - 48 ng/g mother's milk lipid), whereas more than 50 % of the women had CB 52, CB 101, CB 114, and CB 157 levels below the LOQ (0. 3 - 1. 5 ng/g lipid). Median p,p'-DDE levels were {{in the range of}} 46 - 78 ng/g lipid. BDE 47 showed the highest median concentrations (1 - 2 ng/g lipid) among the brominated compounds, whereas more than 50 % of the women had levels of BDE 28, BDE 66, BDE 138, BDE 154, and HBCD below the LOQ (0. 05 - 0. 10 ng/g lipid). Regional differences in median <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> concentrations were small, less than 2 -fold. Lycksele women generally had the lowest levels of Sigma mono-and Sigma di-ortho PCBs, mainly due to a lower average age. In contrast, these women had higher tetra- to penta-brominated PBDE levels, but no diet or life-style factor could explain this finding. Wide ranges of PBDEs and HBCD levels (up to 200 -fold) were found, especially in the Lycksele area. The highest levels of PBDE were in the range of average levels found in mother's milk from North America, suggesting that food may not be the only source of {{exposure to}} PBDEs among some individuals.

40|$|The Arctic and sub-Arctic {{region of}} the North Atlantic is a remote area, also in {{relations}} to environmental contaminants, such as POPs, BFRs and last but not least, PFCs. Both the BFRs and PFCs are considered emerging pollutants of significant environmental concern. The main objective of this thesis {{is to increase the}} knowledge and understanding of <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound</b> distribution in the Nordic environment, their occurrence in biota and change over time. The temporal change of environmental contaminants in the Baltic Sea was monitored over the years 1971 to 2001, with emphasis on BCPS. Further, the pollution profile of the Nordic region was investigated by using common guillemot eggs. Further, to investigate a single remote site, Iceland, in more depth, eggs from seven marine bird species were collected and analysed. Both the organohalogen compounds mentioned above and their metabolites were investigated. The study focused also on an inter-species difference in the bird’s capability of metabolising xenobiotics. All environmental pollutants investigated in the Baltic Sea show decreasing levels over the time period investigated. BCPS showed a remarkably small change over time compared to other compounds. These results reinforce the previous findings, indicating the North Atlantic as remote where the concentrations of the organohalogens are lower compared to Europe in general. There are some exceptions however; the concentration of HCB is ubiquitously distributed across the study area. Further, the spatial trends of the PFCs are complicated and differ within the PFC group. When comparing bird species from Iceland, the concentration of organohalogens mainly depends on trophic level, while migration seems to contribute to a lesser extent. There are some similarities in the metabolism between the bird species investigated. However, the guillemot seems to distinguish itself from other marine birds, with a different composition of metabolites, indicating a different metabolic capacity. In conclusion, even human populations living in remote areas need to minimise the release of pollutants to the environment. Long term, well organised, and extensive governmental monitoring programs are highly recommended to follow the quality the environment and to detect any immediate and/or new threats of chemical pollutants...|$|E

East Greenland polar bears {{are among the most}} polluted species, not just in the Arctic but globally, and represent an excellent biomonitoring species for levels and effects of global pollution in an apex predator. Therefore, an international multidisciplinary team joined to monitor and assess the patterns and concentrations of contaminants and their potential negative impact on polar bears. The review showed that East Greenland polar bears are exposed to a mix of chlorinated, brominated and fluorinated organic compounds as well as mercury which are all known to have endocrine, immune and organ-system toxic properties. For example, the concentrations of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in blubber ranged approximately 800 - 21, 000 ng/g lw while mercury concentrations in liver and kidney ranged 0. 1 - 50 μg/g ww. Regarding health endpoints, bone density seemed to decrease as a function of time and OHC (<b>organohalogen</b> <b>compound)</b> concentrations and further T-score for adult males indicated risk for osteoporosis.. The size of sexual organs decreased with increasing OHC concentrations. In the lower brain stem, mercury-associated decreases in NMDA-receptor levels and DNA-methylation was found The present review indicated that age was one of the major drivers for liver and renal lesions, although contaminants and infectious diseases may also play a role. Lesions in thyroid glands were most likely a result of infectious and genetic factors and probably, together with endocrine disrupting chemical (EDCs), the reason for disturbances/fluctuations in blood plasma thyroid hormone concentrations. Except for bone density reductions and neurological measures, all findings were supported by case-control studies of Greenland sledge dogs exposed long-term orally to similar combinations of contaminant concentrations. The studies of sledge dogs also indicated that the mixture of contaminants and fatty acids in the blubber of prey similar to that of polar bears induces cellular as well as humoral immune toxic changes. These controlled studies using model species for polar bears indicate that the correlative findings between health endpoint and contaminants in polar bears could be a cause-and-effect relationship. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling showed that the risk quotients were ≥ 1 for ΣPCB, dieldrin and PFOS, which indicate an increased risk of prenatally reproductive pathology. In conclusion polar bears are susceptible to long-range transported chemicals that may have various adverse effects on multiple organ systems such as the reproductive and immune system. </p...|$|E

DDTs were the most abundant contaminants followed by PCBs, CHLs, HCHs, PBDEs, HBCDs, and HCB. BFR levels found in Baikal seals were lower than those in other marine mammals from European or American coastal waters, implying that seals in this region were less exposed to BFRs. This {{suggests that there is}} no heavy industry producing or using BFRs in the watershed of Lake Baikal and the contamination might have resulted from long-range atmospheric transport. Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCDs in the blubber of Baikal seals collected in 2005 were significantly higher in males than in females. This gender dependent difference could be due to transfer of these contaminants from mother to pup during gestation and lactation. In addition, temporal trends of organohalogen contamination in Baikal seals were investigated using the blubber of male juvenile seals collected in 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2005.

To obtain systematic data, we collected in 2000 maternal and cord blood, cord tissue, placenta, and milk in connection with births in the Faroe Islands, where exposures to marine contaminants is increased. In 15 sample sets, we measured a total of 87 environmental chemicals, almost all of which were detected both in maternal and fetal tissues. The maternal serum lipid-based concentrations of <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> averaged 1. 7 times those of cord serum, 2. 8 times those of cord tissue and placenta, and 0. 7 those of milk.

Perfluorinated compounds occurred in lower concentrations in cord serum than in maternal serum.

Obj e c t i v e: We investigated the influence of prenatal exposure to OHCs, including brominated flame retardants, on motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcome in healthy children of school age. Met h o d s: This study was part of the prospective Groningen infant COMPARE (Comparison of Exposure-Effect Pathways to Improve the Assessment of Human Health Risks of Complex Environmental Mixtures of Organohalogens) study. It included 62 children in whose mothers the following compounds had been determined in the 35 th week of pregnancy: 2, 2 ´-bis-(4 chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 ´-dichloroethene, pentachlorophenol (PCP), polychlorinated biphenyl congener 153 (PCB- 153) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} general anesthesia {{is still a}} controversial issue. Direct effect by linking of anesthetics to proteins and indirect action on the lipid membrane properties are the two hypotheses in conflict. Atomistic simulations of different lipid membranes subjected {{to the effect of}} small volatile <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> are used to explore plausible lipid-mediated mechanisms. Simulations of homogeneous membranes reveal that electrostatic potential and lateral pressure transversal profiles are affected differently by chloroform (anesthetic) and carbon tetrachloride (non-anesthetic). Simulations of structured membranes that combine ordered and disordered regions show that chloroform molecules accumulate preferentially in highly disordered lipid domains, suggesting that the combination of both lateral and transversal partitioning of chloroform in the cell membrane could be responsible of its anesthetic action...|$|R
50|$|The {{ozone layer}} can be {{depleted}} by free radical catalysts, including nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydroxyl (OH), atomic chlorine (Cl), and atomic bromine (Br). While there are natural sources {{for all of}} these species, the concentrations of chlorine and bromine increased markedly in recent decades because of the release of large quantities of man-made <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons. These highly stable compounds are capable of surviving the rise to the stratosphere, where Cl and Br radicals are liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Each radical is then free to initiate and catalyze a chain reaction capable of breaking down over 100,000 ozone molecules. By 2009, nitrous oxide was the largest ozone-depleting substance (ODS) emitted through human activities.|$|R
40|$|<b>Organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are some}} of the most notorious {{persistent}} pollutants disturbing the Earth biosphere. Although human-made, these chemicals are not completely alien to living systems. A large number of natural organohalogens, part of the secondary metabolism, are involved in chemical trophic interactions. Surprisingly, the relationship between organisms' trophic position and synthetic organohalogen biotransformation capability has not been investigated. We studied the case for polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDE), a group of flame-retardants of widespread use in the recent years, in aquatic food webs from remote mountain lakes. These relatively simple ecosystems only receive pollution by atmospheric transport. A large predominance of the PBDE congener currently in use in Europe, BDE- 209, largely dominated the PBDE composition of the basal resources of the food web. In contrast, primary consumers (herbivores and detritivores) showed a low proportion of BDE- 209, and dominance of several less brominated congeners (e. g. BDE- 100, BDE 47). Secondary consumers (predators) showed large biomagnification of BDE- 209 compare to other congeners. Finally, top predator fish characterized by low total PBDE concentrations. Examination of the bromine stable isotopic composition indicates that primary consumers showed higher PBDE biotransformation capability than secondary consumers. We suggest that the evolutionary response of primary consumers to feeding deterrents would have pre-adapted them for PBDE biotransformation. The observed few exceptions, some insect taxa, can be interpreted in the light of the trophic history of the evolutionary lineage of the organisms. Bromine isotopic composition in fish indicates that low PBDE values are due to not only biotransformation but also to some other process likely related to transport. Our finding illustrates that <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> may strongly disturb ecosystems even at low concentrations, since the species lacking or having scarce biotransformation capability may be selectively more exposed to these halogenated hydrophobic semi-volatile organic pollutants due to their high bioaccumulation potential...|$|R
50|$|The {{phosphate}} mines {{are situated}} near Palmyra and are transported and disposed of in an irresponsible manner. The waste from the mines is dumped near the Mediterranean Sea, and the pollution {{produced by the}} mining industry {{has contributed to the}} Mediterranean Sea's deteriorating state. The perpetuation of the Syria’s pollution has not only affected Syria’s environment, and its people, but has made its way into neighbouring regions. It has affected Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Monaco, Morocco, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, Spain, Tunisia, and Turkey. The pollution that is inflicted on the Mediterranean Sea are land-based such as sewage and urban run-off, urban solid wastes, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> radioactive substances, nutrients, suspended solids, and hazardous wastes.|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated and {{brominated}} compounds {{belong to}} the class of <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> that have received attention because of their widespread occurrence, use and applications. Understanding the sources and transformation processes of these contaminants in the environment enables assessment of their possible impact on humans and ecosystems. Recently new and innovative methods of Compound Specific Isotope Analysis have started {{to be applied to}} characterize the origin and fate of compounds, their breakdown products and degradation rates in different environmental compartments. Almost all studies have focussed on determination of isotopes of C and H, only recently new methodologies have been developed to measure isotopes of Cl and Br. This review firstly gives a brief description of chemistry properties and geochemical cycle of chlorine and bromine followed by a summary of their uses and applications. In the second section, an overview of CSIA techniques and new challenges and successful applications are also presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> such as {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) {{belong to the}} group of {{persistent}} compounds, implying that they are slowly biodegradable and accumulate in the environment. A new group of possibly persistent compounds are the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These PBDEs have recently been identified in the environment, and their toxicity is relatively unknown. PBDEs are used extensively as flame retardants in e. g. computers, tv-sets, or textile. In this thesis, the toxicity of PBDEs is described. In vitro experiments revealed that PBDEs are able to bind to transthyretin (TTR), a thyroid hormone transport protein, and can exert estrogenic activity. In vivo experiments with a model compound showed that these substances can have adverse effects on brain development and the estrous cycle in offspring of rats exposed in utero. The concentrations that gave rise to these effects in the rats are only one order of magnitude higher than the concentrations in which these compounds are currently present in human blood...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> have been attracting {{a great deal of}} attention, partly because of their possible applications in environmental technology and the chemical industry. We have studied the mechanisms of enzymatic degradation of various organic halo acids. In the reaction of L- 2 -haloacid dehalogenase and fluoroacetate dehalogenase, the carboxylate group of the catalytic aspartate residue nucleophilically attacked the α-carbon atom of the substrates to displace the halogen atom. In the reaction catalyzed by DL- 2 -haloacid dehalogenase, a water molecule directly attacked the substrate to displace the halogen atom. In the course of studies on the metabolism of 2 -chloroacrylate, we discovered two new enzymes. 2 -Haloacrylate reductase catalyzed the asymmetric reduction of 2 -haloacrylate to produce L- 2 -haloalkanoic acid in an NADPH-dependent manner. 2 -Haloacrylate hydratase catalyzed the hydration of 2 -haloacrylate to produce pyruvate. The enzyme is unique in that it catalyzes the non-redox reaction in an FADH 2 -dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine compounds (OCs) {{were determined}} in the blubber of male finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) collected in 1990 and 2000 / 01 from the South China Sea. Among the <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> analyzed, DDTs and PCBs were the predominant contaminants in the porpoises, ranging from 26, 000 to 260, 000 and 1400 to 28, 000 ng/g lipid wt., respectively. PBDEs {{ranged from a}} minimum of 84 ng/g lipid wt., in 1990 {{to a maximum of}} 980 ng/g lipid wt., in 2001, showing a significant increase during the time period investigated. Congener profiles in finless porpoises did not shift to higher BDE congeners during these years, implying a continuous discharge of lower BDE commercial mixtures, such as PentaBDE. For OCs, HCHs concentrations decreased significantly, while others did not exhibit any significant temporal variation. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were found to be highest for CHLs and lowest for HCB. PBDEs and PCBs had comparable BMFs, indicating a similar potential for biomagnification through the food web...|$|R
40|$|As a {{model of}} high trophic level carnivores, sledge dogs were fed from 2 to 18 months of age with minke whale blubber {{containing}} <b>organohalogen</b> <b>compounds</b> (OHC) corresponding to 128 µg PCB/day. Controls were fed uncontaminated porcine fat. Thyroid hormone levels were assessed in 7 exposed and 7 control sister bitches (sampled at age 6 - 18 months) and 4 exposed and 4 control pups, fed the same diet as their mothers (sampled age 3 - 12 months). Lower free and total T 3 and T 4 were seen in exposed vs. control bitches beyond 10 months of age, and total T 3 was lower through 3 - 12 months of age in exposed pups. A negative correlation with thyroid gland weight was significant for SumDDT, as was a positive association with total T 3 for dieldrin. This study therefore supports observational data that OHCs may adversely affect thyroid functions, and it suggests that OHC exposure duration of 10 months or more may be required for current OHC contamination levels to result in detectable adverse effects on thyroid hormone dynamics...|$|R
