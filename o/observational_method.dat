25|$|Cousin {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This <b>observational</b> <b>method</b> Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The <b>observational</b> <b>method</b> {{applied to}} {{consciousness}} {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we discuss}} the {{contribution}} of <b>observational</b> <b>methods</b> to understanding the processes involved in triggering interest and establishing engagement. We begin by reviewing the literatures on interest and engagement, noting their similarities, differences, and the utility to each of better understanding the triggering process. We then provide background information about <b>observational</b> <b>methods</b> and a case illustration of their use in a post hoc analysis of observation records collected during an out-of-school biology workshop. In conclusion, we consider the advantages and limitations of <b>observational</b> <b>methods.</b> We suggest that they can offer unique insight into the triggering process. In the post hoc analysis, this includes information about multiple, co-occurring triggers for interest and variation in responses to triggers based on learner characteristics. It is acknowledged that <b>observational</b> <b>methods</b> are not sufficient, but they are necessary; they provide essential detail, especially for understanding the triggering process...|$|R

40|$|Unstructured {{observation}} involving “going {{into the}} field” {{to describe and}} analyze what is seen and heard, may be an underutilized method in nursing research. The role of the observer, {{the nature of the}} observations, data sources, systematic recording and analysis of observations, appropriate analysis of the data, and corroboration of findings are important considerations when ensuring rigour in <b>observational</b> <b>methods.</b> However, the description of <b>observational</b> techniques and <b>methods</b> provided in published accounts of qualitative research is sparse, and it is therefore difficult to evaluate the truthfulness, credibility, and trustworthiness of many research studies. <b>Observational</b> <b>methods</b> can address discrepancies between what people say and what they actually do, and they can capture the context in which nurses practice. Little is known about the oral hygiene care practices of nurses caring for hospitalized older adults with longer lengths of stay, despite the link between poor oral hygiene and systemic illness. To date, the oral hygiene care provided by nurses has not been directly observed, nor have unstructured observational techniques been used to observe any caregivers providing such interventions. In the absence of studies related to oral hygiene care, an integrative review of the literature has been undertaken to critically analyze how rigour was ensured in qualitative or mixed - methods studies in which <b>observational</b> <b>methods</b> were used to study nurses as they provided other types of basic nursing interventions.

50|$|Winckelmann contributed various essays to the Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften; and, in 1766, {{published}} his Versuch einer Allegorie.

The plates in this work are representations of objects which had either been falsely explained or not explained at all.

5000|$|The <b>observational</b> <b>method</b> was {{proposed}} by Karl Terzaghi and discussed {{in a paper}} by Ralph B. Peck (1969) {{in an effort to}} reduce the costs during construction incurred by designing earth structures based on the most-unfavorable assumptions (in other words, geological conditions, soil engineering properties and so on). Instead, the design is based on the most-probable conditions rather than the most-unfavorable. Gaps in the available information are filled by observations: geotechnical-instrumentation measurements (for example, inclinometers and piezometers) and geotechnical site investigation (for example, borehole drilling and a CPT). These observations aid in assessing the behavior of the structure during construction, which can then be modified in accordance with the findings. The method may be described as [...] "learn-as-you-go".|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} trends in the {{theoretical}} and methodological study of attitudes {{in the social sciences}} - mentalist and behaviorist. The mentalist trend treats attitude as a mediating concept while the behaviorist trend operationally defines it as a probability concept, though in research practice both derive their attitude measures from response variation. While there are many different views concerning the structure and components of attitudes, there is, however, an overwhelming agreement that attitudes are learned, lasting, and positively related to behavior. Methodology in attitude studies includes direct and indirect measures of all kinds, but language attitude studies have tended to make more use of questionnaires than of other methods. The matched guise technique - a sociolinguistic experimental technique used to determine the true feelings of an individual or community towards a specific language, dialect, or accent - has been extensively used for studies relating to the social significance of languages and language varieties. A special adaptation of this technique, called mirror image, appears promising for measuring consensual evaluations of language switching at the situational level. Situational based self-report instruments such as those used by Greenfield and Fishman also promise to be very effective instruments for studies pertaining to normative views concerning the situational use of languages and language varieties. The commitment measure {{has been found to be}} particularly suited for collecting data on behavioral tendencies. Data obtained through interviewing may be difficult to process and score - and may provide bias from those being interviewed - but the research interview can be particularly effective for attitude assessment, especially when used to complement the <b>observational</b> <b>method.</b> Data collected through the <b>observational</b> <b>method</b> can be formally processed like data obtained through more formalized instruments if attempts are made to record the data in more public forms instead of only through the approach most characteristic for this kind of data have used so far.|$|E

40|$|<b>Observational</b> <b>methods</b> involve {{watching}} and recording what individuals do and say in particular settings {{and have been}} used frequently within the social sciences, in different ways and across varying contexts. They are valued for their potential to gain insights into ‘‘natural’’ behaviours through creating an environment closer to everyday life than a face-to-face interview, allowing observation of behaviours {{similar to those that}} may naturally be exhibited by participants. A number of studies exploring online health information seeking have incorporated such methods through the use of computer applications that allow recording and thus observation of online information searching behaviours in real time. However, few of these have included researchers’ reflections on carrying out this kind of research.

40|$|Purpose - To {{introduce}} {{the contents of}} the special issue, and provide an integrative overview of the development of observational methodologies in marketing research, as well as some directions for the future. Design/methodology/approach - A historical review of the development of <b>observational</b> <b>methods,</b> beginning with philosophical foundations, is provided. Key philosophical debates are summarized, and trends in <b>observational</b> <b>methods</b> are described and analyzed, with particular reference to the impact of technology. Following this, the contributions to the special issue are summarized and brought together. Findings - Observational research in marketing is more than the well-known method of "participant-observation. " In fact, technology has the potential to revolutionize observational research, and move it beyond a solely "qualitative" method. The internet, video, scanner-tracking, and neuroimaging methods are all likely to have a big impact on the development of traditional and innovative observation methods in the future. The articles in the special issue provide a good overview of these developments. Research limitations/implications - The views of the authors may differ from those of others. Practical implications - Observation is a far more wide-ranging strategy than many perceive. There is a need for more expertise in all types of observational methodologies within marketing research schools and departments, in order to take account of the vast opportunities which are currently emerging.
