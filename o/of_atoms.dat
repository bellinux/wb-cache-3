5|$|In 1857, German chemist August Kekulé {{observed}} that carbon often has four other atoms bonded to it. Methane, for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.

5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair <b>of</b> <b>atoms,</b> one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E

Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E

5|$|After Von Laue's {{pioneering}} research, {{the field}} developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg {{and his father}} William Henry Bragg. In 1912–1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two- and three-dimensional arrangements <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> in the unit-cell.|$|E
5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement <b>of</b> <b>atoms.</b> Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect.

The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up <b>of</b> <b>atoms.</b> A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
