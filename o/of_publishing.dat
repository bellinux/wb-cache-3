5|$|After graduation, Johnson {{purchased}} half-ownership of The Anderson News {{and served}} as the paper's editor and publisher. In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson {{to enter into a}} joint venture to purchase the Richmond Daily Register. Lured by the idea <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> a daily paper, Johnson accepted. As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932. He continued to hold this position and publish the Register through 1939.|$|E

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue data {{provides}} an expedient basis for fatigue-limited engineering design by alleviating {{the necessity of}} explicit testing. However, published fatigue data often exhibits incomplete documentation of the associated test conditions. Incomplete documentation introduces uncertainties in fatigue life prediction that may limit the applicability <b>of</b> the <b>published</b> fatigue data for design applications. Characterization of the applicability <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue data is critical for robust fatigue-limited design. However, no quantitative methods have been identified which respond to this requirement. A novel method has been developed to provide a systematic characterization of the applicability <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue data based on internationally recognized standards. This method provides a conceptual mechanism to: &# 039;identify the applicability <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue test data for specific design scenarios&# 039; thereby informing engineers of potential limitations <b>of</b> <b>published</b> data and allowing prioritization of multiple data sources; &# 039;identify material domains of insufficient applicability&# 039; thereby providing a robust basis for identifying beneficial fatigue test programs; &# 039;compromise between design complexity and the uncertainties inherent in fatigue life prediction; &# 039;define a framework for the appropriate documentation <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue data. A sample <b>of</b> <b>published</b> fatigue data sources associated with a specific fatigue-limited safety&# 039; critical design scenario was assessed by the method presented in this paper. For {{the majority of the}} sampled references, the associated documentation was insufficient to allow the fatigue test data to be confidently applied to the subsequent design activity...|$|R

5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> a book that had been withdrawn in its home country.

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO <b>of</b> <b>Publishing</b> Eric Hirshberg found that even after five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page. However, Hirshberg stated that Activision realized they needed to reinvent the series so that consumers would not consider it {{much the same as}} previous games and to help sway those that were turned off by the earlier saturation of music games.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve <b>of</b> <b>publishing,</b> Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E

5|$|Although Acclaim, SNK, Ubisoft, Midway, Activision, Infogrames, and Capcom {{supported}} the system {{during its first}} year, third-party developer support proved difficult to obtain due {{to the failure of}} the Sega Saturn and the profitability <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> for the PlayStation. Namco's Soul Calibur, for example, was released for the Dreamcast because of the relative unpopularity of the Soul series at the time; Namco's more successful Tekken franchise was associated with the PlayStation console and PlayStation-based arcade boards. Nevertheless, Soul Calibur received overwhelming critical acclaim and has been frequently described {{as one of the best}} games for the system. Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the system, including the Power Stone series, in addition to a temporary exclusive in the popular Resident Evil series called Resident Evil Code: Veronica. The Dreamcast is also known for several shoot 'em ups, most notably Treasure's Bangai-O and Ikaruga.|$|E
5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, he {{was elected}} as a deputy in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, where he {{promoted}} abolition of slavery. Baldorioty de Castro founded the Partido Autonomista in 1887, but he was only able to work within {{it for a few}} months. He was tried and imprisoned in Fort San Felipe del Morro, after being accused <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> propaganda that affected the Spanish government's image. He was released after a brief period in jail, but his time in prison affected his health, which contributed to his death on September 30, 1889.|$|E
5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land. A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further exacerbated by the cost <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> Reason, and of {{the construction of a new}} home near the mouth of the Onion River. He was threatened with debtors' prison on at least one occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on {{the priority of}} the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the other man <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> results based on those of the author.|$|E

5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 is a K-type {{star in the}} Sextans constellation. It {{is about}} {{half the size of}} the Sun, and has {{approximately}} half the mass. WASP-43 has one known planet in orbit, a Hot Jupiter called WASP-43b. At the time <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun. WASP-43 has also been found to be an active star that rotates at a high velocity.|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} February 2011, Al-Wasat and al-Jamri covered {{both sides of}} the conflict. Al-Jamri was involved in reconciliation talks until 15 March when Saudi troops entered Bahrain. That day, Al-Wasat printing facility was destroyed. Its employees which already faced harassment by groups of youths had to work from home. The next month, the newspaper was charged by government to publishing fabricated news about the uprising and was suspended. Al-Jamri acknowledged his mistake, but said he was set up and downplayed the impact of the false news. He resigned from his position and the newspaper was allowed to publish the next day. He was subsequently charged and convicted <b>of</b> <b>publishing</b> false news. In August, Al-Wasat board of directors reinstated him back to his position.|$|E
