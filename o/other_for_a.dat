5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean as a child. He also began {{developing}} his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these two interests would not overlap with each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in marine biology and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only known each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes {{that she is showing}} an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain next to each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit {{is placed on the}} number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Draza is Zoran Lazarevic's {{right-hand}} man and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Michael Benyaer in Uncharted 2 and by Fred Tatasciore in Uncharted 3. Lt. Draza is first seen with Lazarevic, {{when they first}} meet Nate face to face. Lazarevic gives him the Phurba from Nate. Later, when Chloe is taken to the train by Flynn, Nate tries to save her, but runs into Draza, {{who is in charge}} of the train. The two fight until Drake knocks Draza and takes back the Phurba. Draza wakes up and tries to strangle Drake, but is shot dead from behind by Chloe. According to some articles, Draza and Lazarevic have known each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. He uses an M4 carbine (a misnamed Colt Model 723) as his main weapon.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{represented}} Great Britain at his maiden Olympics in Beijing 2008. He {{competed in}} the singles and doubles competitions. Despite being seeded sixth in the singles competition, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} by Chinese Taipei's Yen-hsun Lu. Along with his brother Jamie, he advanced to {{the second round of the}} doubles competition with a win over the Canadian pairing of Daniel Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer. The Murray brothers were eliminated in the second round by France's Arnaud Clément and Michael Llodra. In February, Murray pulled out of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina, because of a knee injury, so Argentina thrashed the under-strength British team. Jamie Murray scathingly criticised Andy and they did not speak to each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fortnight. Their rift continued in the Olympic doubles, over a perceived lack of effort from Andy.|$|E
5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon (USAD) is an American {{academic}} {{competition for}} high school students. The United States Academic Decathlon National Championship, first held in 1982, pits winners {{at the state level}} against each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> national title. The Academic Decathlon consists of 10 events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech. The Super Quiz replaces one of the seven objective events; since 2003, it has alternated between replacing science and social science. The Academic Decathlon requires participation from students of all levels of academic ability; teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Though teams consist of nine members (three from each category), only the top two individuals from each category are counted in the final team score. Each student has the possibility of scoring up to 10,000 points, for a combined team score of 60,000.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each <b>other</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E
