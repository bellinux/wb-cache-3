There are various axial piston pump designs, including swashplate (sometimes {{referred to as}} a valveplate pump) and checkball (sometimes {{referred to as a}} wobble plate pump). The most common is the swashplate pump.

50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump <b>output</b> <b>flow</b> is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase pump <b>output</b> <b>flow</b> so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic {{hybrid vehicle}} systems {{consists}} of four main components: the working fluid, reservoir, pump/motor (in parallel hybrid system) or in-wheel motors and pumps (in series hybrid system), and accumulator. In some systems, a hydraulic transformer is also installed for converting <b>output</b> <b>flow</b> at any pressure with a very low power loss. In an electric hybrid system, energy is stored in the battery and is delivered to the electric motor to power the vehicle. During braking the kinetic energy of the vehicle is used {{to charge the battery}} through the regenerative braking. In hydraulic hybrid system, the pump/motor extracts the kinetic energy during braking to pump the working fluid from the reservoir to the accumulator. Working fluid is thus pressurized, which leads to energy storage. When the vehicle accelerates, this pressurized working fluid provides energy to the pump/motor to power the vehicle. For a parallel hybrid system, fuel efficiency gains and emissions reductions result from reduced mechanical load on the internal combustion engine due to the torque provided by the hybrid system.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand's {{success in}} raising {{agricultural}} productivity {{has been accompanied}} by higher input use, leading to adverse effects on the environment. Until recently, analysis of farm performance has tended to ignore such negative externalities. The current emphasis on environmental issues has led dairy farmers to target improvements in both environmental performance and productivity. Therefore, measuring the environmental performance of farms and integrating this information into farm productivity calculations should assist in making informed policy decisions which promote sustainable development. However, this is a challenging process since conventional environmental efficiency measures are usually based on simple input and <b>output</b> <b>flows</b> but nitrogen discharge is a complex process affected by climate, pasture composition, cow physiology and geophysical variability. Furthermore, the outdoor pastoral nature of New Zealand farming means {{that it is difficult to}} control input and <b>output</b> <b>flows,</b> particularly of nitrogen.
