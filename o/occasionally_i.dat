25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick <b>occasionally.</b> <b>I</b> certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
2500|$|His {{roles in}} the films Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), and Scars of Dracula (1970) all gave the Count very little to do. Lee said in an {{interview}} in 2005, [...] "all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear when you see the films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>I</b> sneaked one in." [...] Although Lee may not have liked what Hammer was doing with the character, worldwide audiences embraced the films, which were all commercially successful.|$|E

60|$|I {{will try}} to write for the paper <b>occasionally,</b> but <b>I</b> fear my letters will be very uninteresting, for this incessant night-work dulls one's ideas amazingly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{meet her}} <b>occasionally.</b> <b>I</b> meet {{her at the}} Square Table Club, where we fight on literature. They call it the Square Table Club, because they {{disagree}} with {{the opinions of the}} most of us real literary people of the town." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not wish}} it to be {{understood}} that I am {{in the habit of}} insulting ladies, but <b>occasionally</b> <b>I</b> have made an innocent mistake, and have met with some such response. The wrong waiter conveys to me precisely the same feeling of humiliation.|$|E

60|$|<b>Occasionally,</b> <b>I</b> have {{referred}} to what I have called the primordial valves: these are not calcified; they are formed at the first exuviation, when the larval integuments are shed: in mature Cirripedes they are always seated, when not worn away, on the umbones of the valves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} know you, {{and very}} thankful for {{what you have done}} for me. I'll make it right with you when I'm able to get around. My name is Dawson--Barwell Dawson.

60|$|And we {{fell back}} on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as the week was long. <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> wished <b>I</b> could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia, that she treated the darling of my heart {{a little too much}} like a plaything; and I {{sometimes}} awoke, as it were, wondering to find that I had fallen into the general fault, and treated her like a plaything too--but not often.|$|R

60|$|And perhaps Grand Cairo {{has thus}} filled us with more wonder even than Bagdad.

60|$|Ghosts with no {{position}} to maintain--mere middle-class ghosts-- <b>occasionally,</b> <b>I</b> believe, do a little haunting on off-nights: on All-hallows Eve, and at Midsummer; and some will even run up for a mere local event--to celebrate, for instance, {{the anniversary of the}} hanging of somebody's grandfather, or to prophesy a misfortune.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did quite right," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "and I {{thank you for}} coming. I told him he might go up there <b>occasionally,</b> but <b>I</b> {{particularly}} warned him against giving any annoyance to the neighbours." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} settled yet, Wilfrid.

6000|$|... "Not quite. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>I</b> {{meet the}} people afterwards.

50|$|The eastern dialects <b>occasionally</b> show <b>i</b> in the second- and third-person {{singular}} present indicative forms, {{instead of}} e. This is {{a remnant of}} older i-mutation in these forms. Umlaut is also sometimes found in the past subjunctive in the east.|$|R

60|$|The girls behind me, {{now that}} they were nearing the end of the journey, {{manifested}} less interest in the ride, and were speculating upon Linrock, and what it would be like. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>I</b> asked the driver a question, and sometimes the girls did likewise; but, to my disappointment, the ride seemed not to be {{the same as that of}} yesterday.|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} I {{spent in the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the water, overhung with the colourless trumpets of convolvulus. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>I</b> edged on, but only {{to keep pace with}} the sunbeams, for I was deathly cold, and as soon as shadow drew over me, fits of shivering returned.
