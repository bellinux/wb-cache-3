5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{purchased}} by Bernard Matthews, who constructed turkey sheds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b> <b>The</b> turkey farm is now operated by another farmer, but {{the construction of the}} sheds has preserved large sections of <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the ordeal, several forward air-controllers {{were sent}} out to make low passes over Khâm Đức, to locate the CCT, without success. Then, in {{response}} to a call for the nearest aircraft to land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> to search for the stranded CCT, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred J. Jeanotte approached the airfield from the south and landed his C-123 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> with support from fighter-bombers, which were used to suppress enemy fire. Not seeing the men, Jeanotte applied full power and took off to avoid taking hits from North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire. As the C-123 rolled past the CCT's position, the three men came out of their position chasing the aircraft with their arms waving. Believing that the aircraft had missed them, the three men ran back to the ditch {{on the left side of}} the runway. As the C-123 was airborne, Jeanotte banked his aircraft to the left, and that enabled the aircrew to see the three men running back towards the ditch. However, Jeanotte was deterred from making another attempt at landing, because of low fuel. The next C-123 in line, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> as fire swept through the Khâm Đức facility, and the aircrew were able to extract the stranded CCT under heavy fire, and they flew out to Đà Nẵng. By 17:00, the evacuation was over. On 13 May, 60 B-52s bombed the Khâm Đức camp.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines {{landing at}} Værnes {{en route from}} Bodø Airport was written off after a hard landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> This {{was caused by a}} high sink rate caused by the pilot {{interrupting}} the landing checklist and forgetting to arm the spoilers. No-one was killed in the accident.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 2011 it was {{reported}} that an AASM missile fired from a Dassault Rafale was used to destroy a Libyan Air Force G-2/Galeb light ground attack/trainer jet, the first Libyan warplane to challenge the no-fly zone during the 2011 Libyan civil war, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> just after the plane had landed at Misrata Airport.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> at RAF Scampton at the {{beginning}} of its take-off run. The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel missile training round. All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt. The aircraft was engulfed in flames and totally destroyed. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 HP turbine disc as the engine reached full power.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 2008, Brian Crosby {{announced}} {{his decision to}} leave Bell X1 following their 19 October Flock tour finale at the Panorama Festival in the Lebanon.

Their first show without Crosby was the opening night of an acoustic tour at the Pavilion in Cork two days after Panorama. By this time they were already performing material which was to feature on their fourth studio album, Blue Lights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Runway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saidor {{was soon}} in {{use by the}} Fifth Air Force. Its base at Nadzab was {{surrounded}} by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, {{but there was no}} such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a weather front that closed Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> and two aircraft cracked up on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.|$|E

5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to go around because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E
5|$|Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 159 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight from New York City to Los Angeles, California, with a stopover in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Kentucky, that crashed after an aborted takeoff from Cincinnati on 6 November 1967. The Boeing 707 attempted to abort takeoff when the copilot became {{concerned that the}} aircraft had collided with a disabled DC-9 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> The aircraft overran the runway, struck an embankment and caught fire. One passenger {{died as a result}} of the accident.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
5|$|In Wilson's absence at ABDA Command Headquarters in Java, Scherger {{was acting}} AOC NWA on 19February 1942 when Darwin {{suffered}} its first aerial attacks by the Japanese. Driving into town to meet Air Marshal Richard Williams, {{who was in}} transit {{on his way to}} England, Scherger first became aware of the assault after he heard anti-aircraft fire and counted twenty-seven enemy aircraft in the distance. He arrived at the civil airfield to witness a Curtiss P-40 crash land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> before his car was strafed by fighters. In a lull after the initial attack that day, he made contact with Williams before the two men were forced to take shelter in a makeshift trench that was straddled by falling bombs as a second raid got under way. Afterwards, Scherger began to restore order and launched a Hudson light bomber on a reconnaissance mission, though there was no further contact with Japanese forces.|$|E
