5|$|The {{dusky shark}} (Carcharhinus obscurus) is {{a species of}} requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, {{occurring}} in tropical and warm-temperate continental seas worldwide. A generalist apex predator, the dusky shark can be found from the coast to the <b>outer</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> and adjacent pelagic waters, and has been recorded from a depth of 400 m (1,300ft). Populations migrate seasonally towards the poles {{in the summer and}} towards the equator in the winter, traveling hundreds to thousands of kilometers. One of the largest members of its genus, the dusky shark reaches 4.2m (14ft) in length and 347kg (765lb) in weight. It has a slender, streamlined body and can be identified by its short round snout, long sickle-shaped pectoral fins, ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins, and faintly marked fins.|$|E
5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the <b>outer</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelf,</b> growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E

50|$|Ctenacis fehlmanni, {{also known}} as the {{harlequin}} catshark, has some unique characteristics that set it aside from the others. Its large mouth, small teeth and large pharynx with gill raker papillae make it unique among the Proscyllidae family. They are found in the tropical <b>outer</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> of the western Indian Ocean, off the coast of Somalia. They are oviparous, laying paired eggs in which their embryos feed solely on yolk.|$|R

25|$|Energy {{production}} boomed {{during the}} Obama presidency. An increase in oil production was driven largely by a fracking boom spurred by private investment on private land, and played {{only a small}} role in this development. The Obama administration promoted the growth of renewable energy, and solar power generation tripled during Obama's tenure. Obama also issued numerous energy efficiency standards, contributing to a flattening of growth of the total U.S. energy demand. In May 2010, Obama extended a moratorium on offshore drilling permits after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which is {{generally considered to be}} the worst oil spill in U.S. history.

40|$|The deep-sea lantern shark Etmopterus spinax {{occurs in}} the {{northeast}} Atlantic {{on or near the}} bottoms of the <b>outer</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> and slopes, and is regularly captured as bycatch in deep-water commercial ﬁsheries. Given the lack of knowledge on the impacts of ﬁsheries on this species, a demographic analysis using age-based Leslie matrices was carried out. Given the uncertainties in the mortality estimates and in the available life history parameters, several different scenarios, some incorporating stochasticity in the life history parameters (using Monte Carlo simulation), were analyzed. If only natural mortality were considered, even af ter introducing uncertainties in all parameters, the estimated population growth rate (λ) suggested an increasing population. However, ifﬁshing mortality from trawlﬁ sheries is considered, the estimates of λ either indicated increasing or declining populations. In these latter cases, the uncertainties in the species reproductive cycle seemed to be particularly relevant, as a 2 -year reproductive cycle indicated a stable population, while a longer (3 -year cycle) indicated a declining population. The estimated matrix elasticities were in general higher for the survivorship parameters of the younger age classes and tended to decrease for the older ages. This highlights the susceptibility of this deep-sea squaloid to increasingﬁ shing mortality, emphasizing that even though this is a small-sized species, it shows population dynamics patterns more typical of the larger-sized and in general more vulnerable species...|$|R

40|$|The Amundsen Sea {{sector of}} the largely marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet is {{currently}} subject to the most rapid changes in the global cryosphere. Ice streams here are marine-based on slopes that significantly deepen inland, thus are susceptible to increased future ice mass loss, directly resulting in a rising sea-level of up to 3. 4 m (Fretwell et al. 2013). However, state-of-the-art ice sheet models that aim to elucidate these future scenarios are only initialised with observational data covering the past 30 - 40 years (e. g. Favier et al. 2014), thus excluding long-term empirical data of ice sheet change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum and the subsequent deglacial period. To test the reliability of predicted future scenarios {{it is essential to}} validate models against past ice sheet configurations confirmed by empirical data from palaeo-ice sheet beds on modern Antarctic <b>continental</b> <b>shelves.</b> Attempts at reproducing the LGM ice sheet (Golledge et al. 2013), have revealed considerable mismatches between model simulations and empirical data, mainly due a lack of comprehensive palaeo-glaciological data particularly from <b>outer</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> and regions in between the large palaeo-ice stream troughs, regions known as inter-ice stream ridges. This thesis presents the mapping and detailed analysis of new marine geophysical and geological data from three formerly unstudied regions on the Amundsen Sea shelf that significantly improve our understanding of Antarctic palaeo-ice sheet dynamics and will ultimately help to better understand West Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics during and since the Last Glacial Maximum. The new information will significantly add to a hitherto sparse database of previous work, helping to test, validate, and improve ice sheet models in the vital region of the Amundsen Sea. Only by enhancing their ability to simulate past ice sheet configurations more accurately will more reliable predictions of the future evolution of these dramatically changing parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet be possible...|$|R
