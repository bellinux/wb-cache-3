5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that at one}} time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E

25|$|Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman {{authors were}} not so strict about the {{boundary}} between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible koina, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, nous (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of koina, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not {{just in terms of}} memories of sense perceptions, but in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.|$|E
25|$|Typically, predators {{attempt to}} reduce {{communication}} to prey as this will generally reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as “antmimicking spiders” because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E
25|$|Poirot sends his valet out {{investigating}} {{and finds}} an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions {{of where it}} would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. They are part of a scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ultra Jump Egg, Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story {{was more important than}} the characters within it. He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star.

The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and we got that out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> could animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E
