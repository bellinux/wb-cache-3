40|$|Summary: In this report, {{the results}} from {{a study on the}} effect of Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) {{coverage}} on Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) risk reduction is reported. Global traffic data for <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> has been evaluated in relation to the present and future global coverage of ENC to provide an overview. Also, eleven specific ship routes, representative for global merchant shipping, has been analysed to assess the ECDIS risk reducing potential in light of actual ENC coverage along these routes. Currently, the global coverage of suitable ENC lie between 82 % and 94 %. The coverage along selected routes varied from 28 % to 100 %, with four of the eleven routes having 100 % coverage. Cost effectiveness assessments were carried out, and it was found that there were big differences between oil tankers and <b>other</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships.</b> Hence, it was deemed appropriate to formulate different recommendations for oil tankers and <b>other</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships.</b> Based on the analyses carried out in this study, and the current cost efficiency criteria used at IMO, the following recommendations on mandatory carriage of ECDIS may be proposed, assuming ship lifetime 25 years: Oil tankers <b>Other</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> new ships> 500 GT. new ships> 3, 000 GT. existing ships> 3, 000 GT if not older than 20 years. existing ships> 10, 000 GT if not older than 20 years...|$|R

The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack.
