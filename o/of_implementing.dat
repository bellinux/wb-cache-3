As {{presiding}} officer of the state senate, Chandler worked with Speaker of the House John Y. Brown, Sr. to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped Chandler {{of some of his}} statutory power as lieutenant governor, after which they were able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine numbers <b>of</b> agricultural <b>implements</b> and equipments, and the effects of the distribution of farm parcels and number of owencrs on number <b>of</b> <b>implements</b> in different regions of Saudi Arabia. This analytic study was conducted based on published data from Saudi Agricultural Bank and results of the agricultural census of the Kingdom. Data were analyzed to determine the general trends in averages <b>of</b> <b>implement</b> numbers during the period between 1979 to 1990. Furthermor, effect of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>implements</b> in different regions was determined. Results showed thai Saudi Agricultural Bank distributed implements to twelve primary regions, and the increasing numbers <b>of</b> farm <b>implements</b> in some regions were proportional to the increasing numbers of farm owencrs and not with the area of farm parcels nor with the cultivated area of the region. Highly significant differences were found among the regions in the numbers <b>of</b> the distributed <b>implements.</b> These implements were primary tillage tools, secondary tillage tools, planters, sprayers, and mowers. It was found that the distribution of tillage cools and planters were related to a specific field crop. Also, distribution <b>of</b> tillage <b>implements,</b> planters, and mowers were related to forage crops.

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management.

Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> high levels of solar power.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat population has been reduced to just a few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E

Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units. Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%). There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which {{can be traced back to}} the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations.

5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E

5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
