5|$|In 1943 the Home Army began recreating the {{organization}} of the prewar Polish Army, its various units now being designated as platoons, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, and <b>operational</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 15,000-strong ARBiH 5th Corps, {{commanded}} by Divisional General Atif Dudaković, was assigned the primary objectives, {{the capture of}} Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Petrovac, Ključ and Sanski Most. Dudaković divided his eight brigades into two <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> (OGs). OG (South), which comprised the 501st Mountain, 502nd Mountain, 510th Liberation and 517th Light Brigades, augmented by elements of the 5th Military Police Battalion, was {{commanded by}} Dudaković himself. OG (North), consisting of the 503rd Mountain, 505th Mountain, 506th Liberation and 511th Mountain Brigades, was commanded his chief of staff, Brigadier Mirsad Selmanović. At the commencement of the operation, HV artillery provided fire support to OG South.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Slavonia, the JNA {{responded to}} the ZNG siege of its {{garrison}} in Vukovar, and on 14 September 1991 it deployed troops to relieve the barracks. Independent of that effort, {{the main thrust of}} the campaign against Croatia was initially planned to start on 21 September. The southern operational group of the thrust, spearheaded by the 1st Guards Mechanised Division, was expected to lift the ZNG siege of the JNA barracks in Vinkovci, and reach Našice and Slavonski Brod in two to three days. Over the next four to five days, the group was expected to reach the line OkučaniSuhopolje by advancing via the ĐakovoPožega road and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, avoiding major population centres. The northern operational group, subordinated to the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, was to advance from Osijek to Našice and then further west towards Bjelovar. The two <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> were assigned approximately 57,000 troops and 5,000 supporting personnel. The 17th (Tuzla) Corps was probably tasked with crossing the Sava Rivermarking the border of Croatiaat Slavonski Brod and Slavonski Šamac to join the westward drive along the motorway, but the crossing never occurred.|$|E

25|$|The main {{offensive}} {{began on}} 9 August, but the army remained in its positions until 11 August. During this time, it conducted reconnaissance and harassing attacks across the Amur, capturing {{several of the}} river's islands. The main bodies of the <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> were placed in concentration areas, located 12–17 miles in the army's rear. Due to the rapid advance of the other Soviet forces, Purkayev ordered the army late on 10 August to begin its attack early on the following morning. Aihun, Sunwu, and Hsunho were to be captured {{by the end of}} 11 August. That night, the <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> moved forward to their attack starting positions. The attack began early in the morning under the cover of an artillery bombardment, as reconnaissance and assault detachments from the first echelons of the <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> crossed the Amur, capturing bridgeheads near Sakhalian, Aihun, and Holomoching, coming into contact with Japanese outposts and covering forces. The 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions commenced crossing the river shortly afterwards, less one regiment, east and west of Konstantinovka; the 396th Division and 368th Regiment near Blagoveshchensk, and the 101st Fortified Region crossed south of Blagoveshchensk.|$|E
25|$|The <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> slowly {{advanced}} south, capturing Nencheng and Peian on 20 and 21 August. The Kwantung Army formally surrendered on 18 August, and the army's <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> slowly moved towards Qiqihar and Harbin. It reached Qiqihar on 21 August, {{where it}} linked up with {{troops from the}} 36th Army. The Japanese around the fortified regions were subsequently described by historian David Glantz as the most formidable faced by Soviet troops during the invasion of Manchuria. The level of resistance and road conditions slowed the army's advance {{to an average of}} 20 kilometers a day, one of the lowest speeds of Soviet forces during the invasion. During the invasion, it advanced a depth of 200 kilometers into Manchuria.|$|E
25|$|The 369th Rifle Division's second echelon 614th Rifle Regiment and the 101st Fortified Region were {{tasked with}} {{reducing}} the Aihun and Sunwu Fortified Regions, as the <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> marched in two routes towards Nencheng and Peian, more than 93 miles (150 kilometers) apart. The advance was slowed by bad weather and muddy and rutted roads, and two engineer sapper battalions {{were attached to}} the lead detachments of the <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> {{to speed up the}} advance. For the next several days, the bypassed Japanese troops continued to defend the Sakhalian, Aihun and Sunwu Fortified Regions, launching frequent attacks against the Soviet troops. After additional heavy artillery and bombing from the Soviet 18th Mixed Aviation Corps of the 10th Air Army, Japanese resistance slackened on 17 and 18 August as many defenders surrendered or were destroyed. Around Sunwu, a total of 17,061 Japanese military personnel were captured, while 4,520 soldiers at Aihun did not surrender until 20 August.|$|E

25|$|With German {{communities}} {{living within}} the pre-war borders of Poland, {{there was an}} expressed fear of disloyalty of Germans in Eastern Upper Silesia and Pomerelia, based on wartime Nazi activities. Created on order of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi ethnic German organisation called Selbstschutz carried out executions during Intelligenzaktion alongside <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> of German military and police, in addition to such activities as identifying Poles for execution and illegally detaining them.|$|E
25|$|The Leningrad Front (initially the Leningrad Military District) was {{commanded}} by Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. It included the 23rd Army {{in the northern}} sector between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and the 48th Army in the western sector between the Gulf of Finland and the Slutsk–Mga position. The Leningrad Fortified Region, the Leningrad garrison, the Baltic Fleet forces, and Koporye, Southern and Slutsk–Kolpino <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> were also present.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildup of}} the Soviet {{partisan}} force in western Belarus was ordered and implemented during 1943, with nine brigades, 10 detachments and 15 <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> transferred {{from east to}} west, effectively tripling the partisan force there (reaching 36,000 troops in December 1943). It is estimated that 10–12,000 personnel were transferred, and about same number came from local volunteers. The buildup of the military force was complemented by the intensification of the underground Communist Party structures and propaganda activity.|$|E
5000|$|Independent <b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> Silesia (Polish: Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Śląsk, SGO Śląsk) was an <b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> of the Polish Army, {{created in}} September 1938 to annex Zaolzie from Czechoslovakia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> Bielsko (Grupa Operacyjna Bielsko, GO Bielsko), {{named after}} {{southern}} Polish city of Bielsko-Biała, was an <b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> of the Polish Army which {{fought in the}} 1939 Invasion of Poland. Officially created on 23 March 1939, it belonged to Kraków Army, concentrated in southwestern corner of the Second Polish Republic. In the night of 2/3 September 1939, it was renamed into <b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> Boruta, after General Mieczysław Boruta-Spiechowicz.|$|R
50|$|With further reorganizations of the Air Force, the <b>operational</b> <b>group</b> {{of which}} the {{squadron}} was part of was re-designated as <b>Operational</b> <b>Group</b> 51 (Grupo Operacional 51), and in 1978 the squadron's own designation was changed to 201 Squadron.|$|R
25|$|The {{core group}} is logically a ring, but is {{superimposed}} on an inner hub-and-spoke structure of ideological authority. Each {{member of the}} core forms another hub and spoke system (see infrastructure cells), the spokes leading to infrastructure cells {{under the supervision of}} the core group member, and possibly to <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> which the headquarters support. Note that in this organization, there is a point at which the operational cell becomes autonomous of the core. Members surviving the operation may rejoin at various points.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 1941, {{thousands}} of people were taken from their homes, loaded onto freight trains and taken to Siberia. Whole families, women, children and old people were sent to death camps in Siberia. The crime was perpetrated by the Soviet occupation regime on the orders of high authorities in Moscow. Prior the deportation, the Peoples Commissariat established <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> who performed arrests, search and seizure of the property. Arrests took place in all parts in Latvia including rural areas.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of war against Poland, German forces carried out massacres and executions of civilians. Many of these atrocities were not properly researched after the war due to the political divide between Eastern and Western Europe during the Cold War, wrote Böhler. Polish eyewitness accounts do not identify the German units involved; that information is traceable only through German records. Therefore, the crimes committed by the Heer (the regular German army) were often wrongly attributed to SS <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> in Polish historiography. It is estimated that there were two hundred executions every day in September 1939. Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reich Main Security Office, complained that the rate was too slow. Typically, the mass executions were conducted in public spaces such as the town square in order to inflict terror.|$|E

500|$|Efforts of the Posavina OG in the Novska–Lipik {{area were}} {{supported}} by HV units and special police subordinated to the Pakrac Operational Group (OG). On 5 December at 10am, the Pakrac OG attacked TO and JNA positions in Lipik, about [...] southwest of Pakrac, and the villages of Dobrovac and Kukunjevac {{to the west of}} Lipik, situated along the Novska–Lipik road. The Croatian special police entered Lipik that afternoon, but the town was not brought under full control until 11am the following day when the HV also captured Kukunjevac. On 7 December the Pakrac OG captured Dobrovac, while the Posavina OG units advanced from Bair towards Dobrovac, capturing the village of Korita. The two <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> linked up in the Novska–Lipik area as the HV captured Jagma on 8 December and the villages of Subocka and Gornje Kričke on 9 December. On 10–13 December, the HV launched an unsuccessful attack aimed at capturing a portion of Pakrac which remained under control of the JNA.|$|E
500|$|The HV {{deployed}} up to 9,000 {{troops on}} rotation {{through the area}} during the Operation Winter'94, keeping approximately 3,000–4,000 {{troops on the ground}} at any time, and the HVO fielded an additional 2,000–3,000. The defending force of the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps consisted of about 3,500 soldiers, spread along the [...] front line. The Bosnian Serb defenders were commanded by Colonel Radivoje Tomanić. The attacking force was nominally controlled by the HVO, with Major General Tihomir Blaškić in overall command of the attack. The HV General Staff appointed Major General Ante Gotovina as commander of the Split Corps and commanding officer of the HV units. The Croatian forces were organized into <b>operational</b> <b>groups</b> (OG). OG Sinj was located on the left flank (on Croatian soil), OG Livno in the centre and OG Kupres on the right flank of the attack in Bosnia and Herzegovina. OG Kupres mainly consisted of HVO units, while the bulk of the OG Sinj and OG Livno was made up of HV troops.|$|E
