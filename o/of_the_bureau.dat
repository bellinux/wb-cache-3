Prior to the college's separation from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957, the deans of the College of Forestry and its predecessors were not appointed by the board but were the directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Forestry acting as ex officio heads of the college. Due to the distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños (about 64 kilometers), directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureau</b> appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.|$|E

Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either {{failed to respond to}} his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureau</b> were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureau.</b>|$|E

By 1942 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau's</b> activities were classified {{work for the}} war effort. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau's</b> activities were <b>the</b> non-rotating proximity fuze, guided missile developments (see <b>the</b> Bat), establishment <b>of</b> a Radio Propagation Laboratory, critical materials research on optical glass which Germany had previously supplied, on quartz and synthetic rubber and measurement and calibration services.

5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the president's wishes, matters of policy were {{restricted}} to the president, Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C.

5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau of Ships was project officer.|$|E

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Patriotic War, Kirilenko was {{directly}} involved with evacuating industry to safe zones.
