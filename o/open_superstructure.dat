The ZT4s, being brand new, were partly fitted with the 8cm schwerer Granatwerfer 34/1 in an <b>open</b> <b>superstructure</b> {{to produce a}} {{self-propelled}} 81 mm mortar; some received the AVIS-1 turret.|$|E
50|$|This version, {{like the}} Sd.Kfz. 233, carried the short 7.5 cm K 51 L/24 gun, in a raised <b>open</b> <b>superstructure.</b> The gun's low {{velocity}} made its armour-piercing round ineffective against most Allied tanks, but allowed the high-explosive shell casing to be thinner and thus contain more explosive. The HEAT round for this weapon was, however, effective against vehicles. In December 1944, production ended {{in favour of}} the 234/4.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{temperature}} on nitrification in biological {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) filters was evaluated {{in order to improve}} the understanding of the nitrification process in drinking water treatment. The study was conducted in a northern climate where very cold water temperatures (below 2 °C) prevail for extended periods and rapid shifts of temperature are frequent in the spring and fall. Ammonia removals were monitored and the fixed nitrifying biomass was measured using a method of potential nitrifying activity. The impact of temperature was evaluated on two different filter media: an <b>opened</b> <b>superstructure</b> wood-based activated carbon and a closed superstructure activated carbon-based on bituminous coal. The study was conducted at two levels: pilot scale (first-stage filters) and full-scale (second-stage filters) and the results indicate a strong temperature impact on nitrification activity. Ammonia removal capacities ranged from 40 to 90 % in pilot filters, at temperatures above 10 °C, while more than 90 % ammonia was removed in the full-scale filters for the same temperature range. At moderate temperatures (4 – 10 °C), the first stage pilot filters removed 10 – 40 % of incoming ammonia for both media (<b>opened</b> and closed <b>superstructure).</b> In the full-scale filters, a difference between the two media in nitrification performances was observed at moderate temperatures: the ammonia removal rate in the <b>opened</b> <b>superstructure</b> support (more than 90 %) was higher than in the closed superstructure support (45 %). At low temperatures (below 4 °C) both media performed poorly. Ammonia removal capacities were below 30 % in both pilot- and full-scale filters. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Hangars with <b>open</b> <b>superstructures</b> often attract {{birds to}} nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to {{increase}} ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips {{to the side of}} the door) by the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|R
5000|$|From about 1550 onwards, however, {{there is}} {{historical}} {{evidence of the}} actual use of such roof structures in fortifications. In the sphere of influence of the Franconian free imperial city of Nuremberg some [...] have survived to the present or been reconstructed. For instance, some cavaliers and bastions at the imperial city fortress of Lichtenau at [...] are topped by such constructions. Numerous corbels on the curtain walls indicate the intention to build removable roofs, but contemporary illustrations show that these plans did not come fully to fruition. A bird's eye view {{at the time of}} the Thirty Years' War (around 1630, Swedish State Archives) portrays a defensive system with removable roofs on four of the five bastions. The three cavaliers also have correspondingly <b>open</b> <b>superstructures.</b> No roofs can be seen above the curtain walls. This illustration view largely corresponds to the present state of this Renaissance fortress.|$|R
40|$|Ferrocene {{has been}} {{encapsulated}} within a symmetric ether-amide dendritic shell and its redox potential monitored {{in a variety}} of solvents. The dendritic effect generated by the branched shell is different in different solvents. In less polar, non hydrogen bond donor solvents, attachment of the branched shell to ferrocene increases its E 1 / 2, indicating that oxidation to ferrocenium (charge buildup) becomes thermodynamically hindered by the dendrimer, a result explained by the dendrimer providing a less polar medium than that of the surrounding electrolyte solution. The effect of electrolyte concentration on redox potential was also investigated, and it was shown that the concentration of “innocent” electrolyte has a significant effect on the redox potential by increasing the overall polarity of the surrounding medium. Dendritic destabilization of charge buildup is in agreement with the majority of reported dendritic effects. A notable exception to this is provided by the asymmetric ferrocene dendrimers previously reported by Kaifer and co-workers, in which the branching facilitated oxidation, and it is proposed that in this case the dendritic effect is generated by a different mechanism. Interestingly, in methanol, the new symmetric ferrocene dendrimer exhibited almost no dendritic effect, a result explained by the ability of methanol to interact extensively with the branched shell, generating a more <b>open</b> <b>superstructure.</b> By comparison of all the new data with other reports, this study provides a key insight into the structure−activity relationships which control redox processes in dendrimers and also an insight into the electrochemical process itself. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of ammonia during drinking water production {{can be the}} source of several water quality problems during distribution and during disinfection when chlorine is used. It is therefore important to optimize the ammonia removal before disinfection. The purpose of this work was to compare nitrification on an <b>opened</b> <b>superstructure</b> (Picabiol) and two closed superstructure (Picacarb and Calgon F 400) granular activated carbon (GAC) during colonization of new filters and after longer operating times in pilot and full-scale filters. Fixed nitrifying biomass levels, ammonia removal and oxygen consumption were monitored at high and low temperatures and at two different ammonia loadings. In first stage pilot filters supplied by an ammonia concentration higher than 0. 4 [*]mg l- 1 N-NH 4 and at temperatures higher than 20 oC, nitrification capacity was higher on Picabiol than on Picacarb. At low temperature, no ammonia removal occurred on both materials. Calgon and Picabiol provided equal nitrification performances. In full-scale second stage filters fed with ammonia concentrations ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 16 [*]mg l- 1 N-NH 4, nitrification performances were similar on Picabiol and on Calgon. In cold water, none of these filtration materials provided a proper nitrification; nitrifying biomass, however, did not disappear on the GAC filters during winter. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|On 10 and 17 December 1930 Brandt had {{obtained}} {{an order for}} six complete sets: tractor, trailer and tractor-carrying trailer. To honour its commitments to Vickers, it let the trailers and one tractor be built in Britain. To conform {{to the idea of}} production in France, Brandt delegated the task to build a new tractor type to the Latil company, as it had too little experience itself. The Latil prototype, presented on 7 August 1931 was very much on lines of the British type and strongly resembled the later Universal Carrier: fully tracked and with most of the vehicle covered by an <b>open</b> rectangular <b>superstructure</b> to ensure as large a carrying capacity as possible. Only a small driver's and engine section on the front was armoured on top. On 17 July the commission considered the type ready for troop trials.|$|R
5000|$|Secondary {{armament}} {{would have}} been sixteen 6"/53 caliber guns. Twelve of these were to be on Mark 13 mountings in unarmored casemates; the rest {{would have been}} placed <b>open</b> on the <b>superstructure</b> deck. This was {{a departure from the}} 5"/51 caliber guns used in U.S. battleships since the [...] of 1908. The 6"/53 fired a 105 lb projectile at a velocity of 3000 ft/s to a maximum range of 21000 yd at a maximum elevation of 20 degrees. They were installed in s when the South Dakotas were canceled under the Washington Naval Treaty and several large submarines built during the 1920s. Later light cruisers would use the similar but more potent 6"/47 caliber gun.|$|R
40|$|Background: Today, the {{environment}} of a company is characterized by quick changes like leaps of technology and market shifts. The problem is how this turbulent environment and an uncertain future affect how a company creates strategies and how its structure is adapted. Can a certain choice of strategies or a certain structure {{be a way of}} dealing with an changing environment? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore if and how Banverket Telenät, {{as an example of a}} company in a turbulent business like the Swedish telecom industry, tries to deal with an uncertain future through strategy and structure. Procedure: We have carried through a qualitative case study with interviews and gathering of additional information concerning the business. Result: Banverket Telenät applies an emergent strategy formation connected with scenario thinking, also applying a resource based perspective. This is appropriate for dealing with an uncertain environment. In addition to that the company has a differentiation strategy within a chosen segment. The company has a flat sociostructure with informal paths of information together with an <b>open</b> flexible <b>superstructure,</b> which also is advantageously facing an uncertain future...|$|R
50|$|Just {{before noon}} on 6 May 1942, a torpedo passed astern of the Puritan - its wake sighted {{by one of}} the T.C. McCobb survivors. General alarm was sounded. A {{submarine}} surfaced a few moments later, 2 nmi km off, and fired a warning shell that passed overhead and landed in the water ahead of the ship. Krantz ordered the ship to full speed, hoping to outrun the attacker, and steered a zig-zag course. The sub fired a few more shells that missed, but then refined its targeting and barraged the Puritan with about 70 hits over the course of about 25 minutes. The shelling laid <b>open</b> the ship's <b>superstructure,</b> perforated the funnel, broke all the windows and instrument faces, set fire to parts of the interior, and finally disabled the steering mechanism at the stern.|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} wurtzite/zincblende (WZ and ZB, respectively) <b>super{{structure}}s</b> <b>opens</b> new avenues for band structure engineering {{and holds the}} promise of digitally controlling the energy spectrum of quantum confined systems. Here, we study growth kinetics of pure and thus defect-free WZ/ZB homostructures in GaP nanowires with the aim to obtain monolayer control of the ZB and WZ segment lengths. We find that the Ga concentration and the supersaturation in the catalyst particle are the key parameters determining growth kinetics. These parameters can be tuned by the gallium partial pressure and the temperature. The formation of WZ and ZB can be understood with a model based on nucleation either at the triple phase line for the WZ phase or {{in the center of}} the solid-liquid interface for the ZB phase. Furthermore, the observed delay/offset time needed to induce WZ and ZB growth after growth of the other phase can be explained within this framework...|$|R
40|$|Dendrimer-like silica {{particles}} with a center-radial dendritic {{framework and}} a synergistic hierarchical porosity have {{attracted much attention}} due to their unique <b>open</b> three-dimensional <b>superstructures</b> with high accessibility to the internal surface areas; however, the delicate regulation of the hierarchical porosity {{has been difficult to}} achieve up to now. Herein, a series of dendrimer-like amino-functionalized silica particles with tunable hierarchical pores (HPSNs-NH 2) were successfully fabricated by carefully regulating and optimizing the various experimental parameters in the ethyl ether emulsion systems via a one-pot sol-gel reaction. Interestingly, the simple adjustment of the stirring rate or reaction temperature was found to be an easy and effective route to achieve the controllable regulation towards center-radial large pore sizes from ca. 37 - 267 (148 +/- 45) nm to ca. 8 - 119 (36 +/- 21) nm for HPSNs-NH 2 with particle sizes of 300 - 700 nm and from ca. 9 - 157 (52 +/- 28) nm to ca. 8 - 105 (30 +/- 16) nm for HPSNs-NH 2 with particle sizes of 100 - 320 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful regulation towards center-radial large pore sizes in such large ranges. The formation of HPSNs-NH 2 may be attributed to the complex cross-coupling of two processes: the dynamic diffusion of ethyl ether molecules and the self-assembly of partially hydrolyzed TEOS species and CTAB molecules at the dynamic ethyl ether-water interface of uniform small quasi-emulsion droplets. Thus, these results regarding the elaborate regulation of center-radial large pores and particle sizes not only help us better understand the complicated self-assembly at the dynamic oil-water interface, but also provide a unique and ideal platform as carriers or supports for adsorption, separation, catalysis, biomedicine, and sensor. </p...|$|R
