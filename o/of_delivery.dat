40|$|Title: Control {{over and}} {{inspections}} {{of the incoming}} flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> Background: Staples experiences difficulties to get their incoming flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> to deliver on time. This is because Staples has a poor control of its suppliers in the current situation. Another problem that Staples experience is that their inspection of the incoming flow is taking too long time. These problems can lead to unnecessary tied up capital, backlogs and rest orders. Staples would like to explore the possibility of improving the control and inspection of the incoming flow. Purpose: To identify the amount of late and early incoming flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> and describe how Staples could control {{them in order to}} receive more on-time deliveries. Moreover to describe how Staples could improve the inspection process {{in order to make the}} incoming flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> flow faster into storage. Methodology: The study is a case study in Staples central warehouse in Växjö, Sweden. Results: Suggestion has been made for how Staples could improve the control over the incoming flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries,</b> and the inspections of the incoming flow <b>of</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The suggestions made are based on how Staples could control deliveries in advance in order to receive more on-time deliveries. Moreover specific requirements could be made towards the suppliers to improve the inspections in order to reduce the flow time into storage...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if there are monthly variations in the rate <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Burdwan Medical College West Bengal, India. Materials and Methods: A retrospective descriptive study {{carried out in the}} Burdwan Medical College. We extracted the total number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> from the hospital records for over four year period and analyzed the figures for the monthly variation in delivery rates. This was repeated for a standardized 30 -day month and the findings noted. The extracted data then fed into a computer and analysis was performed, based on the grouping <b>of</b> the <b>delivery</b> rates per month. Results: The monthly distribution <b>of</b> total <b>deliveries</b> showed a slightly sinusoidal pattern with two peaks. A major peak spanning two months, August and September and another small peak in April and May. The figure also depicted the nadir number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> to occur majorly in February and March and another in December. Conclusion: There is a seasonal variation in delivery rates in our study...|$|R
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E

40|$|During daily 3 -hr sessions, 5 rhesus monkeys drank drug {{solutions}} and water that were concurrently available. The drug solutions were: 1 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) pentobarbital (2 monkeys), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 0. 5 % ethanol (1 monkey), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 1 % ethanol (1 monkey), and 8 % ethanol (1 monkey). The drug solution and water were available under identical two-component tandem fixed-ratio continuous-reinforcement N schedules. Two variables were manipulated: {{the size of}} the fixed-ratio component and the number <b>of</b> liquid <b>deliveries</b> (N) in the second component. <b>Deliveries</b> <b>of</b> the drug solution maintained higher rates of responding than did <b>deliveries</b> <b>of</b> the drug vehicle, water. The number <b>of</b> drug <b>deliveries</b> per session increased with increases in the number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> per fixed ratio and decreased with increases in fixed-ratio size. Analysis of the results in terms of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> to responses showed that the number <b>of</b> drug <b>deliveries</b> per session was directly related to the size of this quotient. Finally, when fixed-ratio size was repeatedly doubled, the following orderly relationship emerged: The greater the number <b>of</b> available drug <b>deliveries</b> per fixed ratio, the less was the percent {{decrease in the number of}} fixed ratios completed per session. It was concluded that increases in the number <b>of</b> liquid <b>deliveries</b> per fixed ratio resulted in increases in reinforcing efficacy...|$|R

5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa.

A newer extended-release levodopa preparation {{does seem to be}} more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E

On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

However, his attorney Jeffrey A. Lustick successfully blocked the fugitive warrant extradition process, therefore legally allowing Leaf to go to Texas on his own. Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges in Texas. In April 2010, he pleaded guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of a simulated controlled substance, all felonies.

5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E
