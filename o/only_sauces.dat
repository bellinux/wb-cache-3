5000|$|Working {{during the}} day for the Citrus Company, Sharp experimented with various {{vegetable}} combinations to make hot sauce and gave them away to friends. At their urging, she began to manufacture the sauce and in 1981, began Marie Sharp’s Fine Foods. Her first product was called [...] "Melindas" [...] after the farm owned by her husbands family. For ten years, she worked to build the brand, expanding into jams, jellies, and marmalades made with tropical fruit. In 1988, {{with the help of}} the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the United States Agency for International Development, she attended Clemson University, studying food packaging. Sharp found a distributor in the United States and began to market the product internationally. It was the first Belizean-made export product to gain wide acceptance and the <b>only</b> habanero-based <b>sauce</b> on the market at that time. In a marketing move, the distributor filed a trademark on the name. When Sharp found out in 1991 that the distributor had trademarked her product, she hired a lawyer. Because of the cost involved, travel constraints and the fact that as her sole distributor she could not work, Sharp eventually gave up the name to her sauce in exchange for a release of her contractual obligations, after a five-year struggle.|$|R

50|$|Phoenix Racing began {{racing in}} the Cup Series in 1990, when it fielded the No. 51 Plasti-Kote Chevrolet Lumina for Jeff Purvis. In four races, Purvis failed {{to finish a}} race, his best {{finishing}} being a 31st at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Phoenix attempted to run a full schedule in 1991, but soon cut back to a part-time schedule, completing six races in total. Due {{to a lack of}} funding, the team only ran two races in 1992, with Finch's company Phoenix Construction of Panama City, Florida, serving as sponsor. In 1993, the team ran all of the restrictor plate races on the schedule, except for the Daytona 500, for which they failed to qualify. For 1994, they picked up sponsorship from Country Time and had planned to run a limited schedule with Neil Bonnett driving. Bonnett was killed in a practice crash at Daytona before the 1994 Daytona 500, and Purvis was brought back to drive the car. In six races, his best finish was 21st. Phoenix changed its number to 44 in 1995, and ran six more races with Purvis and Jackaroo <b>Sauce,</b> <b>only</b> finishing one race.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{high pressure}} and heat resistances of spores of five proteolytic Clostridium botulinum strains {{and of the}} nonpathogenic surrogate strain Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 were compared with their heat-only resistances {{on the basis of}} equivalent accumulated thermal lethality, expressed as equivalent minutes at a reference temperature of 105 °C (F 105 °C). Comparisons were made with three model (i. e., diluted) products, namely, 30 % (wt/wt) Bolognese sauce, 50 % (wt/wt) cream sauce, and rice water agar. Pressure was determined to act synergistically with heat during high-pressure thermal (HPT) processing for C. botulinum FRRB 2802 (NCTC 7273) and C. botulinum FRRB 2804 (NCTC 3805 and 62 A) in the Bolognese and cream sauces and for C. botulinum FRRB 2807 (213 B) in the Bolognese <b>sauce</b> <b>only.</b> No synergy was observed for C. botulinum FRRB 2803 (NCTC 2916) or FRRB 2806 (62 A) or C. sporogenes FRRB 2790 (NCTC 8594 and PA 3679) in any of the model products. No significant protective effect of pressure against spore inactivation was determined for any Clostridium strain in any product. Because synergy was not consistently observed among strains of C. botulinum or among products, the prediction of inactivation of C. botulinum spores by HPT sterilization (HPTS) for the present must assume a complete lack of synergy. Therefore, any HPTS process for low-acid shelf-stable foods must be at least thermally equivalent to an F 0 process of 2. 8 min, in line with current good manufacturing practices. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the use of C. sporogenes PA 3679 as a surrogate organism may risk overestimating inactivation of C. botulinum by HPT processing...|$|R
