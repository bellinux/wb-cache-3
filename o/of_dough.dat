Malawach is a thin circle <b>of</b> <b>dough</b> toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{reducing}} agent (L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate), oxidising agents (ina­cti­va­ted dry yeast, L-tyrosine) and other two amino acids (L-threonine and L-tryptophan) on the rheological characteristics <b>of</b> wheat flour <b>dough</b> and its quality were studied. The addition of oxidising agents increases the values such as tenacity and decreases extensibility which were measured on the alveograph. From the consistograph values, weakening <b>of</b> the <b>dough</b> also decreases. While reducing agents increase the extensibility and weakening <b>of</b> the <b>dough,</b> they decrease its deformation energy. The addition of L-tryptophan caused a higher increase in tenacity <b>of</b> the <b>dough</b> {{but on the other}} hand a larger decrease in extensibility and deformation energy. L-tryptophan caused better stability <b>of</b> the <b>dough.</b> L-treonine was found to be an oxidising agent. The dough with L-threonine weakened rapidly and therefore fast preparation <b>of</b> the <b>dough</b> is necessary. It means that the time <b>of</b> mixing and <b>dough</b> proo­fing must be reduced...|$|R

25|$|In the 1st century AD {{writings}} of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff.

An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers <b>of</b> <b>dough</b> with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets <b>of</b> <b>dough</b> does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.

40|$|The {{addition}} of aspartame to white bread dough affected the gas production due to baker's yeast. After 3 hours of incubation, the total gas production of 3 % aspartame-added dough decreased about 0. 4 times that <b>of</b> standard <b>dough.</b> Gas production decreased with increasing concentrations of aspartame. On the other hand, the expansion <b>of</b> aspartame-added <b>dough</b> increased with increasing concentration <b>of</b> aspartame.

40|$|The Z-blade mixing {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> zero-developed (ZD) <b>doughs</b> {{from the}} flours of two wheat cultivars of different gluten strength {{was compared to}} that <b>of</b> conventionally mixed <b>dough</b> made from the same flours. In farinograph experiments, use <b>of</b> ZD <b>dough</b> led to shorter development time (with less energy requirement), less stability time, and consequently earlier breakdown compared to conventional mixing of the corresponding flour¿water mixture. Mixing <b>of</b> ZD <b>doughs</b> led to an almost similar decrease of glutenin macro-polymer (GMP) wet weight as that <b>of</b> <b>doughs</b> prepared from flour¿water mixtures. However, comparison of wet weight of re-assembled GMP revealed that until time-to-peak (TTP) mixing, {{there was no difference}} in GMP recovery with respect to the starting material used in the z-blade mixing experiments. Beyond TTP, recovery <b>of</b> GMP in <b>doughs</b> prepared from both starting materials was reduced. The results of large-strain deformation rheology showed strong visco-elastic behaviour as characterised by the highest values of fracture properties (except ¿H), followed by a decline in those properties upon further mixing for doughs mixed from both flour¿water mixture and ZD dough from both types of wheat cultivars. It was concluded that at mixing regimes before TTP, there was no difference between ZD doughs and flour¿water mixtures in the mixer. When ZD dough is used as a starting material for <b>dough</b> preparation instead <b>of</b> flour, extra care should be taken not to over-mix the developing dough...|$|R
