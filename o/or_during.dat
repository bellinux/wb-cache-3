5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before <b>or</b> <b>during</b> implant placement.|$|E

5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, <b>or</b> <b>during,</b> the boundary interval.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation <b>or</b> <b>during</b> long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, <b>or</b> <b>during</b> their flight; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E

5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later.

When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night <b>or</b> <b>during</b> bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death <b>or</b> <b>during</b> decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street {{stations}} were converted {{for use as}} an air-raid shelter, with entrances to the shelter at King William Street and at six sites south of the Thames (of nine planned). In the 1960s the disused tunnels were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station and all the entrances bar that at 9 London Bridge Street were infilled with concrete. It is now only possible to access the tunnels from Three Castles House or a passage from the Jubilee line at London Bridge. Most of the C's six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to {{the line in the}} 1920s <b>or</b> <b>during</b> more recent modernisations.

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before <b>or</b> <b>during</b> marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running <b>or</b> <b>during</b> migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E

It trained at Fort Ord, Camp Roberts, Fort Hunter Liggett and Fort Irwin. On 1 October 1985 the division was redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division (Light), organized again as a light infantry division. It was the first US division specially designed as such. The various battalions of the 31st, and 32nd regiments moved from the division, replaced by battalions from other regiments, including battalions from the 21st Infantry Regiment, the 27th Infantry Regiment, and the 9th Infantry Regiment. The 27th and 9th infantry regiments participated in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities <b>or</b> <b>during</b> conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
