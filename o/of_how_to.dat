Because many of the teachers said they were unsure <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers {{about what to do}} if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E

5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> shoplift, and portrays {{a situation in which}} people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E

5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E

His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> plan and execute a vacation in the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E

However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed the problem <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEver {{since their}} {{introduction}} by Hoare in 1969, invariant assertions have, justifiably, {{played a key}} role in the analysis of while loops. In this paper, we discuss a distinct but related concept, viz invariant relations, and show how these can be used to answer many questions pertaining to the analysis <b>of</b> loops, including: <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute the function <b>of</b> the loop; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute an invariant assertion <b>of</b> the loop; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute a weakest precondition <b>of</b> the loop; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute a strongest postcondition <b>of</b> the loop; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute the termination condition <b>of</b> a loop; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> verify whether the loop computes a given function; <b>how</b> <b>to</b> verify whether the loop is correct with respect to a given specification; and finally <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute an invariant function for the loop. Using a tool we have developed at the University of Tunis to derive invariant relations, we show how all these tasks can be automated by means of a computer algebra system, viz Mathematica (©Wolfram Research). Whenever applicable, we compare the performance of our tool against the performance of others...|$|R

5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
