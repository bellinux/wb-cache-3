It {{is suggested that}} the new <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> relaunch Kerrang! as a monthly title. Bauer will retain ownership of Kerrang!

25|$|Individual V. moorii territories are defended {{for their}} food {{resources}} and territory <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> defend more aggressively against individuals of species with similar diets, including conspecifics. V. moorii feeding territories in deeper areas {{are larger than}} those in shallow areas. Population density decreases with greater depth, so a large territory in a deep area can be more easily defended from competitors than a similarly sized territory in a shallow area. There is also lower algal productivity at greater depths because less light is available for photosynthesis, which also contributes to larger territories with increasing depth.|$|E
25|$|On February 14, 2014, Toyota {{announced}} a global recall of third generation Prius. The recall {{is related to}} a software fault having been identified in the hybrid-control system which might cause the hybrid drive inverter transistors to overheat. This will cause the car {{to go into a}} limited performance mode (i.e. limp home mode) or may even stall the car entirely. <b>Owners</b> <b>will</b> be notified with a letter to rectify the problem for free of charge or reimbursement for anyone who was charged to rectify the problem prior to recall.|$|E

50|$|Often, before re-breeding, the {{stallion}} <b>owner</b> <b>will</b> {{require a}} veterinary report, giving {{the cause for}} the problem. This {{is to ensure that}} the mare is healthy & able to carry a foal, and to check for genetic incompatibilities. (There are certain genetic crosses that are lethal to the foal.) There is no point to re-breeding in such cases, so the stallion <b>owner</b> <b>will</b> allow substitution of another mare, or will return the stud fee.|$|R
25|$|In May 2015 the Government {{decided to}} keep the {{existing}} incentives through 2017, and the political parties in Parliament agreed to reduced and phase {{out some of the}} incentives. Beginning in January 2018, electric car <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> be required to pay half of the yearly road license fee and the full rate as of 2020. The value-added tax (VAT) exemption for electric cars will end in 2018, but replaced by a new scheme, which may be subjected to a ceiling that could be reduced as technology develops. The agreement also gave local authorities the right to decide whether electric cars can park for free and use public transport lanes.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, a Bowery Historic District was {{registered}} with the New York State Register of Historic Places and, because of that, automatically nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. A grassroots community organization named Bowery Alliance of Neighbors (BAN) {{in association with the}} community-based housing organization called the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council led the effort for creation of the historic district. The designation means that property <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> have financial incentives to restore rather than demolish old buildings on the Bowery. BAN was recognized for its preservation efforts with a Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation in 2013.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{research}} has engaged three further directions – the speculation {{that at least}} some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E

25|$|Small {{denomination}} {{currency and}} particularly coins are sometimes {{difficult to come}} by in Argentina, especially in Buenos Aires. The problem has developed to a stage in which some shop <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> not sell items if the transaction involves giving the purchaser change in coins. It has also been exacerbated by ATMs, which tend to give out only 100 peso notes, and by bus companies, some of which will take only coins in payment and sell these at a 5–10% markup {{on the black market}} rather than depositing them at banks. This situation has improved in the years following the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002). Nowadays nearly all bus lines in Buenos Aires have a SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico; Unified Electronic Ticket System) smartcard reader, allowing passengers to pay electronically without coins.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. <b>Owners</b> <b>will</b> simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
25|$|California {{is a very}} geologically diverse {{region and}} varies greatly {{in the range of}} climates and terroirs that can be found. Most of the state's wine regions are found between the Pacific coast and the Central Valley. The Pacific Ocean and large bays, like San Francisco Bay, serve as {{tempering}} influences to the wine regions nearby providing cool winds and fog that balance the heat and sunshine. While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat of frost damage though springtime. To curb the threat of frost, vineyard <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and smudge pots to protect the vines.|$|E

500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business <b>owners</b> <b>will</b> establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E
