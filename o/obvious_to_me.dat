5|$|It is very <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that you}} must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly {{the best of their}} rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{ever since they}} came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I {{do not think the}} Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E

40|$|I am {{actually}} going to continue Professor Ead 2 ̆ 7 s discussion on procreation {{and think about it}} in a slightly different way. As an inheritance law scholar, the definition of the parent-child relationship has <b>obvious</b> importance <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because it determines who is an heir. As a feminist scholar, the definition is also significant <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because the legal rules regarding the parent-child relationship provide a unique perspective on the dialectical link between property and family...|$|R
60|$|Only one <b>obvious</b> point occurs <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> add. If the Kaiser {{has more}} than any other man the sense of the poetry of the ancient things, the sword, the crown, the ship, the nation, he has the sense of the poetry of modern things also. He has one sense, and it is even a joke against him. He feels the poetry of one thing that is more poetic than sword or crown or ship or nation, the poetry of the {{telegram}}. No one ever sent a telegram who did not feel like a god. He is a god, for he is a minor poet; a minor poet, but a poet still.|$|R
5000|$|Topham recalls, [...] "I {{was only}} 15 then, {{three or four}} years younger than the rest, {{and there was no way}} my parents would let me go out five or six nights a week to play music, even though I was already {{bringing}} home double what my father was earning. I was going on to Epsom Art School and they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take it seriously. Eric Clapton was the <b>obvious</b> person <b>to</b> replace <b>me.</b> Later on I didn't regret leaving because they'd moved away from the blues music that I was interested in. Even if I'd stayed with them to become professional I think I would have left later for the same reasons Eric left." ...|$|R
500|$|Madonna {{visited her}} {{hometown}} of Detroit during May 2014 and contributed funds to three of the city's organizations, to help eliminate poverty there. The singer released {{a statement saying that}} she was inspired by their work, adding that [...] "it was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had to get involved and {{be part of the solution}} to help Detroit recover". Continuing to extend her business ventures, the singer premiered MDNA Skin in 2014, a range of skin care products in Tokyo, Japan; the products were later launched in the United States in late 2017. In October 2016, Billboard named Madonna its Woman of the Year. Her [...] "blunt and brutally honest" [...] speech at the ceremony received widespread coverage in the media. Her upcoming projects include co-writing and directing a film adaptation of Andrew Sean Greer's novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Tentatively titled Loved, the film would portray the protagonist's relationship with her gay twin brother Felix.|$|E
2500|$|... the Osirak reactor {{that was}} bombed by Israel in June 1981 was {{explicitly}} {{designed by the}} French engineer Yves Girard to be unsuitable for making bombs. That was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on my 1982 visit.|$|E
2500|$|Mozilla {{developer}} Asa Dotzler noted: [...] "It {{seems pretty}} <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the Chrome team is bowing {{to pressure from}} Google's advertising business and that's a real shame. I had hoped they'd demonstrate a bit more independence than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the first, I am no optimist, but I have the firmest belief that the Divine Government (if we may use such a phrase to express {{the sum of the}} [...] "customs of matter") is wholly just The more I know intimately of the lives of other men (to say nothing of my own), the more <b>obvious</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the wicked does not {{flourish}} nor is the righteous punished. But for this to be clear we must bear in mind what almost all forget, that the rewards of life are contingent upon obedience to the whole Law--physical as well as moral--and that moral obedience will not atone for physical sin, or vice versa.|$|R
6000|$|Whoso clearly appreciates {{all that}} is implied in the falling of a stone can have no {{difficulty}} about any doctrine simply on account of its marvellousness. But the longer I live, the more <b>obvious</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the most sacred act of a man's life is to say and to feel, [...] "I believe such and such to be true." [...] All the greatest rewards and all the heaviest penalties of existence cling about that act The universe is {{one and the same}} throughout; and if the condition of my success in unravelling some little difficulty of anatomy or physiology is that I shall rigorously refuse to put faith in that which does not rest on sufficient evidence, I cannot believe that the great mysteries of existence will be laid open <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on other terms.|$|R
6000|$|The charge I {{brought against}} it was, I remember, {{a lack of}} unity. It professed to be {{a study of the}} English {{situation}} in the early nineties, but it was all deflected, I said, and all the interest was confused by the story of Victor Radnor's fight with society to vindicate the woman he had loved and never married. Now in the retrospect and with a mind full of bitter enlightenment, I can do Meredith justice, and admit the conflict was not only essential but cardinal in his picture, that the terrible inflexibility of the rich aunts and the still more terrible claim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the [...] "infernal punctilio," [...] and Dudley Sowerby's limitations, were the central substance of that inalertness the book set itself to assail. So many things have been brought together in my mind that were once remotely separated. A people that will not valiantly face and understand and admit love and passion can understand nothing whatever. But in those days what is now just <b>obvious</b> truth <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was altogether outside my range of comprehension....|$|R
2500|$|DiFranco {{issued an}} apology on January 2, 2014 {{following}} continued criticism.

2500|$|In 1994 the Montgomery Advertiser {{published}} an eight-part critical {{report on the}} SPLC, saying that it exaggerated {{the threat posed by}} the Klan and similar groups in order to raise money, discriminated against black employees, and used misleading fundraising tactics. The SPLC dismissed the series as a [...] "hatchet job". SPLC's co-founder Joe Levin stated: [...] "The Advertiser's lack of interest in the center's programs and its obsessive interest in the center's financial affairs and Mr. Dees' personal life makes it <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the Advertiser simply wants to smear the center and Mr. Dees." ...|$|E
2500|$|Development on the Hurd {{began in}} 1990 after an {{abandoned}} kernel attempt in 1986, {{based on the}} research TRIX operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). According to Thomas Bushnell, the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, [...] "It is now perfectly <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this would have succeeded splendidly and {{the world would be}} a very different place today". In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the Mach microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its early}} release in the United States, many American critics {{dismissed}} Fires on the Plain as a gratuitously bleak anti-war film. In 1963, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a quite harsh description, writing [...] "Never have I seen a more grisly and physically repulsive film than Fires on the Plain." [...] He continued, [...] "So purposefully putrid is it, {{so full of}} degradation and death... that I doubt if anyone can sit through it without becoming a little bit ill... That's how horrible it is." [...] He notes however, [...] "this {{is a tribute to}} its maker, for it is perfectly <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Kon Ichikawa, the director, intended it to be a brutally realistic contemplation of one aspect of war." [...] He points out, [...] "...with all the horror in it, there are snatches of poetry, too..." [...] He ends the review commenting that the only audience who would enjoy the film were those with bitter memories towards the Japanese held over from World War II.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it badly needed pepping up. I told them to bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By {{the time it was}} brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's bedrest {{was over}} by late 1927, {{and she began}} socializing with her old school friends, who were now at {{university}} and involved in student politics. She joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists — including the exiled Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, and the Italian-American photographer Tina Modotti. At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most successful artists and a notable figure in PCM. They had met briefly in 1922, when he was painting a mural at her school. Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her {{to pursue a career}} as an artist. Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed, [...] "an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity ... They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ... It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this girl was an authentic artist".|$|E
60|$|The {{advantages}} {{to be gained}} by these two amendments are too <b>obvious</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> comment upon them. One session in each year is provided for by the Constitution, in which there are no restrictions as to the subjects of legislation by Congress. If more are required, it is always in the power of Congress, during their term of office, to provide for sessions at any time. The first of these amendments would protect the public against the many abuses and waste of public moneys which creep into appropriation bills and other important measures passing during the expiring hours of Congress, to which otherwise due consideration can not be given.|$|R
500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was <b>obvious,</b> at least <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|R
5000|$|Sketch {{has said}} {{of the time of}} the {{formation}} of the band, when she and the band members were in their early to mid-twenties. [...] "I was in a musical lull, I couldn’t stand what I was listening to," [...] naming Sleater-Kinney as one example. “The local scene was also pretty shitty, and of course the radio was brutal. Then, by total fluke, my mom’s friend’s husband, Ron <b>Obvious,</b> hired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help with the audio wiring for a studio he was building for Bryan Adams.” <b>Obvious</b> introduced Katie <b>to</b> the world of independent music, and what she calls [...] "that ’80s sound." [...] He created mix-tapes of bands he thought she’d appreciate as a violinist (Roxy Music, Ultravox) and singers with an [...] "amazing natural vocal pitch" [...] (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nina Hagen, Kate Bush)). This job also led Sketch to Tara Nelson, the engineer who would later record the Organ’s first EP.|$|R
