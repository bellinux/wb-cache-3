5000|$|A 1992 {{meta-analysis}} {{suggested that}} <b>overlearning</b> does significantly affect recall over time. It also {{concluded that the}} size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of <b>overlearning,</b> task type, and length of retention. The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested <b>overlearning</b> effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of <b>overlearning.</b> The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks. The amount of <b>overlearning</b> affected retention: more <b>overlearning</b> led to more retention on both types of task. [...] The length of the retention interval also affected <b>overlearning,</b> but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants <b>overlearning</b> physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.|$|E
50|$|Some {{recent studies}} {{explicitly}} examined {{the interaction of}} <b>overlearning</b> with retention interval, {{and concluded that the}} effects of <b>overlearning</b> tend to be fairly short-lived. <b>Overlearning</b> may be more useful in instances when learners only need short-term retention of the material.|$|E

This research suggests that <b>overlearning</b> may be an inefficient study method for long-term retention of geography facts and word definitions. <b>Overlearning</b> improves short-term retention of material, but learners must also spend more time studying. Over time the improvements created by <b>overlearning</b> fade, and the learner is no better off than someone who did not spend time <b>overlearning</b> the material.|$|E

However, we here show that <b>overlearned</b> sequences (e. g. letters, numbers, weekdays, months) involve an unexpected right hemispheric activation {{in both the}} middle temporal gyrus and temporoparietal junction. Our findings offer a framework for understanding neuropsychological patterns seen in conditions such as synesthesia, in which anomalous perceptual experiences are triggered by <b>overlearned</b> sequences, and also in semantic dementia, in which left hemisphere damage disrupts word knowledge even while sequences can be spared...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that patients with}} frontal lesions have problems inhibiting automatic response tendencies. Whereas inhibition deficits of <b>overlearned</b> responses have been extensively investigated using interference tasks like the Stroop task (J. R. Stroop, 1935), it is controversial whether patients with frontal brain lesions also have problems inhibiting imitative responses. Using an interference paradigm, {{the present study investigated}} imitative response tendencies in patients with frontal lesions. In addition, it tested whether patients deficient in the inhibition of imitative responses correspondingly have problems inhibiting <b>overlearned</b> responses. It was found that the group with frontal lesions displayed significantly stronger imitative response tendencies than the group with nonfrontal lesions. Furthermore, it was shown that the inhibition of imitative responses is functionally unrelated to Stroop interference...|$|R
40|$|Neuropsychological {{research}} has {{established that the}} inhibition of dominant response tendencies {{is a function of}} the prefrontal cortex. These inhibitory mechanisms are tested using tasks like the Stroop task, in which the prepotency of the dominant response is based on a learned relationship of stimulus and response. However, it has also been reported that patients with prefrontal lesions may have problems inhibiting imitative responses. The question arises of whether the inhibition of <b>overlearned</b> and imitative responses entails the same or different functional mechanisms and cortical networks. In a recent neuropsychological study with prefrontal patients we found first evidence for such a dissociation. The present fMRI study further investigated this question by directly comparing brain activity in the inhibition of <b>overlearned</b> and imitative response tendencies. It emerges that response inhibition in the two tasks involves different neural networks. While the inhibition of <b>overlearned</b> responses requires a fronto-parietal network involved in interference control and task management, the inhibition of imitative responses involves cortical areas that are required to distinguish between self-generated and externally triggered motor representations. The only frontal brain area that showed an overlap was located in the right inferior frontal gyrus and is probably related to the generation of the stop signal...|$|R

40|$|Our {{primary goal}} was to develop and {{validate}} a task that could provide evidence about how humans learn praxis gestures, such as those involving the use of tools. To that end, we created a video-based task in which subjects view a model performing novel, meaningless one-handed actions with kinematics similar to praxis gestures. Subjects then imitated the movements with their right hand. Trials were repeated 6 times to examine practice effects. EEG was recorded during the task. As a control, subjects watched videos of a model performing a well-established (over learned) tool-use gesture. These gestures were also imitated 6 times. Demonstrating convergent validity, EEG measures of task-related cortical activation were similar in topography and frequency between the novel gesture task and the <b>overlearned,</b> praxis gesture task. As in studies assessing motor skill learning with simpler tasks, cortical activation during novel gesture learning decreased as the same gestures were repeated. In the control condition, repetition of <b>overlearned</b> tool-use gestures were also associated with reductions in activation, though to a lesser degree. Given that even <b>overlearned,</b> praxis gestures show constriction of EEG activity with repetition, {{it is possible that}} that attentional effects drive some of the repetition effects seen in EEG measures of activation during novel gesture repetition...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{eye-tracking}} {{research has}} revealed that spoken language can guide eye gaze very rapidly (and closely time-locked to the unfolding speech) toward referents in the visual world. We discuss whether, and to what extent, such language-mediated eye movements are automatic rather than subject to conscious and controlled decision-making. We consider whether language-mediated eye movements adhere to four main criteria of automatic behavior, namely, whether they are fast and efficient, unintentional, unconscious, and <b>overlearned</b> (i. e., arrived at through extensive practice). Current evidence indicates that language-driven oculomotor behavior is fast but not necessarily always efficient. It seems largely unintentional though {{there is also some}} evidence that participants can actively use the information in working memory to avoid distraction in search. Language-mediated eye movements appear to be for the most part unconscious and have all the hallmarks of an <b>overlearned</b> behavior. These data are suggestive of automatic mechanisms linking language to potentially referred-to visual objects, but more comprehensive and rigorous testing of this hypothesis is needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{striking}} {{thing about}} the richly varied area referred to as nonverbal communication is that, as compared to language, it has been virtually neglected by systematic research until very recently. However, even where research studies have surfaced in this area, there remains a profound neglect {{of the importance of}} cultural factors. Deviations from cultural norms in <b>overlearned</b> areas like interpersonal distancing, timing and looking can create unanticipated, unrecognized and inexcapable sources of cross cultural communication difficul-ties and ill feelings. It is {{not simply a matter of}} a member of one culture &dquo;looking too much&dquo; or &dquo;too little&dquo; at someone of another culture, but more likely a matter of a conflict between two highly complex, totally <b>overlearned</b> and usually out-Gf-awareness patterns of behavior. Accordingly this paper reports part of a larger project in which broad patterns of nonverbal behaviors in black conversants were dtudied. Kendon (1967) was perhaps one of the first investigators to establish empirically that the apparently simple procedure of taking turns in conversation is managed by a fine and subtle coordination of nonverbal behaviors.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{learning}} a new skill leads to structural changes in the brain. However, it is unclear whether it is the acquisition or continuous practicing of the skill that causes this effect and whether brain connectivity of patients with schizophrenia can benefit from such practice. We examined the effect of 6 months exercise on a stationary bicycle on the brain in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Biking is an endemic skill in the Netherlands and thus offers an ideal situation to disentangle the effects of learning vs practice. The 33 participating patients with schizophrenia and 48 healthy individuals were assigned to either one of two conditions, ie, physical exercise or life-as-usual, balanced for diagnosis. Diffusion tensor imaging brain scans were made prior to and after intervention. We demonstrate that irrespective of diagnosis regular physical exercise of an <b>overlearned</b> skill, such as bicycling, significantly increases the integrity, especially of motor functioning related, white matter fiber tracts whereas life-as-usual leads to a decrease in fiber integrity. Our findings imply that exercise of an <b>overlearned</b> physical skill improves brain connectivity in patients and healthy individuals. This has important implications for understanding the effect of fitness programs on the brain in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, the outcome may even apply to the nonphysical realm...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} neural activations underlying {{a verbal}} fluency task and cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of Broca's speech region (Brodmann's areas 44 and 45). To do so, we reanalyzed {{data from a}} previous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) [Brain 125 (2002) 1024] and from a cytoarchitectonic study [J. Comp. Neurol. 412 (1999) 319] and developed a method to combine both data sets. In the fMRI experiment, verbal fluency was investigated in 11 healthy volunteers, who covertly produced words from predefined categories. A factorial design was used with factors verbal class (semantic vs. <b>overlearned</b> fluency) and switching between categories (no vs. yes). fMRI data analysis employed SPM 99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping). Cytoarchitectonic maps of areas 44 and 45 were derived from histologic sections of 10 postmortem brains. Both the in vivo fMRI and postmortem MR data were warped to a common reference brain using a new elastic warping tool. Cytoarchitectonic probability maps with stereotaxic information about intersubject variability were calculated for both areas and superimposed on the functional data, which showed the involvement of left hemisphere areas with verbal fluency relative to the baseline. Semantic relative to <b>overlearned</b> fluency showed greater involvement of left area 45 than of 44. Thus, although both areas participate in verbal fluency, they do so differentially. Left area 45 is more involved in semantic aspects of language processing, while area 44 is probably involved in high-level aspects of programming speech production per se. The combination of functional data analysis with a new elastic warping tool and cytoarchitectonic maps opens new perspectives for analyzing the cortical networks involved in language...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tics are the {{defining}} feature in Tourette syndrome {{and can be}} triggered by watching tics or single voluntary movements. This automatic imitation of movements referred to as "echopraxia" has been ascribed to a failure in top-down inhibition of imitative response tendencies. Alternatively, it could be interpreted {{in the context of}} automatic <b>overlearned</b> behavior. To this end, we investigated 18 Tourette patients aged 28. 22 years (9. 44 standard deviation; 16 male) and 24 healthy controls (mean age 29. 21 years [9. 1 standard deviation]; 17 male) using an adapted version of an action-interference paradigm. METHODS: Patients {{were asked to respond to}} 2 different auditory tones with either a facial movement that was part of their tic repertoire (tic-like movement), or a facial movement that was not (nontic movement). Simultaneously, behaviorally irrelevant videos of the 2 same facial movements were presented, which were either compatible or incompatible with the movement executed by the patient. Movements in healthy controls were matched to those in the patients. RESULTS: Healthy participants responded faster in compatible than in incompatible trials. Tourette patients showed the same effect for nontic movements. However, their responses were equally fast in incompatible and compatible trials when the movement they were asked to execute was a tic-like movement. Error rates did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that tic-like movements do not occur as a consequence of a failure to inhibit motor output. Instead, tics might be considered highly <b>overlearned</b> behavior that can be triggered without interference by external, incompatible movement stimuli. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. </p...|$|R
