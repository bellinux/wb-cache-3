5|$|Climatic and <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> places {{physiological}} {{constraints on}} organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{changes in}} the liquid in the cnida make it a much more {{concentrated}} solution, so that <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class Hydrozoa, sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 atmospheres, {{similar to that of}} scuba air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2milliseconds (0.002second).|$|E

40|$|Summary. The forces {{governing}} {{the movement of}} water across the pulmo-nary capillaries were studied in 39 intact, spontaneously breathing dogs. A situation favoring the net movement of {{water out of the}} pulmonary capillaries was created by means of partial pulmonary venous obstruction (left atrial balloon catheter) followed by rapid saline hemodilution. A predetermined difference between pulmonary capillary and plasma colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> was maintained for periods of 1 to 2 hours. Left atrial (PLA) and plasma colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> (7 rp 1) were measured directly. The water content of the lungs was measured serially by an indicator-dilution technique, and at autopsy by drying the lungs. The rate of accumulation of lung water was measured in four groups of animals: in three of the groups, the capillary hydrostatic and colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> were varied; in the fourth group, the right lymphatic duct was obstructed in addition. The average rate of water accumulation in the lungs varied in a nonlinear way with the level of the capillary hydrostatic-plasma colloid osmotic pres...|$|R
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure,</b> and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E

50|$|Abegg {{discovered}} {{the theory of}} freezing-point depression and anticipated Gilbert Newton Lewis's octet rule by revealing that the lowest and highest oxidation states of elements often differ by eight.

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E

These results suggested that {{extreme conditions}} could accelerate more energy to synthesize a series of proteins or enzymes for the better cell growth and metabolism, while the EMP pathway and TCA cycle continued to rise, which was also supported by the report of Varela et al.

40|$|A {{freezing}} slide apparatus {{is described}} for visual observation of freezing water and melting ice within plant cells. The slide {{consists of an}} ordinary microscope slide glued into a Plexiglass jacket, through which cold 90 % ethyl alcohol is pumped at varying rates for temperature control. Temperature is recorded {{by means of an}} iron-constantan thermocouple wire (25 -micron diameter) connected to a recording potentiometer. Tissue strips were quick frozen (at a cooling rate of 33 C per ½ minute) and then warmed very slowly (at a rate of 2 C per minute) for observation of melting points. This apparatus has been used to determine <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> of cell sap of guard and adjoining epidermal cells of Chrysanthemum morifolium and Pelargonium hortorum. An accuracy of ± 1. 2 atmospheres is possible. Wide variations among <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> of both guard and epidermal cells were found at any one stomatal aperture in both species...|$|R

5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure)</b> in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure,</b> and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E
40|$|Many {{single-stranded}} (ss) RNA viruses self assemble from {{capsid protein}} subunits and the nucleic acid {{to form an}} infectious virion. It is believed that the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged RNA and the positively charged viral capsid proteins drive the encapsidation, although there is growing evidence that the sequence of the viral RNA also {{plays a role in}} packaging. In particular the sequence will determine the possible secondary structures that the ssRNA will take in solution. In this work, we use a mean field theory to investigate how the secondary structure of the RNA combined with electrostatic interactions affects the efficiency of assembly and stability of the assembled virions. We show that the secondary structure of RNA may result in negative <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> while a linear polymer causes positive <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> for the same conditions. This may suggest that the branched structure makes the RNA more effectively packaged and the virion more stable...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the mechanism, magnitude, and time course of facial puffiness {{that occurs in}} microgravity, seven male subjects were tilted 6 degrees head down for 8 hr, and all four Starling transcapillary pressures were directly measured before, during, and after tilt. Head-down tilt (HDT) caused facial edema and a significant elevation of microvascular pressures measured in the lower lip. Subcutaneous and intramuscular interstitial fluid pressures in the neck also increased {{as a result of}} HDT, while interstitial fluid colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> remained unchanged. Plasma colloid <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> dropped significantly after 4 hr of HDT, suggesting a transition from fluid filtration to absorption in capillary beds between the heart and feet during HDT. After 4 hr of seated recovery from HDT, microvascular pressures remained significantly elevated by 5 to 8 mm Hg above baseline values despite a significant HDT diuresis and the orthostatic challenge of an upright, seated posture. During the control (baseline) period, urine output was 46. 7 ml/hr; during HDT, it was 126. 5 ml/hr...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{undertaken}} on {{the water}} relation of I. graveolens seeds and their germination behaviour under different moisture stresses revealed that, as the temperature increases the water uptake also increases.

The germination too is effected, being higher at lower <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> and high percentage moisture contents...|$|R
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
25|$|Xylem sap {{consumption}} may {{be related}} to osmoregulation. High <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> in the stomach, caused by high sucrose concentration, can lead to water transfer from the hemolymph to the stomach, thus resulting in hyperosmotic stress and eventually to the death of the insect. Aphids avoid this fate by osmoregulating through several processes. Sucrose concentration is directly reduced by assimilating sucrose toward metabolism and by synthesizing oligosaccharides from several sucrose molecules, thus reducing the solute concentration and consequently the <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Oligasaccharides are then excreted through honeydew, explaining its high sugar concentrations, which can then be used by other animals such as ants. Furthermore, water is transferred from the hindgut, where <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> has already been reduced, to the stomach to dilute stomach content. Eventually, aphids consume xylem sap to dilute the stomach <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure.</b> All these processes function synergetically, and enable aphids to feed on high-sucrose-concentration plant sap, as well as to adapt to varying sucrose concentrations.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} protists, species of Amoeba control <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{with the help}} of a membrane-bound {{organelle}} called the contractile vacuole. Amoeba proteus has one contractile vacuole which slowly fills with water from the cytoplasm (diastole), then, while fusing with the cell membrane, quickly contracts (systole), releasing water to the outside by exocytosis. This process regulates the amount of water present in the cytoplasm of the amoeba.|$|R

25|$|While {{osteoarthritis}} is a degenerative {{joint disease}} that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes {{occur in the}} earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and hydrostatic and <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> which tends to draw water in.|$|E
25|$|The {{balance of}} these forces varies with change in {{temperature}} or solvent properties. The total <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{acting on the}} system is the sum <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the gel. It is further shown that the phase transition can be induced by the application of an electrical field across the gel. The volume change at the transition point is either discrete (as in a first-order Ehrenfest transition) or continuous (second order Ehrenfest analogy), depending {{on the degree of}} ionization of the gel and on the solvent composition.|$|E
