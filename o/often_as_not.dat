25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not,</b> and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E
500|$|Following Callaghan's visit, some {{barricades}} were breached, but {{the majority}} remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform. [...] Still the army {{made no move to}} enter the area. [...] Law and order was maintained by a 'peace corps'—volunteers organised by the DCDA to patrol the streets and man the barricades. [...] There was very little crime. [...] Punishment, in the words of Eamonn McCann, [...] "as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> consisted of a stern lecture from Seán Keenan on the need for solidarity within the area."

500|$|Hal Hinson of The Washington Post {{gave the}} {{character}} a negative review. Labeling Timon and Pumbaa the only interesting characters in The Lion King, Hinson questioned Simba's {{role as the}} film's hero. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times agreed, [...] "A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> it's the sidekicks who get the real work done." [...] Turan went on to pan Simba, describing him as [...] "irritatingly callow." [...] Chris Hick of the Deseret News complained {{about the fact that}} Simba and the other [...] "characters in The Lion King are not as warm and fuzzy as other Disney animated features," [...] crediting this with making [...] "the film a bit tougher to warm [...] to." [...] ComingSoon.net strongly panned Simba as a lead character, writing, [...] "typically for Disney animated fare, it's the hero who is the weak link being both blandly designed and blandly performed." [...] Acknowledging the character's Shakespearean origins, The Baltimore Suns Stephen Hunter gave Simba a negative review, writing, [...] "Alas ...Simba stands in for Hamlet, but he's a lot less complicated; in fact, he's less complicated than Morris the Cat or Sylvester." [...] Hunter continued, [...] "Simba the Exile is even less interesting than Simba the Prince." [...] Christopher Null of Contactmusic.com was critical of Weaver's performance as the singing voice of Young Simba, writing, [...] "If there's anything annoying about the film, it's the singing. Young Simba sounds like a young Michael Jackson ... You almost don't want him to succeed." [...] However, Null reacted more positively towards Broderick's performance.|$|E

2500|$|Orvieto, {{sitting on}} its impregnable rock {{controlling}} the road between Florence and Rome where it crossed the Chiana, {{was a large}} town: its population numbered about 30,000 {{at the end of}} the 13th century.

In the 13th century bitter feuds divided the city, which was at the apogée of its wealth but found itself often at odds with the papacy, even under interdict.

2500|$|Angel {{is himself}} forever running {{some sort of}} (usually very bottom-of-the-barrel) con game, and is {{consistently}} ready to sell anyone out at a moment's notice for his own benefit — and often does. [...] In doing so, Angel almost always gets Rockford in trouble, usually by involving him in hare-brained scams...often without Jim's knowledge, and never with his consent. [...] As <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not,</b> Angel's antics result in Angel's, Jim's and/or others' arrests, and/or being placed on somebody's hit list. [...] In spite of this, Jim considers Angel {{as one of his}} best, if most exasperating, pals. [...] Towards {{the very end of the}} series, there is a noticeable cooling in Jim's attitude toward Angel in their often fractious relationship; however, the rift seems to have been repaired by the time of the reunion movies.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Calcutta was {{the centre}} of {{activity}} {{in the early stages}} of the national movement of independence. Exactly a hundred years after the fall of Bengal in the Battle of Plassey, Calcutta saw the beginning of what is often called the First Independence Movement of India. It should be noted here that it is also just as <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> referred to as a War of Independence, and as one historian put it, [...] "The so called First National War of Independence was neither First, nor National, nor a War of Independence". In the suburbs of Calcutta, at the Barrackpore military barracks, sepoy Mangal Pandey sparked off a huge revolt that shook the foundations of the British Empire. This movement is sometimes also called the Indian Mutiny, although recent evidence goes against using this name and suggests [...] "The Revolt of 1857" [...] as a better and less controversial choice.|$|E
