500|$|This {{period of}} Hassett’s career was notable for his battles with Australia's leading Test bowler, Bill O'Reilly, when the latter {{appeared}} for New South Wales (NSW). O'Reilly conceded that Hassett played his bowling {{better than any}} other batsman. Hassett's method was predicated on counter-attacking: whenever O'Reilly bowled his famed wrong 'un, he could read this delivery in its flight (whereas most other batsmen could not) and he advanced down the pitch to hit the ball over the fielders on the leg side. The disparate demeanours and physiques of the two men accentuated their rivalry. Ray Robinson wrote that O'Reilly, [...] "... towered nine inches above him; it would have looked more apt for Hassett to sell him a newspaper than contend with his bowling." [...] The phlegmatic Hassett sometimes goaded the irascible O'Reilly, which few batsmen were game to do. On one occasion, he repeatedly mis-hit O'Reilly's bowling, prompting an irritated O'Reilly to ask if he had a middle to his bat. Hassett replied, [...] "I don't need one with you, Tige." [...] It was a long, defensive innings of 81 against NSW (including O'Reilly) in 1937 that first brought Hassett {{to the attention of the}} national selectors. During an interval in the match, O'Reilly told his teammates: [...] "Nobody has ever kept me <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> little bastard." ...|$|E

He wears a vest and his hair looks like it was styled during a power cut. He runs along towpaths in skimpy orange swimming trunks and has a torso that's closer to a Party Seven than six pack. He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And he means it as a compliment.) In fact when you see Hunt's qualities spelled <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it looks appalling. [...] the fact remains: Gene Hunt is my guilty secret, and I know scores of other women feel the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> can get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
2500|$|... "Friday" [...] was {{revealed}} as YouTube's No. 1 video of 2011, with Black hosting a short video called [...] "YouTube Rewind" [...] in the year-end recap. Despite the over 167 million views {{during its first}} four months, prior to its temporary removal, [...] "Friday" [...] had amassed more than 3,190,000 [...] "dislikes". After the fallout with Ark Music Factory, Black started an independent record label named RB Records. She released a self-produced single titled [...] "My Moment" [...] on July 18, 2011, the first on her label, with an accompanying music video published to her YouTube channel the same day. In the video, director Morgan Lawley features real life footage of Black from {{both before and after}} her fame. In late October 2011, production began on the music video for Black's third single, [...] "Person of Interest". About the song, Black stated [...] "The basis of it is that it's a love song but it's not a love song. It's about almost teenage crushes – when you're not in love yet but you really like a guy – which I'm really excited about because I don't think there are too many <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It's very much a dance type song. It will make you get up and dance and sing along in your car." [...] The single and its accompanying music video were released on November 15, 2011. Black released two more singles in 2012: [...] "Sing It" [...] in May, and [...] "In Your Words" [...] in November. Black was planning to release her debut album in late 2011, which she said would include [...] "a bunch of different kinds of stuff." [...] The album was being recorded at a studio belonging to music producer Charlton Pettus. However, the album was never released. Black was featured in an ABC Primetime Nightline: Celebrity Secrets special entitled Underage and Famous: Inside Child Stars' Lives.|$|E
