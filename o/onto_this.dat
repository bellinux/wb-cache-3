But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

25|$|The {{approach}} of Cartan and Weyl, using connection 1-forms {{on the frame}} bundle of , gives a third way to understand the Riemannian connection. They noticed that parallel transport dictates that a path in the surface be lifted to a path in the frame bundle so that its tangent vectors lie in a special subspace of codimension one in the three-dimensional tangent space of the frame bundle. The projection <b>onto</b> <b>this</b> subspace is defined by a differential 1-form on the orthonormal frame bundle, the connection form. This enabled the curvature properties of the surface to be encoded in differential forms on the frame bundle and formulas involving their exterior derivatives.|$|E
25|$|In early 1984, Ben Baker was {{planning}} on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the McDonnell Douglas automotive division in St. Louis. Baker {{was part of the}} CP/M special interest group within the club. He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, CBBS system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that DEC would be giving them a Rainbow 100 computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS <b>onto</b> <b>this</b> machine. The Rainbow contained two processors, an Intel 8088 and a Zilog Z80, allowing it to run both MS-DOS and CP/M, with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the I/O ports, so CBBS could not communicate with a modem. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.|$|E

25|$|During 1848–1860 {{he was a}} {{reporter}} to the Statsutskottet (Procedure Committee). He was {{a strong supporter of}} Louis De Geer's 1863 electoral reform bill and the introduction of popular suffrage. Bildt was a skillful debater who recognized the legitimate arguments against the reform. He sought to build a consensus rather than engage in the politics of division. Finally, with two of the four estates on side and with a large public backing, he set about overcoming the House of Nobility's inevitable opposition to its own dissolution. Given the popular support for the reform, Governor Bildt had troops ready to maintain order in the capital, in the event of the bill being blocked. But the nervousness turned to rejoicing as the bill was accepted, finally receiving Royal assent on 22 January 1866 by King Karl XV. The unicameral legislature, representing the four estates, was replaced with a bicameral parliament, consisting of an Upper House of appointed members (Första kammaren) and a numerically superior and popularly elected Lower House (Andra kammaren). A committee was set up to define the procedures for the new Riksdag. Bildt was elected <b>onto</b> <b>this</b> committee with more votes than any other candidate.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges for their health giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de Nuits latched <b>onto</b> <b>this</b> royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the Côte de Nuits and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back through the walnut paneled dining room to either the drawing room or into the library. Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set into the ceiling. At night this room, like the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced <b>onto</b> <b>this</b> courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace opened onto a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|E

The portion of the thruway currently followed by I-287, including the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, opened on December15, 1955. In the 1960s, I-287 was designated along the New York State Thruway between Suffern and Tarrytown, while I-87 ran farther to the east on present-day I-684.
