500|$|Later {{production}} R engines featured sodium-filled {{exhaust valve}} stems for improved cooling, while additional modifications included a redesigned lower crankcase casting {{and the introduction}} of an <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> below the piston gudgeon pin; a measure that was carried over to the Merlin engine. A balanced crankshaft was introduced in May 1931, and the compression ratio on the [...] "sprint" [...] engines prepared for that year was raised from 6:1 to 7:1.|$|E
5000|$|Pistons {{are made}} of forged {{aluminum}}. They have three rings and aluminum buttons retain the 1.156 x 3.300 in steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during intake strokes as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|E
50|$|A {{year before}} the {{introduction}} of the MAE, the single overhead cam two valve SCA was introduced. It was a 997 cc engine based on Ford Cortina 116E block that was designed for Formula 2, and featured the first totally Cosworth-designed head, Laystall forged crankshaft, steel main bearing caps and pistons with only one compression ring and one <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> each. Cylinder head to block sealing was by a head gasket incorporating Cooper Rings. The basic configuration was quite similar to Coventry Climax FWE on Lotus Elite including its SOHC reverse-flow design, except for a series of 7 spur gears (1 on crank, 2 intermediary gears on 2 fixed shafts mounted on the front cover back plate, 1 on the 116E camshaft used as a jackshaft, 2 on a common fixed shaft in the head, 1 on the camshaft) driving a 5 bearing camshaft and the Ford 5 main bearing iron block. The intake ports and the oil scavenge pickup for dry sump lubrication were canted 25 degrees, so they faced straight up and down, respectively, when the engine is mounted 25 degrees from vertical to the right for a lower center of gravity.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether or}} not a properly located and properly designed <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> piston <b>ring,</b> installed on a piston provided with oil drain holes of sufficient area, would prevent the excessive oiling of the Liberty engine, particularly with the engine running at idling speed with full oil pressure. Results showed that excessive oiling was in fact prevented. It is strongly recommended that <b>scraper</b> <b>rings</b> and pistons be adopted for aircraft engines...|$|R
5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart. [...] Plastic parts included the engine block, cam cover, air intake trumpets, intake valve stems, piston skirts and wrist pins, connecting rods, <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> piston <b>rings,</b> tappets, valve spring retainers and timing gears.|$|R
50|$|Steel, H-section, fully {{machined}} {{connecting rods}} are fitted with four big-end bolts. Plain white metal big-end bearings and bronze bushes small-ends were employed.

50|$|Nitrogen {{is usually}} {{used as the}} gas instead of air, since it {{is less likely to}} cause corrosion. The various parts of the strut are sealed with O-rings or similar {{elastomeric}} seals, and a <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> is used to keep dust and grit adhering to the piston from entering the strut.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} assessment of some advanced Stirling engine component concepts are presented. High performance piston <b>rings,</b> reciprocating <b>oil</b> <b>scrapers</b> and heat pipes with getters and with mechanical couplings were tested. The tests yielded the following results: (1) Bonded, split, pumping piston rings, in preliminary testing, proved a promising concept, exhibiting low leakage and friction losses. Solid piston rings proved impractical in view of their sensitivity to the operating temperature; (2) A babbit <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> in a compliant housing performed well in atmospheric endurance testing. In pressurized tests the scraper did not perform well as a containment seal. The latter tests suggest modifications which may adapt Ti successfully to that application; and (3) Heat pipe endurance tests indicated the adequacy of simple, inexpensive fabrication and filling procedures. Getters were provided to increase the tolerance of the heat pipes {{to the presence of}} air and commercially available couplings were demonstrated to be suitable for heat pipe application. In addition to the above tests, the program also included a design effort for a split shaft applicable to a swashplate driven engine with a pressurized crank-case. The design is aimed, and does accomplish, an increase in component life to more than 10, 000 hours...|$|R
50|$|This poor {{combustion}} {{leads to}} soot formation and unburnt fuel residues which clogs and gums piston rings, causing a further drop in sealing efficiency and exacerbates the initial low pressure. Glazing occurs when hot combustion gases blow past the now poorly-sealing piston rings, causing the lubricating {{oil on the}} cylinder walls to 'flash burn', creating an enamel-like glaze which smooths the bore and removes {{the effect of the}} intricate pattern of honing marks machined into the bore surface which are there to hold oil and return it to the crankcase via the <b>scraper</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steel {{cylinder}} liners were screwed into the heads, with their lower parts projecting into the crankcase. Steel seats for valves and sparking plugs were shrunk into the heads. The pistons were forged from alugir, with three compression and one <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> and floating bronze bushes for the gudgeon pins. The twelve pistons {{were connected to}} the six crankpins in pairs, each with a master and an auxiliary connecting rod. The master rods had forked big ends with white metal bearings; the auxiliary rod ends ran between the forks on bronze bushes.|$|R
50|$|Gas sealing is {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} piston rings. These are a number of narrow iron rings, fitted loosely into grooves in the piston, just below the crown. The rings are split at a point in the rim, allowing them to press against the cylinder with a light spring pressure. Two types of ring are used: the upper rings have solid faces and provide gas sealing; lower rings have narrow edges and a U-shaped profile, to act as <b>oil</b> <b>scrapers.</b> There are many proprietary and detail design features associated with piston rings.|$|R
50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also controlling oil are primarily for compression sealing (compression rings); the lower ring is for controlling {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression rings (oil control rings). At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (top compression rings) or a taper napier form (second compression <b>rings</b> or <b>scraper</b> <b>rings).</b> There are some taper faced top rings and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R
2500|$|The Praga B2 was a dual ignition, {{air-cooled}} horizontal twin producing 40 horsepower (30kW) {{aimed at}} lightweight aircraft. [...] It was a higher compression version (6.7:1 {{from the earlier}} 5.72:1) of the original and otherwise very similar Praga B, which provided 36hp (27kW). [...] Its cylinders were machined from alloy steel forgings and had aluminium alloy heads. The pistons were of aluminium alloy, with three compression <b>rings</b> and one <b>scraper</b> <b>ring.</b> The connecting rods were of nitrided steel, with divided big ends and bronze bushes at the little ends. The one piece crankshaft was also formed from nitrided steel and had two main roller bearings and a single ball thrust bearing. The single piece crankcase was cast from an aluminium alloy.|$|R

This system is intended for monitoring and measuring localized beam losses. The Cerenkov {{radiation detection}} system includes a detector assembly mounted at selected locations in the storage ring tunnel and an electronics package in a VME format. The electronics package consists of a high-voltage power supply, a 16 -bit pulse discriminator-counter, two gated integrators, and two 16 -bit analog-to-digital converters. The design of the timing circuit offers an extended range of 655 µs for both the gated integrator gate width and gate delay.

40|$|This program aims at {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} advanced natural-gas reciprocating engines (ANGRE) by reducing piston/ring assembly friction without major adverse effects on engine performance, such as increased oil consumption and emissions. An iterative process of simulation, experimentation and analysis, are being followed towards achieving the goal of demonstrating a complete optimized low-friction engine system. To date, a detailed set of piston/ring dynamic and friction models have been developed and applied that illustrated the fundamental relationships between design parameters and friction losses. Various low-friction strategies and ring-design concepts have been explored, and engine experiments have been done on a full-scale Waukesha VGF F 18 in-line 6 cylinder power generation engine rated at 370 kW at 1800 rpm. Current accomplishments include designing and testing ring-packs using a subtle top-compression-ring profile (skewed barrel design), lowering the tension of the oil-control ring, employing a negative twist to the <b>scraper</b> <b>ring</b> to control <b>oil</b> consumption. Initial test data indicate that piston ring-pack friction was reduced by 35 % by lowering the oil-control ring tension alone, which corresponds to a 1. 5 % improvement in fuel efficiency. Although small in magnitude, this improvement represents a first step towards anticipated aggregate improvements from other strategies. Other ring-pack design strategies to lower friction have been identified, including reduced axial distance between the top two rings, tilted top-ring groove. Some of these configurations have been tested and some await further evaluation. Colorado State University performed the tests and Waukesha Engine Dresser, Inc. provided technical support. Key elements of the continuing work include optimizing the engine piston design, application of surface and material developments in conjunction with improved lubricant properties, system modeling and analysis, and continued technology demonstration in an actual full-sized reciprocating natural-gas engine...|$|R
30|$|The most straightforward, antique {{and widely}} used {{technique}} for solving wax problems inside wells is mechanical removal (Irwin 1955). It {{is common to}} let the paraffin accumulate inside the flowing wells, until a certain amount, and then remove it using mechanical devices. In <b>oil</b> wells, usually, <b>scrapers</b> and cutters are used to remove paraffinic deposits (Al-Yaari and Fahd 2011). There are generally two types of tools: one that cuts the deposit from the tubing and allow the producing oil {{to bring it to}} the surface, and another one that scraps and removes the deposit from the tubing. Figure  6 shows an example of a schematic wax cutter used to cut deposits from the casing (left) and from the tubing (right), without interfering with the production.|$|R
