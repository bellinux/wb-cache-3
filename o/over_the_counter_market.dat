40|$|The {{profits of}} many {{businesses}} are strongly affected by weather related events, and insurance against weather related risks (acts of God) {{has been a}} traditional domain for transfer of (certain) of these risks. Recent innovations in the capital market have now provided financial instruments to transfer and hedge some of these risks. Unlike insurance solutions, however, using these financial derivative instruments creates {{a situation in which}} the return to the purchaser of the instrument is no longer perfectly correlated with the loss experienced. Such a mismatch creates new risks which must be examined and evaluated as part of ascertaining cost effective risk management plans. Two newly engendered risks, basis risk (the risk created by the fact that the return from the financial derivative is a function of weather at a prespecified geographical location which may not be identical to the location of the firm) and credit risk (the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract may not perform), are analyzed in this article. Using custom tailored derivatives from the <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>market</b> can decrease basis risk, but increases credit risk. Using standardized exchange traded derivatives decreases credit risk but increases basis risk. Here also the effectiveness of using hedging methods involving forwards and futures having linear payoffs (linear hedging) and methods using derivatives having nonlinear payoffs such as those involving options (nonlinear hedging) for the purpose of hedging basis risk are examined jointly with credit risk.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} hedging {{activities}} of oil. More particularly, I investigate {{the case study}} example of British Airways (BA). The issues that examined in this paper include what types of risk BA is facing, the types of financial derivative instruments BA's using to hedge against its risks, effectiveness of BA's hedging, the extent of its derivatives usage, and a numerical example showing derivative instruments {{can be used to}} hedge against the movement of oil price risk and which derivative is more effective. I found out that the use of financial derivatives by BA is for hedging purpose, but not for speculative or trading purposes. BA is facing financing and interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk and other risks. Therefore, BA employs a mixture of swaps, options, forward and futures to hedge against these risks. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against near-term foreign exchange risk, uses interest rate swaps to hedge against financing and interest rate risks, and uses a number of derivatives that are available <b>the</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>markets</b> (such as options and forward contracts).

40|$|While the {{succession}} of pro-competition measures (or ‘packages’) for gas at the EU level since the early 2000 s certainly favoured {{the development of the}} continental trading hubs, their progress has faced headwinds from dominance on the supply-side by long-term contracts which, until recently, were almost exclusively priced in relation to oil products. However, in the 2008 to 2011 period, a surge of LNG supply to Europe, growing accessible pipeline connectivity, supplier choice for end-consumers and a protracted period in which hub prices were considerably below those of oil-indexed contract prices, together catalysed the development of liquidity at these hubs. Some upstream suppliers came to embrace this transition, others continue to resist; but in the downstream markets hub development has been generally assisted by co-operation between system operators and regulators. Despite favourable outward signs of progress, in order to assess {{the degree to which the}} European traded hubs have matured to the point where they can be said to represent a reliable and representative ‘market price’ requires extensive data and quantitative analysis. In this context Beatrice Petrovich’s paper is a truly landmark work. What sets it aside from previous research is that it incorporates OTC (<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter)</b> <b>market</b> data. Through access to data from brokers (The Tankard Parties: ICAP Energy Limited, Marex Spectron Group and Tullett Prebon Group Limited) who in aggregate represent some 80 % to 90 % of the European gas OTC market, Beatrice’s analysis was able to incorporate anonymised price and volume data on every trade on every European hub considered since January 2007. The degree of price correlation between hubs demonstrated by this analysis provides compelling support for the hypothesis that the European hubs do provide a reliable price reference. Where anomalies occur they can be related either to hub immaturity in early periods or to physical connectivity constraints. </p...|$|E
40|$|The OTC {{derivatives}} markets {{all over}} the world have shown tremendous growth in recent years. In the wake of the present financial crisis, which {{is believed to have been}} exacerbated by OTC derivatives, increasing attention is being paid to analysing the regulatory environment of these markets. In this context, we analyse the regulatory framework of the OTC derivatives market in India. The paper, inter alia, seeks to prove the point that the Indian OTC derivatives markets, unlike many other jurisdictions, are well regulated. Only contracts where one party to the contract is an RBI regulated entity are considered legally valid in India. A good reporting system and a post-trade clearing and settlement system, through a centralised counter party, has ensured good surveillance of the systemic risks in the Indian OTC market. From amongst the various OTC derivatives markets permitted in India, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards are the two prominent markets. However, by international standards, the total size of the Indian OTC derivatives markets still remains small because credit default swaps were conspicuously absent in India until now. It appears that Indian OTC derivatives markets will grow fast once again after the present financial crisis is over. This research paper explores those open issues that are important to ensure market stability and development. On the issue of the much discussed competition between exchange-traded and OTC-traded derivatives, we believe that the two markets serve different purposes and would contribute more to risk management and market efficiency, if viewed as complementary. Regarding the introduction of new derivative products for credit risk transfer, the recent announcement by the RBI that it would introduce credit default swaps is a welcome sign. We believe that routing of credit default swaps through a reporting platform and managing its post-trade activities through a centralised counterparty would provide better surveillance of the market. Strengthening the position of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) as the only centralised counterparty for Indian OTC derivatives market and better supervision of the off-balance sheet business of financial institutions are two measures that have been proposed to ensure the stability of the market.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Of recent {{interest}} to academics, {{policy makers and}} practitioners is the role that liquidity plays in market outcomes. The aim of this thesis is to explore the measurement and cross-sectional drivers of liquidity, {{as well as the}} impact of liquidity risk, in the U. S. secondary corporate loan market (herein loan market). The loan market is a dealer-driven and relatively opaque <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>market.</b> It is also a relatively illiquid market, yet trading volumes are economically significant, totalling USD 628 billion in 2014. Importantly, since 2008 additional liquidity data has become available on the loan market. The thesis comprises three empirical studies. The first study begins with an examination of alternative measures of liquidity, which is followed by an investigation of liquidity risk and its drivers. Principal component analysis and canonical correlations analysis are used to determine the most effective measure of liquidity in the loan market. I find that the bid-ask spread and a measure of quote dispersion are the most effective measures of liquidity, with a preference for the bid-ask spread due to its wide applicability and ease of calculation. In Study 1, liquidity commonality, a common measure of liquidity risk, is used to examine liquidity risk in the loan market, {{and the extent to which}} any liquidity risk varies over time. Liquidity commonality shows an 18 -fold increase during the 2007 - 2009 global financial crisis over its pre-crisis level, implying substantial variation in liquidity risk across market states. Substantial variation in liquidity commonality is also consistent with the vulnerability of the loan market to weakness in the banking and shadow-banking sectors. There is some evidence that liquidity risk in the loan market is decreasing in funding liquidity, consistent with supply-driven theoretical explanations such as Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009). The findings are robust to the use of quote dispersion as an alternative measure of liquidity. If liquidity has an important impact in loan markets, it is critical that we understand why some loans are more liquid than others, which I examine in Study 2. The starting point is the liquidity drivers established in both the theoretical and empirical literature, including inventory costs, adverse selection costs and dealer competition. In particular, I focus on any economic rents accrued by dealers, which may be more significant in less transparent dealer driven markets. A key aspect of the analysis is the ability to examine “paired” loans; loans issued by the same borrower on the same day with identical credit ratings. This is an alternative to the asset matching methods often used in the literature, and provides the opportunity to test the direct effect of dealer market power on spreads. High dealer concentration in the loan market increases bid-ask spreads by 12 - 14 basis points, equivalent to $ 672 million of additional transaction costs per annum. This does not imply that alterative market structures or increased transparency will eliminate economic rents, rather it offers context for examining the potential costs and benefits of alternative structures or reporting requirements. Further, there is no evidence that the ability of dealers to extract economic rents is moderated by the ability of investors to access willing counterparties directly. Consistent with theoretical predictions, inventory costs are a key driver of bid-ask spreads. There is weak evidence that bid-ask spreads are increasing in adverse selection costs, although the impact is limited to higher quality loans. Again, the results are robust to the use of dispersion as an alternative measure of liquidity. Finally, the impact of shocks to liquidity and liquidity risk on yields in the loan market are examined. Liquidity shocks are disentangled from shocks to default risk using a novel method that extends Bali, Peng, Shen, and Tang (2014). Loans that experience shocks to either liquidity or default risk experience ongoing price declines, complementing evidence presented elsewhere of price momentum in loan markets. The prices of loans with high liquidity risk are significantly discounted when market liquidity is low, consistent with the time-varying funding liquidity constraints of financial intermediaries. There is mixed evidence of a liquidity premium that is sustainable outside of periods of low market liquidity. This result is consistent with the time-varying nature of liquidity risk, and various other features of the loan market. For example, loans are typically callable and have limited scope to trade significantly above par. The results are also consistent with Acharya et al. (2013), who show that liquidity risk is conditional on stress regimes and may explain why previous studies that have examined the unconditional effect of liquidity risk in the loan market have found that liquidity risk is not priced (Ehsani and Beyhaghi, 2015). In keeping with a close link between high risk debt markets and equity markets, there is evidence that equity market risk is priced in the loan market, an important consideration for investors when considering portfolio diversification strategies...|$|E
