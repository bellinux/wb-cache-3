5000|$|Waxy corn (maize) {{was found}} in China in 1909. As this plant showed many {{peculiar}} traits, the American breeders long {{used it as a}} genetic marker to tag the existence of hidden genes in <b>other</b> <b>maize</b> breeding programs. In 1922 a researcher found that the endosperm of waxy maize contained only amylopectin and no amylose starch molecule in opposition to normal dent maize varieties that contain both. Until World War II, the main source of starch in the USA was tapioca but when Japan severed the supply lines of the States, they forced processors to turn to waxy maize. Amylopectin or waxy starch is now used mainly in food products, but also in the textile, adhesive, corrugating and paper industry.|$|E
50|$|The first {{described}} and most extensively researched {{example is the}} r1 locus in maize. The gene at this locus, when actively transcribed, codes for a transcription factor that promotes anthocyanin production, resulting in kernels with a purple color. One allele at this locus, referred to as B’, is capable of causing methylation at the other allele, B-I. This methylation results in reduced transcription and, as a result, decreased anthocyanin production. These alleles do not differ in DNA sequence, but they do differ in their degree of DNA methylation. As with other examples of paramutation, this change of the B-I allele to the B’ allele is stable and heritable. Other, similar examples of paramutation exist at <b>other</b> <b>maize</b> loci, {{as well as in}} other plants such as the model system Arabidopsis thaliana and transgenic petunias.|$|E
5000|$|And when Collins found such a {{distinct}} {{difference in the}} appearance of normal and waxy maize endosperm, he suspected a difference in chemical composition, but the analysis did not yield any unusual results. The percentages of starch, oil, and protein were all within the normal range. Yet, he was intrigued by the physical nature of the starch, and wrote: “In view of the recent development of specialised maize products as human food, the unique type of starch may be of some economic importance." [...] So actually, for many years the main use of waxy maize was a genetic marker for <b>other</b> <b>maize</b> breeding programs. Breeders {{were able to use}} some of the traits to “tag” the existence of hidden genes and follow them through breeding programs. It is possible that waxy maize would have become extinct again in the USA without this special application in breeding.|$|E

40|$|Genetic fine {{structure}} {{analysis of the}} maize wx locus has determined that the ratio of genetic to physical distance within wx was one to two orders of magnitude {{higher than the average}} for the maize genome. Similar results have been found at <b>other</b> <b>maize</b> loci. In this study, we examined several mechanisms that could account for this pattern. First, crossovers in two <b>other</b> <b>maize</b> genes resolve preferentially at specific sites. By mapping exchanges between wx-B 1 and wx-I relative to a polymorphic SstI site, we found no evidence for such a hotspot at wx. Second, deletion of promoter sequences from wx alleles had little effect on recombination frequencies, in contrast to results in yeast where promoter sequences are important for initiating recombination in some genes. Third, high levels of insertion polymorphism may suppress intergenic recombination. However, the presence of a 2 -kb Ds element 470 bp upstream of the wx transcription start site did not further suppress recombination between Ds insertions in nearby wx sequences. Thus, none of these mechanisms is sufficient to explain the difference between intergenic and intragenic recombination rates at wx...|$|E
