50|$|The {{company is}} owned by the Robinson family. Its founder is Jerry Robinson (b. 1920). Robinson {{purchased}} the White Center News in 1952, founded the Federal Way News in 1954, expanding it into Des Moines in 1963. He acquired the Highline Times and the West Seattle Herald in 1974. With his partner Al Sneed, he developed <b>Rotary</b> <b>Offset</b> Publishing Company in 1956, installing the first web <b>offset</b> style <b>rotary</b> printing <b>press</b> west of the Mississippi River. Robinson sold the papers in 1989 but restarted them in 1998 after the then publisher ceased operations. He had previously acquired the Ballard News Tribune and the Monroe Monitor in 1993.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{factors which}} the author {{believes}} could contribute to {{the determination of the}} aesthetic and economic viability of producing original fine art prints and artists books on a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> using direct imaged, uncoated lithographic plates. It also introduces a new medium for the creation and production of these works which was developed during this study. This investigation has been accomplished in the following ways: First, answers were sought to ten questions the author believed any artist considering the use of a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> as a means of producing these works would want to know. The answers were obtained through direct experimentation with a variety of plates which were processed by different procedures and then printed on a <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press.</b> The author concludes {{on the basis of this}} experimentation that when the artist 2 ̆ 7 s intentions for a specific work coincide with the capabilities of this production process as described in the answers, then this process can be considered aesthetically viable. Second, five-hundred copies of a sixteen page artists book were produced by the author to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this production process for a specific work. The results indicated that a substantial saving in labor, time, and expense was obtained when this process was employed. There were also substantial savings to the integrity of the work. The author concludes that this process is aesthetically and economically viable for the production of this type of artists book. Third, a survey of commercial printers was undertaken to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this process in cases where the artist does not have access to a suitable offset press. All the people interviewed indicated that their firms would be willing to accept for production plates imaged and processed by the artists. They also indicated that they would be willing to meet the artist 2 ̆ 7 s specifications for the work when these were obtainable, and that the total cost would be based principally on the hourly rate for the specific press being used. On the basis of these and other results of this survey, the author concludes that the production of original fine art prints and artists books by commercial lithographers can be aesthetically and economically viable for the production of certain works. Fourth, people professionally involved in the creation, printing, publishing, selling and collecting of these works were surveyed to assess their usage, awareness, and attitudes regarding their offset press production. The response data to one question in the survey allowed calculations to be made of the acceptability of this process to the total population of the types of people surveyed. As a result of these calculations, conclusions were made that seventy-six percent believe this process is acceptable for the production of original fine art prints. Similarly, one-hundred percent believe it is acceptable for the production of artists books. And fifth, the origins, principles, processing procedures, advantages, and disadvantages of a new medium for the creation and production of original prints and artists books are presented. This medium utilizes direct imaging techniques and light sensitive coated lithographic plates. It is presented for the first time in this study. Any artist wishing to learn about this new medium and any artist considering <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> production of original fine art prints or artists books, will find much useful in formation in this study. A portfolio of thirty prints accompanies this study to provide the reader with a firsthand view of the results of the experimentation...|$|R

5000|$|Two years earlier, in 1871, the two {{engineers}} Louis Faber and Adolf Schleicher {{founded the}} company Faber & Schleicher as an “Association for Production of Automatic Lithographic Presses” in Offenbach am Main. This city {{has played a}} very important part in the history of lithography because it was here that Alois Senefelder built his first lithographic stone presses for the André music publishing company. Faber & Schleicher built their first automatic litho stone press in 1879, the “Albatros”, which had an output of 600 to 700 sheets per hour. Along with the experience and know-how gained from lithography as well as printing on zinc and other metal plates, the real breakthrough came with the emergence of offset printing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. The inventors Ira Washington Rubel and Caspar Herrmann took over the indirect printing principle known from printing on metal plate and developed this new process between 1904 and 1907. Faber & Schleicher’s specialization in offset printing began in 1911 with the model “Roland”, the world’s first sheetfed <b>rotary</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press,</b> which was awarded a gold medal at the World Fair in Turin.The name Roland was chosen because [...] "Faber & Schleicher" [...] can hardly be pronounced in English-speaking regions.|$|R

Rotary drum printing was invented by Richard March Hoe in 1843. An 1844 patent replaced the reciprocating platforms used in earlier designs with a fixed platform served by rotating drums, and {{through a series of}} advances a complete <b>rotary</b> printing <b>press</b> was perfected in 1846, and patented in 1847. Some sources describe the Parisian Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni as the inventor of the <b>Rotary</b> printing <b>press,</b> but this {{was the subject of a}} patent dispute that was decided in Hoe's favor.

5000|$|Besides the {{automatic}} cylinder press, the 19th century saw another innovation in printing press construction and a newspaper publisher was behind this as well. Around 1850 {{the question was}} being asked whether the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> principle was suitable for letterpress printing. John Walter III, publisher of [...] "The Times" [...] in London, commissioned the two engineers J.C. MacDonald and John Calverly to develop and build the world's first <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> for newspaper printing. This {{became known as the}} “Walter press”. In June 1872, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg sent its development head Gustav Bissinger to England. Fact-finding visits by German engineers to factories and workshops in England, the leading industrial nation of that era, were not uncommon in those days. After that the first <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> from Maschinenfabrik Augsburg was quickly designed. Although it also worked on the Walter principle, it was smaller and lighter and easier to operate. In May 1873 it was presented at the World Fair in Vienna.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s or early 1940s, <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> had {{increased}} substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press {{was capable of}} performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.|$|R

40|$|The {{cause of}} {{register}} errors that develops in a rotogravure printing press under particular conditions of printing speed has been analysed. The print defect in magazines causes waste printed paper and prevents from fully exploiting the productive {{capacity of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> It has been observed that the defect is {{not consistent with the}} natural vibrations of the rotating bodies in contact with the paper during the printing process. A new approach based on the analysis of the register markers printed on the pages of a magazine, has allowed to show a probable oscillatory phenomenon of the entire <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> structure, not easy otherwise detectable. This new method consists on the reconstruction and interpretation of the curve corresponding to a series of register markers printed along a line of a paper sheet. It has been so possible to determine that the cause of the print defect is due to the oscillations at low frequency of the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> structure. A simplified model of the deformations of the tightened paper web confirms the results...|$|R

50|$|Bullock {{moved to}} Pittsburgh, {{and in a}} couple of years, perfected a {{printing}} press called the web <b>rotary</b> <b>press.</b> Richard March Hoe had invented the <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|R
50|$|Flong is a {{term used}} in relief {{printing}} (also called a stereo mould), which refers to an intermediate step in making of a stereo plate typically used in a <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> though not exclusively. The process was called stereotyping.|$|R
50|$|Several {{extremely}} rare stamps {{from this period}} sometimes misidentified as coil waste were actually produced from the waste printing of sheet stamps. These include another 1¢ Franklin issue (Scott #596) and the perforated 11 <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> Harding Memorial stamp (Scott #613).|$|R
5000|$|Die cutting {{can be done}} {{on either}} flatbed or <b>rotary</b> <b>presses.</b> <b>Rotary</b> die cutting is often done inline with printing. The primary {{difference}} between rotary die cutting and flatbed die cutting is that the flatbed is not as fast but the tools are cheaper. This process lends itself to smaller production runs where {{it is not as}} easy to absorb the added cost of a rotary die.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{came into}} use for {{printing}} stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the paste-up phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could {{be produced by}} the press and merely needed to be cut into strips.|$|R
50|$|Coil {{waste is}} a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or {{unusable}} printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on <b>rotary</b> <b>presses,</b> a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat plate presses), coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> printing slightly stretches an image.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Richard Hoe of New York was {{developing}} {{a more efficient}} horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>press</b> which as available with two, four, six or ten impression cylinders. The first one of this type was imported by Edward Lloyd in 1856 and was soon adopted by many newspapers including The Times.|$|R
50|$|Spray powder is {{not used}} on <b>rotary</b> <b>presses</b> {{including}} <b>rotary</b> letterpress, web <b>offset</b> (often used for printing magazines), flexographic (often used for printing flexible packaging and labels) or gravure (often used for printing long-run catalogues). Similarly, spray powder is not generally used in sheet-fed (silk) screen-printing, ink-jet or toner based digital printing.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, the {{linotype}} and {{a technique}} called stereotyping, a process for molding semi-circular printing plates for the new <b>rotary</b> <b>press,</b> were introduced. Before the newspaper got its first linotype machine - it would add two more in 1913 and, eventually own 13 before they were replaced by computer-generated typesetting in the 1970s - all type was hand set.|$|R
