50|$|After Belarus gained {{independence}} from the USSR in 1991, Belarusian State University was officially recognized as a leading establishment {{of higher education in}} the new nation. New faculties and institutes were created: the Faculty of International Relations (1995), the State Institute of Management and Social Technologies (2003), the Military Faculty (2003), the St. Methodius and Cyril Theological Institute (2004), the Humanities Faculty (2004); the Institute of Business and Technology Management (2006), the Confucius Institute for Sinology (2007). In 2008 the Faculty of Journalism was reorganized into the Institute of Journalism. The university also established university preparation and continuous education centers. Several new research centers were founded as well: the Centers for Particle and High Energy Physics (1993), <b>Ozonosphere</b> Monitoring (1997), Applied Problems in Mathematics and Informatics (2000), and Human Problems (2000). New buildings were constructed for the Faculties of Biology, Philosophy and Social Sciences, and International Relations, the Institute of Journalism, and the university television center. In {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, monuments to a number of prominent Belarusian historical figures - Francysk Skaryna, Mikołaj Hussowczyk, Euphrosyne of Polotsk, Cyril of Turaw, Symon Budny and Wasyl Ciapiński - were erected on campus.|$|E

The result is as follows: so far as the total heat given to the lower part of the troposphere is up to approximately three times more than the total heat given to {{the upper part of}} the ozonosphere; (1) the physical quantities in the troposphere are much influenced, but those in the mesosphere are little influenced, by this tropospheric heating, (2) the northerly wind component has two nodes in the region below 25 km, (3) at least in the troposphere, the more the total heat given in the troposphere is, the stronger the vertical wind component becomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between varves (visibly striated rocks deposited by glacial run-off) and solar radiation is discussed, proposing that {{the thickness of}} any given varve represents the mean annual sunspot number for {{the year in which}} the varve was laid down. The solar cycle may entail a deep torsional oscillator whose influence reaches the surface by wave propagation. Several observed features suggest a wave link between the source of solar activity and its surface manifestations. It is suggested that the cause of varve modulation is solar UV and X-ray radiation, which exerts solar cycle influence in the <b>ozonosphere</b> and ionosphere. The undulations and cycles of the Elatina varve bed formation in South Australia are related to solar phenomena. The varve mechanism is significant for the build-up of the protective shield of biogenic oxygen in the palaeoatmosphere...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow {{progressively}} occults {{a part of}} the Earth {{from the}} solar flux. This induces a cooling in the atmospheric layers that usually absorb the solar radiation. Since the eclipse shadow travels within the atmosphere at supersonic velocity, this cooling generates a planetary-scale bow-wave of internal gravity waves. The {{purpose of this article is}} to estimate the surface pressure fluctuations produced by the passage of the 1 August 2008 total solar eclipse and to compare these pressure fluctuations with those recorded by a temporary network of microbarographs and by the infrasound stations of the International Monitoring System. The surface pressure fluctuations expected at all the measurement sites are estimated using a linear spectral numerical model. It is shown that the cooling of both the <b>ozonosphere</b> and the troposphere can produce detectable pressure fluctuations at the ground surface but that the tropospheric cooling is likely to be the predominant source. Since the expected eclipse signals are in a frequency range that is highly perturbed by atmospheric tides and meteorological phenomena, the pressure fluctuations produced by these synoptic disturbances are characterized and removed from the recorded signals. Low-frequency gravity waves starting just after the passage of the eclipse are then brought to light at most measurement sites. The time-frequency characteristics of these waves are similar to those obtained from the model, which strongly suggests that these waves were produced by the passage of the 1 August 2008 solar eclipse...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Coal is known as black gold, the food of industry. It {{has been used as}} one of the main energies for human being since the 18 th century. Although its important place has been taken by petroleum nowadays, due to the daily drying up of petroleum for quite a period of time in the future, the large quantity of coal reserves and with the rapid development of science and technology, especially maturity and wide use of integrated coal gasification technology, coal will become one of the energies that cannot be replaced in human life and production.

40|$|Non-renewable energy {{resources}} {{in the guise of}} fossil fuels are the basic source for industry, energetics, transport and households. Amid the alarming reports on the subject of depleting resources of fossil fuels, a lot of countries promote the use of renewable energy sources. However, plenty of countries still maintain their traditional ways of producing energy. For instance, those countries use coal, which is very harmful to the environment because it destroys the <b>ozonosphere</b> or causes respiratory failure to people. Because of that, many organization perpetually struggle, encumbering enormous fines for companies or countries in general. The costs of installation can be quite high at first but in the course of time, these investments bring dividends. Using renewable energy sources, such as wind power, hydropower, solar energy, the geothermal energy, and biomass, is very attractive, especially for big companies. The difference in price between the conventional and unconventional way to generate energy might be minimal but multiplied by thousands this small difference becomes a big amount that companies could save. Therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to get up-to-date information about work parameters, particular generative departments, identify places where can be excessive energy consumption, gathering data, reporting and further analyzing results, and for energy management and visualization of the whole system. Thank to the wireless connection between regulatory PC and remote units, which is the TCP/IP network, it is feasible to obtain plenty of measurements in outlying and very often unavailable places for people. The software used on this project was Saia PG 5 Controls Suite, created to program controllers of the Saia Burgess Controls company. It uses logic that is universal and does not depend on controllers of other companies. Furthermore, the PG 5 contains a whole set of tools, which was sufficient to create the SCADA system without the need to use any other softwares...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{understand}} reality behind the planetary influences on human behaviour which is also known as “Gauquelin effect” with a scientific approach. There is a vast scope for scientific study on the above topic. Water is the most abundant chemical compound in living human cells, accounting for 65 - 90 % of each cell. Each water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom, but the mass of each oxygen atom is much higher than the combined mass of the hydrogen. All organic compounds contain carbon, which is why carbon is the second most abundant element in the body. Six elements account for 99 % of the mass of the human body: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Although aluminum and silicon are abundant in the earth's crust, they are found in trace amounts in the human body. The human body is made up of materials and minerals found {{on the surface of the}} ground, and not from the core of the earth. Oxygen, being the most abundant element on the earth's crust or on the ground, makes up 65 percent of the human body, and carbon, also abundant on the top soil of the ground, is 18 percent, and hydrogen is 10 percent. The exact proportion of the minerals and materials, if maintained, make up a healthy human body. Excesses in these materials will cause disorders and diseases. Excess of aluminum, for example, and iron, will be toxic for the human body. The proportions of the abundance of the 59 elements on the earth's crust, is amazingly represented in its presence in the human body.
