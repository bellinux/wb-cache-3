5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
40|$|The gradual {{decomposition}} of genetic potential {{is referred to}} degeneration, which is a world wide problem of maintaining stability <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> yield.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of drought {{stress on the}} photosynthesis rate, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, the activity of protective enzymes <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> and the biomass fresh weights <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> leaves at seedling stage were investigated, using two different varieties <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> with significant difference in drought resistance to carry out potted plant experiment with water control. Under mild and medium drought stresses, the two potato varieties stabilized the photosynthetic organ functions by light capture reduction, heat dissipation and the regulation of enzyme activity. The damage of photosystem II and antioxidant enzyme system was the non-stomatal limitation factors for the decrease of the photosynthesis rate under serious drought stress. The influence on the physiological parameters <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> Kexin No. 1 was weaker than that <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> Kexin No. 12 under drought stresses.

Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person farming {{community}} of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph – the son of an alcoholic who had immigrated from Ireland – had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but had given it up due to his teammates' heavy drinking, gambling and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George's mother was the former Frances McLean, born c. 1890 and initially raised in Ontario; her family had later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota looking for work as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern's salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form <b>of</b> <b>potatoes,</b> cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} <b>of</b> <b>potatoes</b> and gibberish sentences being {{in line with the}} pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{potato tubers}} had {{received}} the exogenic action, water and starch in tubers generated tougor pressure which would act on cell walls in the tuber tissue, so starch content and water ratio have an obvious effect on the mechanical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> tubers. In order to provide a mechanical method for detecting the starch content <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> tubers, correlation between viscoelastic characteristics and starch content of tubers was studied. In the research, the tubers <b>of</b> Desiree <b>potato</b> were compressed by cylindrical probe, and showed nonlinear stress-strain curves. The viscoelastic model <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> tuber was established, and its viscoelastic parameters were determined. Meanwhlie, the starch content and water ratio <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> tuber were detected after mechanical tests, and the correlation between viscoelastic parameters and starch content was analysed. According {{to the results of}} correlation analysis, viscosity coefficient which had been obtained from the viscoelastic model was significantly correlated with starch content and water ratio.
