40|$|This {{dissertation}} draws {{a portrait}} <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> are frequently stereotyped in modem society, particularly by the media. This dissertation aims to go some way towards redressing this through providing a portrait <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values that has integrity for <b>young</b> <b>people</b> {{and for the}} researcher. <b>Young</b> <b>people's</b> values are explored through qualitative and quantitative research methods; through focus groups, and {{by means of a}} new instrument for assessing <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values devised in this study, the Halsall-Francis Values Inventory (HaFVI). This study analyses the responses <b>of</b> 2, 973 <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to the HaFVI. This dissertation is divided into two parts. In part one, chapter one presents an overview of the study; its thesis, methodology, and an explanation of the terminology used. Chapters two and three evaluate qualitative and quantitative data already available regarding <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values. Chapter four presents data from the focus groups. Chapter five describes {{the way in which the}} focus group data were utilised in the design of the HaFVI, and the method for the dissemination of the HaFVI. Part two of this dissertation presents a quantitative map <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values. Chapter six provides a background profile <b>of</b> the <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> and chapter seven introduces the profile <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values. Chapters eight to 25 each focus on an area <b>of</b> the <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values from the values-map generated in this study, portraying detail regarding the <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values in each area. The dissertation concludes with a summary <b>of</b> the <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> values, portrayal <b>of</b> factors of significance when considering these values, and discussion of the implications of the findings of this study...|$|R

5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of citizens attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved {{to assist in the}} transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 52,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
40|$|One {{aspect of}} the ICCS study’s {{measurement}} <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> citizencompetence is “civic engagement”. In this article {{it is argued that}} even though the study’s assessment captures important aspects <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> civic engagement, too strong educational reliance on it may contribute to meagreness in the educational assignment to see to an engaged citizenry. By providing deeper insight into the ICCS study’s assessment rationale, and by presenting qualitatively derived examples <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> civic engagement, it is suggested that in order to see to fruitful ways of approaching the educational task <b>of</b> providing for <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> civic engagement, we need to maintain openness to different depictions of civic engagement.

5|$|Emigration <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten {{per cent}} of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required {{to continue their education}} full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
50|$|Japanese society, by its Confucianistic ideology, {{generally}} hesitates {{to respect}} rights and dignities <b>of</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> and newer participant people.

40|$|In Australia, {{wellbeing}} {{has been}} used as an assessment <b>of</b> how <b>young</b> <b>people</b> are doing by health researchers, youth researchers and psychologists. The concept "wellbeing" is increasingly applied to <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in their late teens and early twenties with little discussion <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> perspectives. Using quantitative measures of subjective wellbeing as well as qualitative interviews to allow <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to discuss the concept of wellbeing, this study explored the levels and meanings of wellbeing among 91 <b>young</b> <b>people</b> (aged 16 - 24) from a rural center in south-east Australia. Key components <b>of</b> wellbeing for <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were found to include relationships, psychological dimensions and personal issues while family and 'pressure' impacted wellbeing. For most <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> wellbeing was multidimensional, holistic and centred around their own lives. Findings suggest that the Deiner et al. satisfaction with life scale was an appropriate measure <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> wellbeing but that health, sociology of youth and psychological approaches all contribute to <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> perspectives <b>of</b> wellbeing and need to be incorporated into a more holistic measure <b>of</b> SWB for <b>young</b> <b>people...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples.

5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training.

Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.
