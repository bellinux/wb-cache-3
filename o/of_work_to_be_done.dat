Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in parallel is also independent of the number of processors, whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in parallel varies linearly with the number of processors.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fields' {{literary}} importance lies {{primarily in}} two areas: {{one is the}} influence she exerted over {{her husband in the}} selection <b>of</b> <b>works</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published by Ticknor and Fields, the major publishing house of the time. He valued her judgement as reflecting a woman's point of view.|$|R
25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, {{and there is some}} method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches {{is the way in which}} the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
25|$|Professional diving {{operations}} are usually formally planned {{and the plan}} documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that the scope <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> is {{within the scope of}} the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.|$|E
500|$|The band {{finished}} {{recording the}} new album in mid-2011. When Martin and Champion were interviewed by BBC Radio and asked about the album's lyrical themes, Martin replied [...] "It's about love, addiction, OCD, escape and working for someone you don't like." [...] When asked {{whether or not their}} fifth album would be out by the summer, Martin and Champion said that there was plenty <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> before releasing it. They confirmed several festival appearances before its release date, including a headlining spot at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Rock in Rio, and Lollapalooza festival.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War. He also commented on the war in Afghanistan, on which he said [...] "There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> of which the military is only a very small part. Ten years, 15 years, long-term. This {{is not going to be}} solved in a short term". In the same month, he gave {{an interview}} for The Sunday Times, in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.|$|E

2500|$|Lothar Ruben-Wolf took a {{job with}} the All Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (WIEM) where he ws set to work on fascist race theories. [...] Martha Ruben-Wolf was {{employed}} as a gynaecologist In The Eighth Moscow Abortion clinic. [...] She was disappointed to find that in the eyes of senior colleagues her German qualifications and experience counted for very little. [...] There was plenty <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> but she experienced the absence of professional status acutely. [...] A particular disappointment came in June 1936 when the Soviet Union reverted to the more conservative stance on birth control already enforced in Germany, and abortion, a topic as politicised in the Soviet Union as in the west, again became illegal. [...] As the political climate in Moscow turned increasingly ugly, Martha Ruben-Wolf experienced four months of unemployment, and then was given a relatively poorly paid job with Intourist, the state tourism agency. [...] The leader was becoming increasingly paranoid. [...] German political refugees who had come to Moscow in search of safety were increasingly in danger of being identified and denounced as Trotskyites or agents of the German government or both.|$|E
