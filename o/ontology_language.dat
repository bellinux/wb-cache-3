2500|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and knowledge engineering {{are central to}} AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of [...] "what exists" [...] is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web <b>Ontology</b> <b>Language.</b> The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as SWRL rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{semantic}} web <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> RDFS and OWL {{are widely used}} but limited in both their expressivity and their support for modularity and integrated documentation. Expressivity, modularity, and documentation of formal knowledge have always been important issues in the MKM community. Therefore, we try to improve these <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> by well-tried MKM techniques. Concretely, we propose OM-Doc as an alternative. We show how OMDoc can be made compatible with {{semantic web}} <b>ontology</b> <b>languages,</b> focusing on knowledge represen-tation, modular design, documentation, and metadata. We evaluate our technology by re-implementing the Friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) ontology and applying it in a novel metadata framework for technical documents (including ontologies). 1 EdNote(1) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ontology</b> <b>languages</b> to {{represent}} <b>ontologies</b> exist in large numbers, and users {{who want to}} access or reuse ontologies can often be confronted with a language they do not know. Therefore, due to their great number, <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> are nowadays themselves a source of heterogeneity. In this paper, we present the SIRUP Ontology Query API (SOQA) that was devel-oped for the SIRUP approach to semantic data integration [ZD 04 b]. SOQA is an ontol-ogy language- and platform-independent API for query access to ontological metadata and data that can be represented {{in a variety of}} <b>ontology</b> <b>languages.</b> Based on SOQA, we provide SOQA-QL, an SQL-like query language that supports declarative queries against ontological metadata and data, and the SOQA Browser, a tool to graphically inspect all ontology information that can be accessed through SOQA. ...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{system for}} ontology-based data access should provide {{meaningful}} answers to queries {{even when the}} data conflicts with the ontology.

Unfortunately, query answering under the CQA semantics {{has been shown to be}} computationally intractable, even when extremely simple <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> are considered. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing two new families of inconsistency-tolerant semantics which approximate the CQA semantics from above and from below and converge to it in the limit. We study the data complexity of conjunctive query answering under these new semantics, and show a general tractability result for all known first-order rewritable <b>ontology</b> <b>languages.</b> We also analyze the combined complexity of query answering for <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> of the DL-Lite family...|$|R

These languages (SHOE, XOL, RDF, OIL, etc) aim to represent the knowledge contained in an ontology in a simple and human-readable way, as well as allow for the interchange of ontologies across the web. In this paper, we establish a common framework to compare the expressiveness and reasoning capabilities of "traditional" <b>ontology</b> <b>languages</b> (Ontolingua, OKBC, OCML, FLogic, LOOM) and "web-based" <b>ontology</b> <b>languages,</b> and conclude with the results of applying this framework to the selected languages...|$|R
