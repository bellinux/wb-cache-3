40|$|Blood lactate {{has been}} used to {{determine}} the aerobic capacity and long distance performance. Recently, a new methodology has been suggested to supplant the invasive blood lactate techniques. Salivary lactate has received attention because it shows high correlation to blood lactate in progressive <b>overload</b> <b>test.</b> We evaluated the correlation between salivary and blood lactate during a long distance run and assessed possible changes in salivary lactate concentration. Fifteen expert marathon racers ran 30 km as fast as possible. Saliva and 25 mu L of blood were collected at rest and at each 6 km for lactate determination. Blood lactate concentration increased in the 6 th km and then remained constant {{until the end of the}} race. Salivary lactate increased after 18 km in relation to basal. We found high correlations between blood and saliva absolute lactate (r= 0. 772, p < 0. 05) and the blood lactate relative concentration corrected by protein- (r= 0. 718, p < 0. 05). the highest correlation found between absolute and relative salivary lactate was r= 0. 994 (p < 0. 001). Our results show that it is possible to use salivary lactate with absolute values or relative protein concentration. in addition, salivary lactate showed a high correlation with blood lactate in endurance events.

40|$|Disaccharide {{intolerance}} {{presents a}} pathogenic heterogeneous and most complex clinical entity. It usually occurs due to primary or secondary deficit of disaccharide activity, and rarely because of disorders of absorption or monomer metabolism. Symptomatology of disaccharide maldigestion and/or malabsorption {{depends on the}} severity of the basic disorder, the level of its overload and the patient’s age. In the youngest children, due to a rapid gastrointestinal transit and a low compensatory capacity of the colon, osmotic-fermentative diarrhoea forms the basis of clinical features. Diarrhoeal disorder can be occasionally so intensive that it disturbs not only water and electrolytic balance, but also the nutritive status of the child. In older children and adults, as well as in milder forms of the disorder, the symptomatology, most often without diarrhoea, is dominated by abdominal colic, loud peristaltic sounds, meteorism and increased flatulence. Metabolic disorders followed by conversion disorders of galactose and fructose into glucose are characterized by a hypoglycaemic crisis, as well as by various multisystemic damages due to the deposit of toxic metabolic products. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal forms of disaccharide intolerance is based on the pathologic clinical and laboratory response during the <b>overload</b> <b>test,</b> while that of the metabolic form is based on the confirmed presence of specific enzyme and/or genetic defect. Treatment of disaccharide intolerance is based on the elimination diet. Besides, in the secondary forms of the disorder, it is also necessary to apply the treatment of the basic disease...|$|E

40|$|In {{consideration}} {{of the difficulty of}} monitoring internal deformation in dam model tests, a new optical fiber sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology has been developed. Quasi-distributed FBGs are installed on a slender bar (circular cross-section) along axial direction to make an FBG sensing bar. For the dam physical model in this study, FBG sensing bars can be embedded in predrilled holes within the dam structure and the dam foundation. When the dam is loaded by hydraulic jacks and dam deformations occur, the sensing bar works like an elastic beam under arbitrary transverse and axial loading. According to the bending beam theory, the distribution of both horizontal and vertical displacements can be calculated from the strains measured by the FBGs. The two sensing bars used in the test were calibrated in the laboratory before testing. The calibration results have shown that the displacements measured by the sensing bars were in good agreement with those obtained using other conventional gauges. Recently a two-dimensional gravity dam model was constructed and instrumented with two embedded FBG sensing bars, together with surface mounted displacement transducers and strain rosettes. In the <b>overload</b> <b>test,</b> all the sensors were used to perform real-time monitoring of the model dam deformation. Major monitoring results are presented, compared and analyzed. The displacements measured by the FBG sensing bars in the dam model test are in good agreement with those from displacement transducers. The test results also reveal the deformation mechanism and failure mode of the gravity dam. 考虑到大坝模型试验中内部变形难以监测的现状,研制了一种新型的基于光纤布拉格光栅(FBG) 技术的光纤传感器。这种传感器为圆棒式结构,其表面沿轴向安装了准分布式的光纤布拉格光栅。对于大坝物理模型,该传感器可预埋入坝体和坝基的内部。当大坝受到油压千斤顶荷载产生变形时,该传感器类似于一根一端固定并同时受轴向拉、压和横向弯曲的弹性梁。根据弯梁原理,由光纤布拉格光栅测得的应变结果可反算出大坝沿水平向和竖向的位移分布。室内标定试验结果表明,该传感器测得的变形量与其他常规传感器的读数一致。在一个二维混凝土重力坝物理模型的超载破坏试验中,采用预埋于坝体、坝基内部的光纤传感器以及表面安装式位移计、电阻应变花对该模型进行实时的变形监测。试验结果验证了该光纤传感器在大坝模型内部变形监测中的有效性,同时也揭示了大坝在超载作用下的变形机制和破坏形态。Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|SEEC, Incorporated, is {{developing}} a collapsible intermodal container (CIC{trademark}) designed for containment and transport of fly ash and other dry-flowable bulk commodities. The CIC is specially configured to ride in open top rail cars, but as an intermodal container, it also rides in barges and on flat bed trailers. This allows SEEC to use unit coal train back haul capacity to transport fly ash to markets at and near coal mines. SEEC`s goals for this project were to design a CIC for handling and transporting dry fly ash, and then demonstrate the CIC technology. During this project, SEEC has performed extensive initial design work, leading to the manufacture of three prototype CICs for demonstration. Preliminary tests to examine safety issues included finite element analyses and an <b>overload</b> <b>test</b> in which the CIC was lifted while carrying weight in excess of its rated capacity. In both cases, the CIC met all safety requirements. With the above information satisfying possible safety concerns in hand, SEEC worked with SIU and other cooperators to plan and carry out field demonstration and testing of three CICs. This demonstration/testing including filling the CICs with fly ash, transporting them in a coal hopper car, handling with standard intermodal equipment, and emptying by inverting (two CICs) and by vacuuming (one CIC). Results were very positive. Filling with fly ash, transporting, and intermodal handling went very well, as did emptying by vacuum. Emptying by inverting was less successful, {{but most of the}} problems were predicted ahead of time, and were mostly due to lack of fly ash fluidizing equipment as much as anything.

Fifty volunteers with low bone mass were grouped according to their serum 25 (OH) D concentration as follows: mild deficient, < 50 nmol/L (DEF) and sufficient, a parts per thousand yen 75 nmol/L (SUF). the subjects were submitted to an oral strontium <b>overload</b> <b>test</b> to assess their Abs-Ca. Fasting blood samples were obtained to perform the relevant hormonal and biochemical tests. After the subjects received the test solution, blood samples were drawn at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min to determine the strontium concentrations. Abs-Ca was indirectly expressed as the area under the serum strontium concentration curve (AUC). A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to determine the differences among the groups. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to study the associations between the variables. the mean 25 (OH) D and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25 (OH) (2) D] concentrations differed between the groups (SUF vs. DEF) as follows: 98. 7 +/- A 18. 2 vs. 38. 4 +/- A 8. 5 nmol/L (p < 0. 001) and 36. 2 +/- A 10. 2 vs. 24. 9 +/- A 4. 6 pg/mL (p < 0. 001), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for parathyroid hormone and AUC. Only 1, 25 (OH) (2) D influenced the strontium absorption in the last 2 h of the test. in the studied population, no correlation between levels of 25 (OH) D and Abs-Ca was found. Only 1, 25 (OH) (2) D influenced Abs-Ca as measured by a strontium absorption test.

In the <b>overloading</b> <b>test,</b> the greased plates of IPs were replaced by new ones at different time intervals. Additional validating tests were conducted in different animal houses (pigs and poultry), in a technical lab, and in ambient air. Seventy-five pairs of 24 -h measurements, 36 for PM 10 and 39 for PM 2. 5, consisting of results for 1 IP and 2 CPs were obtained in total.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe International Organization of Standardization (ISO) has {{developed}} test protocols that quantify {{the physical and}} mechanical characteristics of wheelchair seat cushions that are considered relevant to their influence on tissue integrity (ISO 16840 - 2). The draft standard contains a total of nine test methods, of which we have focused on four tests, namely recovery, load-deflection and hysteresis, lateral and forward stiffness, loaded contour depth and overload deflection. The first goal {{of this study was}} development of the recovery test protocol. Recovery characterizes the short-term (25 sec) and long-term (20 min) resilient tendencies of a cushion. The test was repeated three times on three sets of eight cushions. The same sets of cushions were tested by two other laboratories to verify protocol reproducibility. The test had high intra-lab repeatability, but low inter-lab reproducibility. The reproducibility is affected mainly due to the high sensitivity of the test. The results also suggested that the long-term recovery test be converted to a pass or fail binary test. The goal of {{the second part of the}} study was to implement these tests and to evaluate their reliability by analyzing their repeatability and ability to differentiate between the cushions. Each test was run on a set of 21 commercially available cushions. Reliability and repeatability was evaluated using the ICC (intra class correlation coefficient) and RC (repeatability coefficient). The load-deflection and hysteresis characterizes the cushions' hysteresis at 8 N, 250 N and 500 N. The 250 N value was the most reliable measure. The lateral and forward stiffness test measures the peak and 60 sec force required to displace the cushion indenter by 10 mm. The test showed high reliability. The loaded contour depth (LCD) and overload deflection test measures the cushions' depth of immersion in loaded (135 N) and overloaded (180 N) states. The LCD test was also highly reliable. However, lack of variability for the <b>overload</b> <b>test</b> suggests that it be converted into a binary test, to check if the cushion has bottomed out or not. The recovery test displayed high intra-lab repeatability, but its reliability is questionable due to its poor ability to distinguish between cushions. Overall, the test results suggest that time interval between replications should be increased to atleast 30 mins to reduce the potential of a systematic trend between readings. The RC can be used as a precision statement for each test, thus giving us a baseline for acceptable variations between its replications. In order to validate these tests completely, we need to establish inter-lab reproducibility, conduct research to investigate the clinical resolution for each test and clinically validate these test parameters...|$|E

Comparisons were made between test data generated on the C(T) specimens with test data from the literature on middle-crack-tension, M(T), specimens machined from the same sheet. A crack-closure analysis was used to collapse the rate data from both specimen types into a narrow band over many orders of magnitude in rates using proper constraint factors.

The calculated crack-growth lives under CA loading were generally within about ± 25 % of the test results, but slower crack growth under the double-shear fatigue mode, unlike the single-shear mode (45 ° slant crack growth), may be the reason for some of the larger differences.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 American Society for Bone and Mineral ResearchUNLABELLED: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of overload in orthogonal directions on longitudinal and transverse mechanical integrity in human vertebral trabecular bone. Results suggest that the trabecular structure has properties that act to minimize the decrease of apparent toughness transverse to the primary loading direction. INTRODUCTION: The maintenance of mechanical integrity and function of trabecular structure after overload remains largely unexplored. Whereas a number of studies have focused on addressing the question by testing the principal anatomical loading direction, the mechanical anisotropy has been overlooked. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of overload in orthogonal directions on longitudinal and transverse mechanical integrity in human vertebral trabecular bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T(12) /L(1) vertebral bodies from five cases and L(4) /L(5) vertebral bodies from seven cases were retrieved at autopsy. A cube of trabecular bone was cut from the centrum of each vertebral body and imaged by microCT. Cubes from each T(12) /L(1) and L(4) /L(5) pairs were assigned to either superoinferior (SI) or anteroposterior (AP) mechanical testing groups. All samples were mechanically tested to 10 % apparent strain by uniaxial compression according to their SI or AP allocation. To elucidate the extent to which overload in orthogonal directions affects the mechanical integrity of the trabecular structure, samples were retested (after initial uniaxial compression) in their orthogonal direction. After mechanical testing in each direction, apparent ultimate failure stresses (UFS), apparent elastic moduli (E), and apparent toughness moduli (u) were computed. RESULTS: Significant differences in mechanical properties were found between SI and AP directions in both first and second <b>overload</b> <b>tests.</b> Mechanical anisotropy far exceeded differences resulting from overloading the structure in the orthogonal direction. No significant differences were found in mean UFS and mean u for the first or second <b>overload</b> <b>tests.</b> A significant decrease of 35 % was identified in mean E for cubes overloaded in the SI direction and then overloaded in the AP direction. CONCLUSIONS: Observed differences in the mechanics of trabecular structure after overload suggests that the trabecular structure has properties that act to minimize loss of apparent toughness, perhaps through energy dissipating sacrificial structures transverse to the primary loading direction.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} <b>overload</b> <b>tests</b> on two 1 / 8 th scale prestressed concrete bridge girders. The three span continuous girders were made with three pretensioned I-section girders, and were made continuous for live loads by means of reinforcement in the composite cast-in-place deck. The structures were originally built {{as part of a}} study of the long-term behavior of prestressed concrete bridges. The structures were loaded with a model HS-type vehicle loading which was positioned to produce either high shears or approximately maximum moments in the various spans. The final tests produced very large deformations!» and the maximum loads reached were in the range of 93 to 99 percent of the theoretical collapse loads. The behavior of the structures is described in terms of measured load deflection and load-reaction curves, together with descriptions of the cracking that occurred {{as a result of the}} several loadings. Comparisons of measured and computed deflections, reactions, and cracking moments are made. The service-load deflections were generally smaller than expected, and the cracking moments larger than expected. State of Illinois Department of TransportationU. S. Department of Transportation.

40|$|The {{stability}} {{of a large}} cavern group at great depth is discussed {{on the basis of}} large-scale three-dimensional (3 -D) geomechanical model tests and numerical simulations. The model tests are described in detail. Improvements in the tests were made in terms of experimental techniques and advanced measurement methods. The model tests utilized active loading on six sides of a rock mass in a true 3 -D stress state. During the model construction, precast blocks were fabricated and monitoring holes were defined prior to test initiation. Newly developed combination ball-sliding walls were installed on each of the major loading surfaces to reduce the friction induced by model deformation. A unique grouting and installation technique employing prestressed cables was adopted in the tests. A digital photogrammetric technique, displacement sensing bars using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology, and mini multipoint extensometers were developed for measuring deformation. <b>Overloading</b> <b>tests</b> were then conducted for different overburden depths, and 3 -D numerical analyses were performed to simulate the testing procedures. Conclusions regarding the {{stability of}} the cavern group were developed based on a comparison between the experimental and numerical results.

40|$|Abstract:- Roller {{conveyors}} are conventionally used to convey/transport cartons, FMCG goods. The conventional {{roller conveyor}} was either toothed belt driven or PU cord driven. The roller and the conventional belt conveyors have a speed limiting value of 45 metres/minute. In {{the current day}} industrial scenario, looking at the increasing demands of the end customer, the speed limit of 45 metres/minute had to be overcome and increased to a higher level. For this purpose a narrow belt driven live roller conveyor {{has been designed to}} deliver goods at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute. In this drive mechanism, a narrow belt is running continuously below the rollers, tangentially driving them. A special 3 layered belt with acrylonitrile- butadienerubber as the rough surface {{on both sides of the}} belt and polyester (PET) fabric as the traction layer material is used. Special crowned nylon material plastic pulleys have been injection moulded for self-tracking and to guide the belt throughout the 5 metre long conveyor. Several experiments like: load test, slippage test, pull <b>test,</b> current <b>overloading</b> <b>test,</b> temperature test, lower speeds test have been performed to study the behaviour of the belt under various conditions. On the basis of the experimental results, further modifications have been done in the conveyor design. The final results show that this conveyor can convey 35 kgs of unit load per metre at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute within a permissible slippage range of 1 - 1. 5 %. The higher the load, the higher the slippage is and lesser is the belt life. The system was also kept under simulation run for continuous 6 month...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEspecially {{for carbon}} fiber sport bicycle frames and {{components}} the existing standards for fatigue tests dońt satisfy the needs {{to ensure the}} athletes safety as numerous failure cases in field show. In order to determine realistic loading pattern for fatigue tests, operational loads for typical usage and reasonable foreseeable misuse have to be known. To determine the occurring operational loads a test bicycle has been developed. For field measurements a standardized test terrain was selected. Additionally special situations were performed to determine operational loads in so-called “possible misuse” situations. Rainflow analysis was carried out for the data mining of typical load cases. Peak forces quantify the possible misuse situations. Analyzing the operational loads related to typical use caused a Rainflowmatrix established for each point of measurement. This data is then used as basis {{for the development of}} dynamic fatigue tests on special test benches. According to the peak forces in possible misuse situations additional static tests are suggested to ensure the product safety under extreme use. The enhanced test methods suggested in this paper try to improve existing product tests by taking foreseeable misuse situations into account. The addition of static <b>overload</b> <b>tests</b> to the dynamic test protocol aims to increase the product safety, as existing test protocols dońt consider high static loads. However additional field tests have to be carried out in order to approve the actual results...|$|R
