40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{multiscale}} (frequency-dependent) relationship between technical trading profitability and feedback trading {{effects in the}} Canada/U.

The results suggest that technical trading activities of <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> drive frequent violations of the FX market microstructure assumption that exchange rate movements are driven by order flow. After controlling for transaction costs, {{we find that the}} contribution of <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> in feedback trading dominates the contribution of non-financial customers, especially at lower frequencies. An additional, novel contribution is that technical indicators constructed from order flows can be profitable...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the USD/EUR-trading {{of a small}} bank in Germany over a fourmonth period and thereby complements previous analyses of large market makers. Our data comprehensively differentiates deal-by-deal trading information between other banks, commercial customers and the increasingly important <b>financial</b> <b>customers.</b> Results reveal that these differences play an insignificant role for inventory control. However, information levels between groups clearly differ. Correspondingly, cumulative order flows of incoming interbank and <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> trades are informative, even at the small bank. Spreads and profits increase for trading with less informed counterparties. Proprietary trading seems to be profitable...|$|R

40|$|Though {{unambiguously}} outperforming all <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> {{markets in}} terms of liquidity, foreign exchange trading is still performed in opaque and decentralized markets. In particular, the two-tier market structure consisting of a customer segment and an interdealer segment to which only market makers have access {{gives rise to the}} possibility of price discrimination. We provide a theoretical foreign exchange pricing model that accounts for market power considerations and analyze a database of the trades of a German market maker and his cross section of end-user customers. We find that the market maker generally exerts low bargaining power vis- 1 -vis his customers. The dealer earns lower average spreads on trades with <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> than commercial customers, even though the former are perceived to convey exchange-rate-relevant information. From this perspective, it appears that market makers provide interdealer market liquidity to end-user customers with cross-sectionally differing spreads...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the roles of}} order flow (reflecting private information) and news (reflecting public information) in explaining exchange rate volatility. Analyzing four months of a bank’s high frequency US dollar-euro trading, three different kinds of order flow are used in addition to seasonal patterns in explaining volatility. We find that only larger sized order flows from <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> and banks – indicating informed trading – contribute to explaining volatility, whereas flows from commercial customers do not. The result is robust when we control for news and other measures of market activity. This strengthens the view that exchange rate volatility reflects information processing. exchange rate, market microstructure, order flow, <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> orders, volatility patterns...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behaviour of end-user order flows {{in the foreign}} exchange market around periods of intense and large-scale intervention activity by the Bank of Japan. First, we find very limited evidence that corporate customers are affected in the desired way by intervention. However, there is somewhat stronger evidence that profit maximising <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> are adversely affected. Second, using a regression framework we again find evidence that corporate customers react in ways consistent {{with the intentions of}} the Bank of Japan, while <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> act in the opposite way. The aggregate impact of intervention to buy the dollar is, if anything, to increase net purchases of the yen by the customers of the bank we analyse. Finally, we find very clear evidence that intervention matters in a microstructure analysis. The strong contemporaneous correlation between order flows and exchange rate changes observed in many studies essentially disappears on days in which the Bank of Japan intervenes...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset that covers 100 % of the Brazilian FX retail market, this paper {{contributes}} to the microstructure approach to exchange rates in at least four ways. First, we find a strict link between currency flows in the FX market and the Balance of Payments. Second, we develop an identication strategy in order to properly estimate the effect of customer order fl?ows on the exchange rate and ?find that dealers from the Brazilian FX market charge a premium of 0. 03 % {{in order to provide}} US$ 10 million of overnight liquidity. Third, we identify the nature of the feedback trading as "stabilizing"?: a 1 % depreciation rate decreases the <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> fl?ow by US$ 111 million and the commercial fl?ow by US$ 46 million. Finally, we find that the central bank sells in average US$ 28 million for each 1 % depreciation in the exchange rate (lean-against-the-wind), and US$ 23 million for US$ 100 million of <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> flow (liquidity provision) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{if there}} is a relationship between competition time and team valuation, revenue and profitability in North American professional sport. The leagues examined were the major four in North America and include the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and the National Football League. Using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as a guide, appropriate literature of the four BSC categories was reviewed. The four categories of the BSC include <b>Financial,</b> <b>Customer,</b> Internal Business Processes and Learning and Growth. Conceptual models for team valuation, revenue and profitability were constructed using the BSC as a framework. In order to construct the three conceptual models 51 professional sport research variables were identified as useful to this framework. The data was collected over a ten-year period for the seasons 2003 / 2004 - 2012 / 2013. A series of statistical analyses were examined with regression analyses revealed three distinct models for the three dependent variables. It was found that competition time has a significant impact on all three dependent variables. The results from this study will help league executives in creating new strategies for revenue growth and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> gains. Future research will work towards creating more competition time variables that will aid in determining the proper amount of competition time that needs to be played by each league to maximize league finances...|$|R
