40|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area shift {{measurement}} {{is to find}} <b>the</b> coordinates (location) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> pattern <b>of</b> one two-dimensional {{sequence in}} the second two-dimensional sequence. It is supposed that searched pattern is included in <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> sequence in <b>the</b> unknown location. As {{it was published in}} [3], it is possible to determine the area shift using either the correlation or difference method. The calculations using <b>the</b> definition equations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlation or difference method are very severe. This contribution shows how it is possible to significantly decrease needed amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculation operations when appropriate characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compared two-dimensional sequences are used. The method, which uses histogram comparison, allows eliminating up to 90 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> patterns from <b>the</b> calculations that use the definition equations. The method that uses <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> pattern segments reaches even better results. It can eliminate up to 99. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>searched</b> patterns. Both new eliminating methods significantly contribute to acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area shift calculation...|$|R

5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search.</b> In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case}} of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E

Initially based in Perth, Western Australia, the JACC offices were relocated in May 2014 to Canberra, although they can be quickly relocated to Perth if necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for such a route.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E

5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During the first days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search,</b> the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off {{to participate in the}} rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
5|$|The search {{team and}} {{equipment}} {{had to be}} organised within four months, {{to take advantage of}} a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to stream video from the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.|$|E
