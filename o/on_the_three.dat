Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E

Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E
5|$|Gladstone {{is served}} by the Gladstone School District, which {{includes}} John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School.

The majority (approx. 26 million) of the money was applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 percent on its total ($805,040), with savings to begin in the 2024 tax year.|$|E

The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also new to the series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle had {{finished}} the 199596 Football League season in fourth place in the Third Division, one place ahead of Darlington.

On {{the final day of the}} league season, Plymouth Argyle had the opportunity to finish third in the table and thereby clinch the final automatic promotion place but a 30 win at Home Park against Hartlepool United was not enough to overtake Bury, after they also won 30 at home to Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the album}} was {{conducted}} in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000) and Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000).

Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. Voodoos sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician Eric Clapton.
