5|$|Before {{the formal}} start <b>of</b> <b>naming,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the mythological function <b>of</b> <b>names</b> in Greek myths, emphasizing though {{that most of}} the observed functions are not typical in mythology in general. Names were collected from the general work “Görög mitológia [Greek Mythology]” (1977 / 1997) by KÁROLY KERÉNYI, a scholarly book paying attention even to the different versions of the myths, and, occasionally, from the popular work “Görög regék [Greek Tales]” (1976) by IMRE TRENCSÉNYI-WALDAPFEL. The research focuses rather on the overall mythological function <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and name types, and also on the interrelations <b>of</b> <b>names</b> than on the etymologies <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Topics presented in the paper include the specific transitionary state <b>of</b> mythological <b>names</b> between common and proper nouns and the frequent changes between these two categories; the synonymity <b>of</b> <b>names</b> (e. g. in connection with the several <b>names</b> <b>of</b> a god); <b>names</b> compressing the storyline of a myth; the appearance <b>of</b> a new <b>name</b> as a linguistic manifestation of the change in one’s mythological role; pseudonyms as indicators of temporary mythological roles; and the magic function <b>of</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the Caribbean, United States and Canada, the name Hazel was retired, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. However, since it was retired before the {{inception}} <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> lists with the modern six-year cycle, it was not directly replaced with any particular name.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} continue with the current practice <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> hurricanes after women, but developed a new set of names ahead of the 1955 season with the names Carol, Edna and Hazel retired for the next ten years. However, before the names could be written, a tropical storm was discovered on January 2, 1955 and named Alice. The Representative T. James Tumulty subsequently announced that he intended to introduce legislation that would call on the USWB to abandon its practice <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> hurricanes after women, and suggested that they be named using descriptive terms instead. Until 1960, forecasters decided to develop a new set of names each year. By 1958, the Guam Weather Center had become the Fleet Weather Central/Typhoon Tracking Center on Guam, and had started to name systems as they became tropical storms rather than typhoons. Later that year during the 1958–59 cyclone season, the New Caledonia Meteorological Office started to name tropical cyclones within the Southern Pacific. During 1959 the US Pacific Command Commander in Chief and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that the various US Navy and Air Force weather units would become one unit based on Guam entitled the Fleet Weather Central/Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which continued naming the systems for the Pacific basin.|$|E

5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{started in}} 1960, with four sets <b>of</b> female <b>names</b> initially {{designed to be}} used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> had been used, {{it was decided to}} return {{to the top of the}} second list and to start recycling the sets <b>of</b> <b>names</b> on an annual basis. In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> The WMO selected six lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists <b>of</b> hurricane <b>name</b> would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> have been used, with <b>names</b> <b>of</b> significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.|$|R
5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} {{seaborgium}} were produced in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States.

It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time <b>of</b> <b>naming,</b> the other being oganesson, element 118.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the change <b>of</b> <b>named</b> {{entities}} over time and its influence on the performance <b>of</b> the <b>named</b> entity tagger. First, we analyze Japanese named enti-ties which appear in Mainichi Newspaper articles published in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2005. This analysis reveals that the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types and the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity tokens are almost steady over time and that 70 ∼ 80 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types in a certain year occur in the articles published either in its succeeding year or in its preceding year. These facts lead that 20 ∼ 30 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types are replaced with new ones every year. The experiment against these texts shows that our propos-ing semi-supervised method which com-bines a small annotated corpus and a large unannotated corpus for training works ro-bustly although the traditional supervised method is fragile against the change <b>of</b> <b>name</b> entity distribution. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start <b>of</b> <b>naming.</b> The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems {{in a brief}} form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public.

5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with storms named after places, saints or things they hit before the formal start <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> in each basin.

Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{provides}} a definition <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and {{a discussion of}} how the semantic-pragmatic properties <b>of</b> <b>names</b> determine their grammatical characteristics {{in a number of}} European and African languages. We argue that names are definite nouns with unique denotation that display an inherent basic level sense. The approach developed in this chapter aims at being universally valid in two ways. First, the pragmatic-semantic concept <b>of</b> <b>names</b> is cross-linguistically applicable. It is distinct from language-specific grammatical categories <b>of</b> Proper <b>Names,</b> for which language-specific grammatical criteria should be adduced. Second, our approach takes into account all types <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> We point out a cline of nameworthiness that is grammatically relevant...|$|R
