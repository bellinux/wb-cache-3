5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> of the Oort cloud {{defines the}} cosmographical {{boundary}} of the Solar System {{and the extent of}} the Sun's Hill sphere. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ordering}} is by set inclusion, {{then the}} <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> will always contain the inner limit (i.e., limnbsp&infnbsp&X'n ⊆ limnbsp&supnbsp&X'n). Hence, {{when considering the}} convergence of a sequence of sets, it generally suffices to consider the convergence of the <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> of that sequence.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} of the VIM is to extend {{the exploration of the}} Solar System beyond the outer planets to the <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> and if possible even beyond. The Voyagers continue to search for the heliopause boundary which is the <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> of the Sun's magnetic field. Passing through the heliopause boundary will allow the spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind.|$|E

Burke arrived at the Cooper on 11 November and they formed a depot at Camp LXIII (Camp 63) while they conducted reconnaissance to the north. A plague of rats forced the men to move camp and they formed a second depot further downstream at Bullah Bullah Waterhole. This was Camp LXV (Camp 65) and they erected a stockade and named the place Fort Wills.|$|E

25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{long-term}} use include rider {{familiarity with the}} bicycle and a mode of travel that is always nearby and instantly ready for use. The bicycle can be checked out like a library book, a liability waiver can be collected at check-out, and the bike can be returned any time. A Library Bike in a person's possession can be chosen for some trips instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance {{in order to keep}} the bike in running order during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain, and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.|$|E

500|$|However, {{one member}} of the Board, Admiral Joseph Reeves—who had {{previously}} been one of the principal developers of the United States' aircraft carrier strategy—disliked [...] "XVI-C" [...] because he believed that it was not fast enough to work with the [...] fast carriers, and it was not powerful enough to justify its cost.

2500|$|Using the {{standard}} parlance of set theory, set inclusion provides a partial ordering on {{the collection of}} all subsets of X that allows set intersection to generate a greatest lower bound and set union to generate a least upper bound.

[...] In this context, the inner limit, liminfX'n, is the largest meeting of tails of the sequence, and the <b>outer</b> <b>limit,</b> limsupX'n, is the smallest joining of tails of the sequence.

2500|$|The {{size of the}} Mackenzie hotspot is {{considered}} to have been about [...] in diameter.

However, if subhorizontal flow is a result of dike ascent to a level of impartial lightness in the Earth's crust, it would not be related to the size of the Mackenzie plume. Instead, the analysis of dike swarm geometry could possibly maintain evidence for the smallest diameter of the Mackenzie plume. The <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> separating the zone of fanning dike geometry and subparallel dikes might be suggestive of the smallest diameter for the Mackenzie plume because it is not probable that the stress related to a magmatic zone has consequence over a region that is lesser than the Mackenzie plume, which created the feature. From this analysis, the smallest diameter of the Mackenzie plume would have been about [...] Uranium-lead dating of certain Mackenzie dikes from an array of distances from an assigned focal point give an age of [...] million years. This indicates that the Mackenzie hotspot essentially emplaced the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province as a whole throughout the associated landscape. The associated Mackenzie plume is consistent with mantle plumes that have deep origins within the Earth's mantle.|$|E
