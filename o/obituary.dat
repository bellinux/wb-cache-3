40|$|<b>Obituaries</b> do {{not only}} {{announce}} {{the death of}} a significant other but also provide insights into how a society deals with death according to the norms governing the rituals of individuals within that society. This study aimed at investigating possible differences between German and Dutch <b>obituaries,</b> specifically in terms of visual and textual elements, information about the deceased, and funeral ceremony-related information. Data used to address the research questions were the contents of 240 German and 240 Dutch <b>obituaries</b> published in 10 different newspapers (6 in Germany, 4 in the Netherlands). Results of this study show that statistically significant differences between German and Dutch <b>obituaries</b> exist. While German <b>obituaries</b> use illustrations more than Dutch ones, Dutch <b>obituaries</b> provide more information, in general, than their German counterparts. The types of deceased-related information on German and Dutch <b>obituaries</b> also vary significantly. Moreover, Dutch <b>obituaries</b> provide more funeral ceremony-related information than German <b>obituaries...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Obituaries</b> are an {{especially}} rich resource for identifying people’s values. Because <b>obituaries</b> are succinct and explicitly intended to summarize their subjects’ lives, {{they may be}} expected to include only the features that the author(s) find most salient, not only for themselves as relatives or friends of the deceased, but also to signal to others in the community the socially-recognized aspects of the deceased’s character. We report three approaches to the scientific study of virtue and value through <b>obituaries.</b> We begin by reviewing studies 1 and 2, in which <b>obituaries</b> were carefully read and labeled. We then report study 3, which further develops these results with a semi-automated, large-scale semantic analysis of several thousand <b>obituaries.</b> Finally, we present the results of study 4 in which individuals were asked to write prospective <b>obituaries.</b> Geography, gender, and elite status all turn out to influence the virtues and values associated with the deceased...|$|R

5|$|In 1976, Chéreau staged Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Bayreuth Festival to {{celebrate}} the festival's centenary, termed the Jahrhundertring. The production, celebrating 100 years after Wagner's work had been performed {{for the first time}} as a cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival, became known as the Jahrhundertring (Centenary Ring). Chéreau collaborated with conductor Pierre Boulez, who had recommended him to the festival direction. The French team revolutionised the understanding of Wagner in Germany, as music critic Eleonore Büning wrote in her <b>obituary</b> in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Chéreau set the scene in the time of the composition, with a critical view of the time's capitalism, industrialism and spiritual background. As Büning and others pointed out, the staging left a standard for productions of the Ring Cycle to follow. Gerhard R. Koch mentioned in his <b>obituary</b> that the unity of direction, scene and light was new for Bayreuth and suggested a critical view on capitalism heading towards fascism.|$|E
