5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> one's identity with it. Verses 10.6–15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

25|$|Another {{model that}} has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model {{explains}} that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that {{are present in the}} environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is not that one has sex because <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> sexual desire; rather, the case is that <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> sexual desire because one has sex.|$|E
25|$|The mind is everything. It is in {{the mind}} alone that <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> pure and impure. A man, first of all, must make his own mind guilty and then alone can he see another man's guilt.|$|E

25|$|Emotions {{contribute}} to negotiation processes by signaling what <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> and thinks and can thus prevent {{the other party}} from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to examine this argument further, since <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> that some molecules, such as water, must have EDM irrespective of whether T is a symmetry. This is correct: if a quantum system has degenerate ground states that transform into each other under parity, then time reversal need not be broken to give EDM.|$|E
25|$|Somatic delusion: Delusion whose content {{pertains}} to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance. Usually the false {{belief is that}} the body is somehow diseased, abnormal or changed. A specific example of this delusion is delusional parasitosis: Delusion in which <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> infested with insects, bacteria, mites, spiders, lice, fleas, worms, or other organisms. Affected individuals may also report being repeatedly bitten. In some cases, entomologists are asked to investigate cases of mysterious bites. Sometimes physical manifestations may occur including skin lesions.|$|E

25|$|The Latin Rite of the Catholic Church {{does not}} teach that the {{suffering}} of purgatory is imposed by God. Among the many theologies that attempt to explain purgatory, one might maintain {{that it is the}} burning regret <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> when one's life is revealed in full after death, and the remorse that precedes putting this behind and passing on to the state of blessedness. Knowing the acts of love that those on earth are offering for one might conceivably make more bearable the remorse.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday neurosis. The term refers to a form of anxiety {{resulting}} from an awareness in some people of the emptiness of their lives once the working week is over. Some complain of a void and a vague discontent. This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and emptiness. <b>One</b> <b>feels</b> cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic neurosis).|$|E
25|$|Grief is {{a natural}} {{response}} to loss. It is the emotional suffering <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve {{in connection with a}} variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.|$|E

25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Day, Japanese {{people have}} a custom of giving money to children, known as otoshidama. It is handed out in small {{decorated}} envelopes called pochibukuro, similar to Shūgi-bukuro or Chinese hóngbāo and to the Scottish handsel. In the Edo period large stores and wealthy families gave out a small bag of mochi and a Mandarin orange to spread happiness all around. The amount of money given depends on {{the age of the}} child but is usually the same if {{there is more than one}} child so that no <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> slighted. It is not uncommon for amounts greater than ¥10,000 (US $83.16) to be given.|$|E
25|$|Following the September 11 attacks, several American mosques were {{targeted}} in attacks ranging from simple vandalism to arson. Furthermore, the Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting {{to bomb the}} King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the Hassan Bek Mosque {{was the target of}} vandalism and attacks by hundreds of Israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in Tel Aviv. Although mosquegoing is highly encouraged for men, it is permitted to stay at home when <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> at risk from Islamophobic persecution.|$|E

25|$|Toulouse-Lautrec {{would have}} seized at once {{on all that}} was {{significant}} of the moral atmosphere, would have seized most of all on what satisfied his slightly morbid relish of depravity... But Seurat, <b>one</b> <b>feels,</b> saw it almost as one might suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{kindness}} towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, {{but she has}} already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes {{to find out what}} has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no <b>one</b> <b>feels</b> truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!—"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!").|$|E
25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness <b>one</b> <b>feels,</b> and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
