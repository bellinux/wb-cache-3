5|$|By the 2005–06 season Wade had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most prominent players in the NBA and was elected to his second All-Star Game, this time a starter. In the 2006 All-Star Game, Wade made the game-winning put-back off of the Philadelphia 76ers' Allen Iverson's missed shot, to lead the East to a 122–120 victory <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> He scored 20 points on 9/11 field goals in 30 minutes of play. He finished the 2005–06 regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals per game.|$|E
5|$|Crossing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> {{branch of}} Cazenovia Creek, NY240 and CR30 {{continue}} north through Concord, bending northwest into an intersection with CR563 (Foote Road). The routes bend northward through the hamlet of Footes, paralleling {{the creek and}} railroad track before entering the town of Colden. In Colden, NY240 and CR30 become a two-lane residential street surrounded by dense woods in the nearby hills. After another bend to the northwest, the routes enter the hamlet of Glenwood. In Glenwood, NY240 intersects with the western terminus of CR240 (HollandGlenwood Road), which doubles as the northern terminus of CR30, as NY240 is state-maintained north of this junction.|$|E

5|$|Several windows {{maintain}} their original shape and size. The original stained-glass decorations were almost all {{lost in the}} 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation {{at the end of}} the 19th century, most of them by the Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasmåleri. The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity: God the Father <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> door, God the Son above the south door (the largest in the church), and God the Holy Spirit above the north door. Crafted in limestone, the rose window at the north portal is the oldest, unchanged since the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Cuthbert (which {{tourists}} often {{mistake for}} the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone tower and a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), {{it was much}} altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> door.

5|$|Water {{services}} used to {{be provided}} by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, which served 30% of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains, septic tanks, or open canals. MWSS was privatized in 1997, which split the water concession into {{the east and west}} zones. The Maynilad Water Services took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> zone of which Manila is a part. It now provides the supply and delivery of potable water and sewerage system in Manila, but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water.

Further east, the highway crosses Hogg's Hollow, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Don River and Yonge Street in the centre of Toronto, the busiest multi-span bridge crossing in North America, surpassing the Brooklyn Bridge. It then crosses the East Don River and climbs toward the Don Valley Parkway, which provides access to downtown Toronto and Highway404, which provides access to the suburbs to the north. Progressing eastward, the highway continues through mostly residential areas in Scarborough, eventually reaching the Rouge Valley on the city's eastern edge and crossing into Pickering.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary was {{selected}} for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009.

She then made 13 in the team's warm-up match on English soil, against the hosts, but was nevertheless retained for all the matches. She made a duck as Australia lost their opening match against New Zealand, and was not required to bat in the win <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies. Ebsary made 23 run out in the final group match as Australia defeated South Africa to reach the semi-finals.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{about three-quarters}} of the Oroville-Chico Highway was absorbed by other routes. A new two-lane {{alignment}} of U.S. Route 99E (Legislative Route 3, now SR 99) between east of Richvale and Chico opened in the mid-1950s, using part of the Oroville-Chico Highway south of Durham Dayton Highway and bypassing the remainder to the junction south of Chico. In the early 1960s, U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Legislative Route 21, now SR 70) was relocated due to the damming of Lake Oroville across its old alignment. The bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Branch Feather River northwest of the dam opened in August 1962, resulting in US 40 Alt. using the Oroville-Chico Highway (which was relocated to a new four-lane freeway alignment) south of Wicks Corner. The remainder, which was never part of a sign route, became Route 149 in the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|On November20, {{shortly before}} the {{tropical}} depression intensified into a tropical storm, the government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for the Swan Islands, along with a tropical storm watch for the northwestern Honduran coastline. The advisories were discontinued within 10hours of Keith's passage through the region. The government of Belize briefly declared a tropical storm watch for the whole coastline of the country, but {{when it became clear}} that Keith posed little threat, the watch was canceled. About 16hours before the storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for much of the coastline of Quintana Roo. Six hours later, a tropical storm warning replaced the watch, and it was extended west to Progreso, Yucatán; a hurricane watch was also posted. Cuban officials issued a bulletin on the night of November20, advising that tropical storm conditions would spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> part of Cuba. A subsequent bulletin indicated the possibility for hurricane conditions, but as the storm continued further to the northwest, the threat diminished.|$|E
5|$|Stafford repaid the king's {{generosity}} {{by serving}} him faithfully {{as a local}} commissioner, {{in a part of}} the country that had up until that point been fiercely Lancastrian. Throughout the 1460s he presided at Quarter Sessions and other courts all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Country. His activities were not limited to legal commissions; in 1461–2 he performed military service against the Scots, and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with Brittany. In 1469 he was admitted to the Royal Council, and served on the commission that convicted Henry Courtenay, Thomas Courtenay's brother, for treason. According to the chronicler John Warkworth, Henry's downfall was due to the machinations of Stafford, who was rewarded with further land and the earldom of Devon on 17 May 1469. However, the king himself took great interest in the trial against Courtenay, and it is more reasonable to see the decision as a result of Edward's need for a loyal agent in the region.|$|E

5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers {{lived and worked}} in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E
5|$|The West Virginia Legislature {{has passed}} a series of laws in the West Virginia Code {{governing}} the usage of the West Virginia state flag. The state flag is not permitted to be placed above, or if on the same level, {{to the right of}} the United States flag. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E

5|$|When it was {{originally}} built, the Feather River Highway northeast from Oroville followed the present Oroville Dam Boulevard (County Route B2) to the present location of the Oroville Dam, and then ran north and northeast alongside the North Fork Feather River along a route now covered by Lake Oroville. It left to the north on Dark Canyon Road, meeting the present alignment at Jarbo Gap. Since the old road would be flooded, a $14.8 million new alignment, much of it four lanes, was built around the west side; the Western Pacific Railroad was also relocated to a nearby alignment. The double-decker West Branch Bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Branch Feather River northwest of the dam, carrying the highway above the rail line, was dedicated on August 15, 1962. Three portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to freeways: north of SR 99 to Berry and Kempton Roads in the early 2010s; south from Marysville to the State Route 65 split in the mid-1950s, extended farther south in the late 1960s and late 2000s; and around downtown Oroville, built in the early 1960s. In 2004, SR 70 was upgraded to a four-lane expressway between Feather River Boulevard north of the Bear River and the Yuba/Sutter county line to the freeway portion south of McGowan Parkway. A freeway interchange was constructed in 2008 at Plumas Lake Boulevard {{for access to the}} Plumas Lake development previously served at an uncontrolled intersection with Plumas Arboga Road. The removal of this intersection effectively upgraded the expressway portion to freeway south to the Feather River Boulevard intersection. In the early 2010s, the last two-lane segment of SR 70 south of Marysville was expanded to a four-lane expressway, with a freeway section bypassing the small town of East Nicolaus to the west. In 2015, the interchange with Feather River Boulevard in Plumas Lake was opened to traffic, eliminating the last signalized intersection between Sacramento (with SR 99) and Marysville.|$|E
