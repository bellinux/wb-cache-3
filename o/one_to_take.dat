5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the match 5–3.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in {{time for him to}} take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|By September 1767, all {{but four}} Jesuits {{had left the}} Chiquitania, and they went the {{following}} April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established {{a new system of}} government, very similar to that set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was that the Indians were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke ethical and religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.|$|E

5|$|Denis Compton hit a {{cautious}} 62, but Middlesex lost wickets regularly {{to fall from}} 1/78 to 203 all out. Five bowlers shared the wickets, Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece. At one stage, Australia were 53/3, but Morris (109) and Loxton (123) put on a partnership of 172. No other batsman bettered Hamence's 30, and Jim Sims took 6/65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46. Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings, with only John Dewes (51) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists, while eight managed only single figures. Five bowlers shared the wickets, and McCool was the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> three. McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{along the}} UTA TRAX network are open-air structures featuring passenger canopies {{for protection from}} adverse weather. Many of the canopies are designed to resemble the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building (which is located Downtown and listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Works of public art included at several stations were developed {{as part of the}} UTA's Art in Transit program. At first the program was met with skepticism; initially, only the stations constructed in Salt Lake City incorporated public art into their designs. This was the case as the city was initially the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the Art in Transit program. The program has since grown in popularity, and many of the stations constructed as part of the FrontLines 2015 expansion will include public art in their final design.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} driver {{in the history of}} Formula <b>One</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pole position, with a time of 1:37.555 in very wet conditions. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kovalainen. Mark Webber qualified third after his final lap pushed Sébastien Bourdais into fourthposition. Massa took sixthposition behind Rosberg. Trulli, Fernando Alonso, Glock and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Kubica qualified 11th, blaming late rain in the second qualifying session for his position. Fisichella qualified 12th to give Force India its best grid position of the season. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton blamed a late entry into the second session for their poor qualifying times, which saw them eliminated in 14th and 15th positions, respectively. Hamilton originally ran on the standard wet-weather tyres, {{and by the time he}} had changed to extreme wet-weather tyres the rain had intensified. This was McLaren's only result outside the top ten in qualifying all season and the first time in Hamilton's career that he had failed to progress into the final qualifying session.|$|E

5|$|Massa made a {{pit stop}} on lap53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He {{subsequently}} set the fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able {{to close the gap}} on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn <b>one,</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.|$|E

The incident was sparked when a magistrate and a representative of the New Zealand Company, who held a possibly fraudulent deed to land in the Wairau Valley in the north of the South Island, led a group of European settlers to attempt to clear Māori off the land and arrest Ngāti Toa chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata. Fighting broke out and 22 British settlers were killed, several after their surrender. Four Māori were killed, including the wife of Te Rangihaeata and the wife of Te Rauparaha.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} {{revealed}} why Diamante Azul was replaced {{in the fourth}} match of the night as Diamante Azul took the place of Místico La Nueva Era who had injured his shoulder in the week {{leading up to the}} show. Místico was on hand to announce that he would be unable to wrestle for approximately three weeks due to the injury. Azul teamed with Atlantis and La Sombra to fight against Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors";Euforia, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero). The match was another chapter in an ongoing storyline between Atlantis and Último Guerrero that stretched back to 2011 when Atlantis left Los Guerreros del Infierno, causing bad blood between himself and Guerrero. During the match Atlantis tried to tear Último Guerrero's mask off at several points of the match. Los Guerreros won the first fall, then lost the second <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the match to the full three falls.

25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E
