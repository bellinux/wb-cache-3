A passing [...] "charming man" [...] in a luxury car stops to offer the cyclist a lift, and although the protagonist is at first hesitant, after much deliberation he accepts the offer. While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: [...] "I would go <b>out</b> <b>tonight,</b> but I haven't got a stitch to wear".

Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came <b>out</b> <b>tonight</b> and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl."

She then {{moves to the}} hook of the song, [...] "I’ll take you <b>out</b> <b>tonight,</b> say whatever you like, scheiße be mine". Following the hook is a pre-chorus backed by syncopated synths, with influences of techno music. The chorus of the song, in which Gaga includes the word [...] "Scheiße", is backed by [...] "dueling screechy" [...] synths. It is broken up by Gaga repeatedly singing in-between lines [...] "oh oh oh oh oh" [...] in an electronically altered voice. The next verses, containing lyrics of Gaga being a strong woman, are all backed by [...] "growling, guttural" [...] synths, and are mixed with German and English. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Scheiße" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. It is composed on the key of C minor, with Gaga's voice spanning from F3 to C5. The song follows in the sequence of Cm–Cm/Cm–Eb/Gm as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|Hatton {{started the}} fight the {{stronger}} of the pair, {{but did not}} time his shots well. Senchenko used his superior reach to land jabs, and gained the upper hand as the fight progressed. In the ninth round, a left hook to the body sent Hatton to the floor. Knocked down {{by the type of}} punch previously viewed as his own signature, Hatton was counted out by the referee. It was the third time Hatton had been stopped, taking his overall record to 45 wins and 3 defeats.

[...] Backup catcher Mike Redmond coined the phrase, saying the hitters have to [...] "smell those RBIs" [...] {{when they see}} runners in scoring {{position}} in key situations. Hitters will tap their noses when they come through. After a 9-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers on September 8 that followed a two-week-long hitting drought, hitting coach Joe Vavra remarked: [...] "The 'smell 'ems' were <b>out</b> again <b>tonight.</b> That's the good feeling we were missing." ...|$|R

"It will be {{vastly more}} {{difficult}} then than now," [...] Captain Forster said; [...] "Bathurst {{made his way}} <b>out</b> <b>tonight</b> without difficulty, {{but they will be}} a great deal more vigilant when they know we cannot hold out much longer.
