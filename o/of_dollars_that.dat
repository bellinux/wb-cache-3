25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF that appeals to capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. They hope that the Fund will ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to build the}} first stage of the East West Link was criticised as a misuse of public funds that should have been spent on public transport. Fristacky said the project would deprive Melbourne of billions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> were needed for the construction of the Melbourne airport railway, Doncaster railway line, Rowville line, Melbourne Metro and the Mernda rail extension. Public Transport Users Association president Tony Morton said the project would not solve Melbourne traffic problems and that the 2013 state Budget should have focused on badly needed rail upgrades.|$|E

2500|$|In June, the Harris {{campaign}} {{received a}} legal bill for thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> contained {{a reference to}} [...] "DOJ subpoena". Later, an ex-aide told the Associated Press that Harris had received a grand jury subpoena from federal investigators, but kept it from her top advisers, prompting several staff members to quit when they found out. On June 8, 2006, Harris's fourth chief of staff, Fred Asbell, left in order to pursue a [...] "business opportunity". Asbell said he'd [...] "greatly enjoyed" [...] his time with the campaign and he would remain in a consultant position. On July 12, 2006, Harris's campaign spokesman Chris Christopher Ingram left the campaign. The next day he was followed by campaign manager Glenn Hodas, field director Pat Thomas, political director Brian Brooks and Deputy field director John K. Byers, who all resigned from her campaign. Hodas cited Harris's [...] "tantrums" [...] and [...] "increasingly erratic behavior" [...] as his reasons for leaving. An anonymous campaign worker described Harris as [...] "very difficult to work with. The more that we put her out there, the more she shot herself in the foot." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{father was}} unable to resist her tender violence; and though I could see he nourished not one spark of hope, he consented to desert his whole estate, beyond some {{hundreds}} <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> he had by him at the moment, and to flee that night, which promised to be dark and cloudy. As soon as the servants were asleep, he was to load two mules with provisions; two others were to carry my mother and myself; and, striking through the mountains by an unfrequented trail, we were to make a fair stroke for liberty and life. As soon as they had thus decided, I showed myself at the window, and, owning that I had heard all, assured them that they could rely on my prudence and devotion. I had no fear, indeed, but to show myself unworthy of my birth; I held my life in my hand without alarm; and when my father, weeping upon my neck, had blessed Heaven for the courage of his child, {{it was with a}} sentiment of pride and some of the joy that warriors take in war, that I began to look forward to the perils of our flight.|$|E
60|$|But these {{means of}} traffic and travel soon ceased to suffice. Then the Ohio people {{felt the need}} of getting out with their {{increasing}} crops, their multiplying flocks and herds, and they made their need known to the nation, {{to which they were}} everywhere akin, and the nation answered through Congress by beginning, in 1806, the National Road, which was finished by 1838, from Baltimore as far as Indiana. This road first opened the East to Ohio; then in 1811 a steamboat made its appearance on the Beautiful River, and after that steam commanded all the Southern and Southwestern waters for us, {{as well as those of}} the inland seas on the North. Then, that all these waters might be united, the state began in 1825 to build a system of canals, from Cleveland to Portsmouth and from Toledo to Cincinnati. When these canals were completed, with their branches, they gave the people some nine hundred miles of navigable waters within their own borders. The main lines were built, not by companies for private profit as the railroads have since been built, but by the people for the people, and it may be said that the great prosperity of Ohio began with them. Wherever they ran they drained the swamps and made the land not only habitable but beautiful. They were dug by Ohio people, and the sixteen millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> they cost came back into the hands of the men who gladly taxed themselves for the outlay. The towns along their course grew, and new towns rose out of the forests and prairies.|$|E
