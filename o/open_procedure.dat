25|$|To {{definitively}} diagnose ovarian cancer, {{a surgical}} procedure {{to inspect the}} abdomen is required. This can be an <b>open</b> <b>procedure</b> (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure {{can also be used}} to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).|$|E
25|$|A {{cholecystectomy}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which the}} gallbladder is removed. It may be removed because of recurrent gallstones, and is considered an elective procedure. A cholecystectomy may be an <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> or one conducted by laparoscopy. In the surgery, the gallbladder {{is removed from the}} neck to the fundus, and so bile will drain directly from the liver into the biliary tree. About 30 percent of patients may experience some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications are much rarer. About 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition of postcholecystectomy syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the recent}} past, small tears were treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> [...] Advances in {{arthroscopy}} now allow arthroscopic repair {{of even the}} largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. [...] The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although significant differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use apparently are not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgical patients.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} types of {{surgical}} procedure available {{for the treatment of}} VUR: endoscopic (STING/HIT procedures); laparoscopic; robotic-assisted laparoscopic; and <b>open</b> <b>procedures</b> (Cohen procedure, Leadbetter-Politano procedure, Lich-Gregoir technique). Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedures are often imitation of classical <b>open</b> <b>procedures</b> [...] in laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic environments.|$|R

2500|$|Two {{methods of}} {{promoting}} rotator cuff healing are injecting patients' own stem cells (or other growth factors) into {{the site of}} the repair, and installing scaffolds (natural or artificial supports that maintain tissue contour). The results of using PRP (platelet rich plasma) to augment the healing of rotator cuff repair at the time of surgery, although intellectually interesting, does not seem to demonstrate a statistically significant [...] clinical difference. [...] Biceps tenotomy and tendonesis are treatment alternatives for patients with rotator cuff tears as well as bicep tendon lesions. Tendonesis, which may be performed as an arthroscopic or <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> generally restores strength and function. Tenotomy is a shorter surgery, requiring less rehabilitation, that doctors tend to recommended for older patients.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Public {{procurement}} procedures provide a crucial {{function in the}} public sector and often involve making decisions of far-reaching effects.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the clinical outcomes of 102 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer at thehospital of Shiga University of Medical Science. We have performed laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer since 1998,and have performed laparoscopic D 2 or D 3 lymph node dissection for Stage I disease since 2006. We confirmed thatshort-term clinical outcomes {{and quantity of}} dissected lymph nodes in laparoscopic surgery were comparable to patientsundergoing <b>open</b> <b>procedures</b> for Stage I colorectal cancer.

50|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of SLAP tears {{has become more}} common in recent years. The success rate for repairing isolated SLAP tears is reported between 74-94%.

50|$|It {{was first}} {{performed}} by Ernest Heller (1877 - 1964) in 1913. Then and until recently, this surgery was performed using an <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> either through the chest (thoracotomy) {{or through the}} abdomen (laparotomy). However, open procedures involve greater recovery times. Modern Heller myotomy is normally performed using minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, which minimize risks and speeds recovery significantly.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted however that urethrotomy is a much simpler {{operation}} requiring much less recovery time and that open surgical excision of a simple, short stricture even if initially successful may still require the same repeated post operative self dilation that the simpler urethrotomy often requires. It may be that a longer complicated stricture may be better treated with an <b>open</b> <b>procedure</b> while the shorter simpler one with a urethrotomy.|$|E
30|$|Hips {{with mild}} and {{moderate}} SCFE generally had good functional and radiological outcome at a mean follow-up of 18 Â years, and for these hips {{there seems to}} be no indication for <b>open</b> <b>procedures.</b> However, severe slips have a significantly worse outcome, and open reduction and internal fixation could therefore be considered.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{magnitude}} of the systemic response {{is proportional to the}} degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and <b>open</b> <b>procedures.</b> In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with <b>open</b> <b>procedures,</b> resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or <b>open</b> <b>procedures</b> on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{advantages}} to the patient with laparoscopic surgery versus the more common, <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Pain and hemorrhaging are reduced due to smaller incisions and recovery times are shorter. The key element in laparoscopic surgery is the use of a laparoscope, a long fiber optic cable system which allows viewing of the affected area by snaking the cable from a more distant, but more easily accessible location.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{case study}} from 2013, they {{compared}} the open vs endoscopic techniques for 162 other studies that contained 5,701 patients. [...] They only looked at four tumor types: the olfactory groove meningiomas (OGM), tuberculum sellae meningiomas(TSM), craniopharyngiomas (CRA), and clival chordomas (CHO). They looked at gross total resection and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, neurological death, post-operative visual function, post operative diabetes insipidus, and post-operative obesity. The study showed {{that there was a}} greater chance of CSF leaks with endoscopic endonasal surgery. The visual function improved more with endoscopic surgery for TSM, CRA, and CHO patients. Diabetes insipidus occurred more in <b>open</b> <b>procedure</b> patients. The endoscopic patients showed a higher recurrence rate. In another case study on CRAs, they showed similar results with the CSF leaks being more of a problem in endoscopic patients. <b>Open</b> <b>procedure</b> patients showed a higher rate of post operative seizures as well. Both of these studies still suggest that despite the CSF leaks, that the endoscopic technique is still an appropriate and suitable surgical option. Otologic surgery, which is traditionally performed via an open approach using a microscope, may also be performed endoscopically, and is called Endoscopic Ear Surgery or EES.|$|E

50|$|Though a {{very common}} procedure, the {{experience}} level of the surgeon performing the operation {{is very important in}} determining the outcomes, rate of complications and side effects.

50|$|Males {{tend to have}} larger, longer, {{and wider}} noses than females, and {{the tip of the}} female nose will often visibly point {{slightly}} upwards when compared to a male, so the procedure involves removing bone, cartilage and remodelling what remains. In most cases this is performed in an <b>open</b> <b>procedure,</b> but endonasal procedures have been used; in all cases when reducing the nose there is a risk of interfering with nasal valve function. Standard rhinoplasty procedures are generally used. There is limited data on outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there have}} been {{reported}} cases of patients who were given medical treatment and survived, primary drainage of the abscess is the main treatment used to cure this condition. Drainage usually involves a surgical procedure. It {{has been shown that}} CT-guided drainage brought inferior results than open drainage. Hence, open surgical procedure is preferred to successfully remove the abscess. However, CT-guided drainage is the option treatment for patients who may not tolerate an <b>open</b> <b>procedure.</b> Endoscopic treatment {{is at the same time}} a treatment option that increased in popularity over the last years.|$|E
50|$|The Heller myotomy is a {{long-term}} treatment, and many patients do not require any further treatment. However, some will eventually need pneumatic dilation, repeat myotomy (usually performed as an <b>open</b> <b>procedure</b> the second time around), or oesophagectomy. It is important to monitor changes in the shape and function of the esophagus with an annual timed barium swallow. Regular endoscopy may also be useful to monitor changes in the tissue of the oesophagus, since reflux may damage the oesophagus over time, potentially causing the return of dysphagia, or a premalignant condition known as Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
