5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> children over four years of age.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E

5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the monument. Included {{among the more}} than 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|E
5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the scrapyard also died.|$|E

5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as they are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5000|$|St. Mary's {{dominated}} the final and the scoreline, 2-0 {{did not reflect}} their superiority. This led to criticism in the Bournemouth Guardian that [...] "with forwards equal to the defence, St. Mary's might play a good game with better clubs than we <b>often</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Hampshire; though I still have my doubts about Aston Villa".|$|R

5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|Over the Hedge is {{presented}} in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the touch screen shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{performed}} in {{public for the}} first time in four years in 2004, appearing with an octet at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. He was not <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> public after this. In 2005, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded him its President's Merit Award. In 2006, Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver, was published by the University of California Press. A 2008 release, Live at Newport '58, from a Silver concert fifty years earlier, reached the top ten of Billboards jazz chart.|$|E

5|$|Species {{lists for}} the park include about 50 mammals, 86 birds, 11 {{reptiles}} and amphibians, 8 bats, more than 200 arthropods, 8 snails and slugs, 75 butterflies, more than 55 moths, and 8 aquatic macroinvertebrates. Of these species, 160 are found inside the cave. Outside the cave, the black-tailed deer, Steller's jay, the common raven, and Townsend's chipmunk are among animals <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the park. Less commonly sighted are the black bear, cougar, northern flying squirrel, and Pacific giant salamander. Springs and other wet places support flatworms, frogs, and snails.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
50|$|The {{aggressive}} “Hispanic gangbanger/criminal” stereotype, {{which we}} <b>often</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> movies and on television, is inaccurate. Gang-suppression approaches of numerous police departments have become “over-inclusive and embedded with practices that create opportunities for abuse of authority.” This means {{most of the}} gang enforcement police stops are based on racial profiling. These stops involve no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and oftentimes include non-gang members.|$|R

5|$|The, Tennessee Walking Horse or Tennessee Walker is a {{breed of}} gaited horse {{known for its}} unique four-beat running-walk and flashy movement. It was {{originally}} developed in the southern United States for use on farms and plantations. It is a popular riding horse due to its calm disposition, smooth gaits and sure-footedness. The Tennessee Walking Horse is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the show ring, but is also popular as a pleasure and trail riding horse using both English and Western equipment. Tennessee Walkers are also seen in movies, television shows and other performances.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E
