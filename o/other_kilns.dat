The industry declined during the 20th century as the products of the London Brick Company were more uniform than those produced in Bridgwater, and the increasing use of concrete after World War II. The kiln was last fired in 1965, the year that the works closed.

50|$|The {{presence}} of the dockyard, the arsenal and other military institutions stimulated economic growth in other areas, notably in commercial activities and entertainment. The ropeyard was established around 1570 and survived until 1832. Throughout the 17th century two glass factories were active near Glass Yard, owned by Sir Robert Mansell from Greenwich, who also managed the dockyard and the ropeyard. Some of the masters here were Huguenots from Lorraine.

5000|$|The {{top of the}} kilns {{was flat}} and large enough to allow for some storage of culm and limestone. Like Lord Rolle's kilns at Rosemore, Great Torrington and his nearby Town Mills they were at a late date crenellated with castle-like battlements, an {{eccentric}} decorative feature probably added by John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (d.1842), of Stevenstone, lord of the manor of Great Torrington, builder of the Rolle Canal and partner {{in the building of}} Half-Penny Bridge with Mr Tardrew of Annery. Town Mills were crenellated to form an [...] "eye-catcher" [...] when viewed up the picturesque Torridge valley from Castle Hill, Great Torrington, which Lord Rolle had also castellated to recall the ancient castle. The original Annery kiln had been built prior to Lord Rolles's canal and the Great Torrington lime kilns; it is unlikely to have had the crenellations.Annery was well built, with local mortar-cemented stones, a rubble infill and firebricks lining the kilns' combustion chambers.

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of cement, lime and magnesium oxide covers the following specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: • 3. 1. Production of cement, lime and magnesium oxide: (a) 	production of cement clinker in rotary kilns with a production capacity exceeding 500 tonnes per day or in <b>other</b> <b>kilns</b> with a production capacity exceeding 50 tonnes per day; (b) 	production of lime in kilns with a production capacity exceeding 50 tonnes per day; (c) 	production of magnesium oxide in kilns with a production capacity exceeding 50 tonnes per day. The document also covers some activities that may be directly associated to these activities on the same site. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the production of cement, lime and magnesium oxide are the reduction of emissions to air; efficient energy and raw material usage; minimisation, recovery and the recycling of process residues; as well as effective environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains 4 main chapters: Chapter 1 – Cement Industry, Chapter 2 – Lime Industry and Chapter 3 – Magnesium Oxide Industry (dry process route based on mined natural magnesite). Sections 1 and 2 of Chapters 1 – 3 provide general information on the industrial sector concerned and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Sections 3 of Chapters 1 – 3 provide data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations within the sector. Sections 4 of Chapters 1 – 3 describe the techniques to prevent or, where this is not practicable, to reduce the environmental impact of installations in this sector that were considered in determining the BAT. Sections 5 of Chapters 1 – 3 present information on 'emerging techniques' as defined in Article 3 (14) of the Directive.

40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} {{commonly used}} in industry to achieve {{a wide array of}} material processing operations. Rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of uranium fluoride into uranium dioxide for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, they consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or exit dam at the kiln outlet end. They usually require very little labor to operate. Though operational cost of these units is usually high, their design is often conservative {{due to the lack of}} fundamental physical understanding of both solids flow and heat transfer. The objective of this presentation is to provide a new model to predict the residence time of solid particles within the rotary kiln based on a dimensional analysis. This model can be used for process control as well as for design purposes. Progress of material through a rotary kiln is affected by a number of factors, namely: length and diameter of the kiln, design and number of lifters distributed around the circumference, rotational speed, and slope of the kiln, exit dam height at the kiln outlet end, flow rate and physical properties of the material. Experiments were carried out on a pilot scale rotary kiln at room temperature, whether or not equipped with lifters or fitted with dam at the outlet end. These experiments aimed at determining the effects of most of the factors listed above on the mean residence time of solid particles; the mean residence time was determined from residence time distribution measurements data. The tracer impulse-response technique was used to establish residence time distribution curves. Two granular solids having different properties were used: sand and broken rice. Furthermore, two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifter geometry: straight lifters (SL) and rectangular lifters (RL). The other operational parameters were also varied so that a matrix of 69 experiments (without including repeatability tests) was achieved. These experiments were used for the consolidation and validation of the presented model. The model not only gave good agreement with the experimental data from the present study, but also demonstrated good predictive performances when applied to published experimental data of <b>other</b> <b>kilns,</b> having different design, materials, and order of magnitude of the operating parameters. The excellent predictive capacity of the model compared to other semi-empirical models shows its capacity to handle a wide range of conditions and operating variables. The model is applicable for inclined kilns that process materials in cascading (tumbling) motion, whether or not equipped with lifters or fitted with dams at the outlet end...|$|E
