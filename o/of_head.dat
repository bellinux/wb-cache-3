5|$|The scaly {{juvenile}} plumage is retained until January or February of {{the year}} following hatching, when a lengthy moult <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly <b>of</b> <b>head,</b> body and tail feathers.|$|E

5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause <b>of</b> <b>head</b> injury.

In the US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E
