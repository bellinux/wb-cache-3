5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E

A horrified Smithers finally stands up to Mr. Burns, insisting that he has gone too far; Mr. Burns fires him in response.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} the Solar System began 4.6billion {{years ago with the}} gravitational collapse of a small part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, Warhol {{established}} the record auction {{price for a}} painting by a living American artist with a $60,000 sale of Big Campbell's Soup Can with Torn Label (Vegetable Beef) (1962) in a sale at Parke-Bernet, the preeminent American auction house of the day (later acquired by Sotheby's). This record was broken {{a few months later}} by his rival for the artworld's attention and approval, Lichtenstein, who sold a depiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> brush stroke, Big Painting No. 6 (1965) for $75,000.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 {{was in the early}} 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E

5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> or supergiant star which {{is known as the}} triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Having grown {{attached}} to Tawna during {{their time in}} captivity, Crash resolves to rescue her and defeat Cortex. From the beach of N.

Crash then enters the hut of tribe leader Papu Papu and is forced to defeat him in self-defense after inadvertently waking him from his nap. Riding {{on the back of a}} wild hog, Crash escapes the pursuing villagers and climbs over the opposite fortress wall.|$|E

5000|$|The legendary Bevis of Hampton is in Sussex {{folklore}} <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> {{often associated}} with Arundel, where {{he was supposed to}} live and would sometimes stride across the sea to the Isle of Wight.

Another giant was Gill, after whom Gill's Grave on Mount Caburn was named. There is also a Gill's Ridge near Crowborough and Gill's Lap in Ashdown Forest.|$|R
5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for statehood. A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the demons}} learn <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> {{structure}} {{on one of}} the moons orbiting the planet, Malduke, that was designed to be a space station for residential and military purposes, possessing a powerful weapon that could destroy Filgaia. Inside the demons' newly-arisen tower Ka Dingel that connects with Malduke, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia confront what remains of their adversaries before reaching the teleportation device to take them to Malduke. Within Malduke's deepest sanctum, they confront Zeikfried, who transforms into a revived Mother. This new being, Motherfried, confronts the heroes with the intent of using Malduke's primary weapon to destroy Filgaia, but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Giant</b> Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems poised to attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides {{it away from the}} village.|$|E

5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from the collapse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> molecular cloud {{of gas and}} dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
