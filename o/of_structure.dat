40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the types of imperative sentences on the medicine brochure andto describe the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentences on the medicine brochure. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive qualitative. The writer uses medicine brochures as the data source. The method of collecting data is documentation with the techniques of reading, identifying, and classifying the data. In analyzing the data, the writer identifies the types of imperative sentences using theory <b>of</b> grammatical <b>structure</b> from Quirk (1983) and describes the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence using Chinese boxes from Francis (1958). The result of this study shows that (1) imperative sentence on the medicine brochure can be divided into two types: imperative sentence without a subject and negative imperative sentence, (2) there are six types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence in the medicine brochure: syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination, and syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{processes}} in different materials, structural components and natural objects are often occured by formation and transformation of ordered systems of cracks or cracklike faults (<b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture). Scale interaction {{can lead to}} formation of a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture of different length scales. Ordered systems of cracks or cracklike faults are observed, e. g., at fracture of ceramics and rocks under biaxial compression, pipeline steels and titanium under the hydrogen absorption, ice cover under the wind action. In the paper an approach is developed for modeling of processes of formation of hierarchical systems <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture. The approach implies, first, an analysis of a sequence of events leading to formation of separate elements <b>of</b> a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture of a certain scale (rank) taking into account local perturbations of the stress-deformation field caused by an influence <b>of</b> the initial <b>structure</b> and/or texture <b>of</b> the object under consideration. Then a set of such elements forms a basic element <b>of</b> a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture. In turn, a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture of a given scale {{can serve as a}} basic element for formation <b>of</b> a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture of another scale. The approach enables to take into account specific mechanisms of fracture and analyze formation <b>of</b> hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture. <b>Structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture of long-range action and short-range action are considered. Coupled <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture forming at smaller and larger scales relative to the scale <b>of</b> a basic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> fracture are analyzed. The results of modeling different types <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> fracture correlate with the available experimental data...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} trying to analyze the types <b>of</b> {{syntactic}} <b>structures</b> on the lyrics of "Rage Against The Machine", particularly on its structural patterns. The writer {{is trying to}} find out what types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> are found and the most predominant type <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> in the six rap songs of "Rage Against The Machine". The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze the six rap songs of "Rage Against The Machine". To be able to analyze the rap songs, he applies the basic four types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> based on Francis's theory as the major theory supported by Saymour Chatman on inversion. The four types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures,</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination, are found in the six rap songs. There is not any inversion of word order applied in rap songs, except in the two lines of 'Take the power back', line 11 and 37. The writer also finds there are similarities between the lyrics and the poem in form and <b>structure.</b> Both <b>of</b> them have verses and the lines constitute a structural relation between/among the lines. Structurally related lines of "Rage Against the Machine" construct three types of bigger construction <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures,</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination. Finally he finds that <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication is the most predominant type of all that reaches more than 50 %, followed by <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation, and the least predominant is <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination...|$|R

40|$|Structured text is {{a general}} concept that is {{implicit}} {{in a variety of}} approaches to handling information. Syntactically, an item <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text is a number of grammatically simple phrases together with a semantic label for each phrase. Items <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text may be nested within larger items <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to parameterize a stereotypical situation, and so a particular item <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text is an instance of that stereotypical situation. Much information is potentially available as structured text including tagged text in XML, text in relational and object-oriented databases, and the output from information extraction systems in the form of instantiated templates. In this paper, we formalize the concept <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text, and then focus on how we can identify inconsistency in the logical representation <b>of</b> items <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text.
