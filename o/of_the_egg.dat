5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics. Early {{divisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> are holoblastic (the cells divide completely) and radial (they gradually form a stack of circles). The process is regulative (the fate of each cell depends on interaction with other cells, not on a rigid program in each cell), and experiments that divided early embryos produced complete larvae. Mesoderm is formed from mesenchyme originating from the archenteron.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
5|$|In hatching, mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with an egg tooth and {{are born with}} fully {{developed}} venom glands; capable of inflicting a potentially lethal bite minutes after hatching. The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> yolk, and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E

40|$|In our {{previous}} {{report by the}} collaboration with YAJIMA and others (1959), it was described that the stool examinations by means of flotation technique alone for <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> 10 communities in <b>the</b> destrict <b>of</b> Chiba Prefecture in Japan has leaded <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> an unknown kind of eggs which resembled strictly <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> human parasitic nematodes, especially those of Hook-worms or Trichostrongylus orientalis, and which were detected in as high as several percent <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> subjects examined. From the aspect that <b>the</b> morphological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called unknown <b>eggs</b> resemble <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> phytoparasitic Meloidogyne spp., the present paper dealed with isolation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> Meloidogyne hapla from pea-nut roots, which were easily available, together with morphological observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> as well as measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size theirof. These observations were followed by examinations on <b>the</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> towards <b>the</b> treatment with either experimental heat or artificial gastric juice, {{as well as by}} observations on <b>the</b> morphological changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and <b>the</b> occurence theirof in stools following oral administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> in cats. <b>The</b> results indicated that, in case that <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> Meloidogyne spp. were ingested with diets and other materials into the human body, it is probably possible that <b>the</b> ingested <b>eggs</b> may be excreted into the stools without being distructed nor digested. The differentiation is very much difficult between <b>the</b> metamorphological <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> Meloidogyne hapla, obtained by <b>the</b> experimental administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> into cats, and <b>the</b> so-called unknown <b>eggs</b> <b>of</b> nematodes in human stools, therefore, it might be suggested that both kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are same each other...|$|R

5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} in {{the earliest}} divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> {{appears to be the}} original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, {{in the earliest}} Ecdysozoa and possibly in the earliest Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage does not imply that brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape and}} size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits {{as a result of}} enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E
5|$|The top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle {{through which the}} egg is fertilised. The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle {{is located on the}} outer margin or rim.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case}} of Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E

5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards {{the site for the}} two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E

When the evil King Galbatorix finds out the general location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> he sends the Ra'zac to acquire it. By that time Saphira had been growing for a while and takes Eragon to the Spine after Ra'zac appear in their village Carvahall.

The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths {{has led to}} the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted on a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.|$|E

5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of four to five years. The birds are colonial nesters, {{excavating}} burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and may also nest in crevices and amongst rocks and scree on occasion. It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.|$|E
