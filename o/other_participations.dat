40|$|Classical {{security}} protocols aim {{to achieve}} authentication and confidentiality {{under the assumption}} that the peers behave honestly. Some recent protocols are required to achieve their goals even if the peer misbehaves. Accountability is a protocol design strategy that may help. It delivers to the peers sufficient evidence of each <b>other’s</b> <b>participation</b> in the protocol. Accountability underlies the non-repudiation protocol of Zhou and Gollmann and the certified e-mail protocol of Abadi et al. This paper provides a comparative, formal analysis of the two protocols, and confirms that they reach their goals under realistic conditions. The treatment, which is conducted with mechanized support from the proof assistant Isabelle, requires various extensions to the existing analysis method. A byproduct is an account of the concept of higher-level protocol...|$|R
5000|$|Shirky {{asserts that}} {{collaborative}} crowdsourced work results from [...] "a successful fusion of a plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain with the users." [...] He {{states that the}} promise of what the user {{will get out of}} participating in a project leads to a person's desire to get involved. Collaborators will then choose the best social networking tool to do the job. One that [...] "must be designed to fit the job being done, and it must help people do something they actually want to do." [...] The bargain, Shirky states, defines what collaborators expect from each <b>other's</b> <b>participation</b> in the project. [...] Shirky's 'Promise, Tool, Bargain' premise restates aspects of the Uses and Gratifications Theory of mass media research.|$|R
