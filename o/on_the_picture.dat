5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|While working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> book, Luna {{realized}} he missed {{telling a story}} panel by panel and {{decided to return to}} comics. He and his brother had decided to work on separate projects, so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who {{falls in love with a}} female android to Vaughn over dinner. Vaughn, who began writing and drawing romance comics in her youth, jumped at the opportunity.|$|E

Documentary film-maker Barbara Kopple, commissioned {{to create a}} centennial history of the United Mine Workers, was there filming the strike and employed Green as a consultant. The film became Out of Darkness: The Mine Workers' Story. He received an associate producer credit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 3 April 1961, Vladimir Surin, the {{director-general}} of the Mosfilm studios, sent Furtseva {{a letter}} requesting {{to approve the}} adaptation of a script for a film in three parts based on War and Peace, {{as well as to}} allocate 150,000 Soviet ruble in funds. On 5 May the Minister replied, authorizing to begin writing the scenario and granting R30,000. On that day, the work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> began.|$|E
25|$|In April, it was {{announced}} that two cameramen from the Pathe' newsreel group were being brought in to consult on the film, still tentatively titled, News Reel.

25|$|The {{next step}} for Irwin was to {{determine}} if transsaccadic memory is tied to spatial position. He performed experiments using dot patterns and later, performed the same type of experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental condition were given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Unlike Irwin’s first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All shift down, target object shift down, or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. This demonstrated the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements.|$|E
25|$|Philip of Burgundy ordered Gossaert {{to execute}} a replica for the church of Middelburg, and the value which was then set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is {{apparent}} {{from the fact that}} Dürer came expressly to Middelburg (1521) to see it. In 1568 the altarpiece perished by fire. In 1508 Gossaert accompanied Philip of Burgundy on his Italian mission to the pope, and by this accident an important revolution was effected in the art of the Netherlands. Gossaert appears to have chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms on their own stock, and the cross turned out so unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality.|$|E
25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk got even dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or maybe because of it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not wearing jeans or even underpants <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E

Todd McCarthy wrote of Hoffman's performance: [...] "Decked out with a pouffy '80s hairdo, moustache, protruding gut and ever-present smokes... whenever he's <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> vibrates with conspiratorial electricity." [...] The film was a critical and commercial success, and along with his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Hoffman {{was nominated for a}} BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award.|$|E
500|$|Pitt had {{two major}} film roles in 2004, {{starring}} as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He {{spent six months}} sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad. An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> for several weeks. Stephen Hunter of The Washington Times stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role. Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures. Ocean's Twelve earned $362million worldwide, and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as [...] "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford." ...|$|E

500|$|Daniels was {{especially}} {{proud of the}} wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible {{through the window and}} was difficult to light properly. Greed has often been praised for its use of deep-focus cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in Citizen Kane. Daniels sometimes used incandescent lights instead of studio arc lights, due to the constraints of his locations. He later said that Stroheim [...] "was {{one of the first to}} insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown" [...] to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints. Although not officially credited, Ernest B. Schoedsack worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> as a camera operator.|$|E
500|$|The picture's {{significance}} {{has been}} the subject of broad speculation. Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene [...] "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself– [...] in a sense– [...] inside the picture.|$|E
500|$|One of Cronjager's first efforts {{behind the}} lens {{was at the}} age of 19, filming the heavyweight {{championship}} bout between Jack Dempsey and Luis Ángel Firpo in 1923. He began his career in the film industry in 1925 with the Famous Players-Lasky film corporation (later Paramount Pictures), where he remained until 1930. [...] His first project was the silent film, Womanhandled, starring Richard Dix, which would be shot at Lasky's Long Island, New York studio, where Cronjager worked until being transferred to Lasky's west coast operation in 1927. [...] The Film Daily called his work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> [...] "very good". During the next four years he photographed fifteen silent films, of which twelve starred Dix, and he shot almost every one of the twenty-nine pictures Dix made between 1927 and 1933. In addition, in 1927 Cronjager joined the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC).|$|E
