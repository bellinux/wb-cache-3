40|$|Scholars' {{criticism}} of transparency in public-private partnerships (PPPs) often focuses on ‘external’ transparency, that is, {{the extent to}} which internal information is visible to the outside world. However, to achieve external transparency, internal transparency - the availability and inferability of information for the public procurer and the private party - is crucial. In this article we analyse input, process, and output transparency from three different perspectives (institutional, cognitive, and strategic) in four PPPs in the Netherlands. We conclude that[*]input transparency is high, but process and output transparency less so. Moreover, output transparency has gained importance in PPPs. Whether this is problematic depends on the PPPs' institutional environment. In some partnerships the desired output is uncontested and predetermined by clear standards in the institutional environment, whereas <b>other</b> <b>PPPs</b> deal with contested output norms, decreasing the partnerships' transparency. These results nuance the current debate on the lack of transparency in PPPs...|$|R

Literature indicates that characteristics specific to PPPs contribute to these critical problems becoming dysfunctional conflicts. Consequently, objectives are no longer met and projects suffer. This study identified interventions that prevent these dysfunctional conflicts. In the literature, no interventions at an operational level that are suitable for use ‘at the negotiating table’ and are also applicable for urban development PPP projects were found.

Elimination of NAD-dependent {{glycerol}} 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) that has two homologous genes, GPD 1 and GPD 2, which are involved in glycerol metabolism by S. cerevisiae (Eriksson et al. 1995), increased ethanol yield while decreasing glycerol production (Björkqvist et al. 1997; Henningsen et al. 2015). In a preliminary examination, we verified that SS 118 (XI gpd 2 Δ) exhibited decreased glycerol production and improved ethanol production (Seike et al. unpublished observations).

40|$|Thesis (MPA (School of Public Management and Planning)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This study {{examines}} the key success {{factors in the}} Public Private Partnerships (PPP) field in the Healthcare Sector in South Africa. It gives health departments insight into the factors which should be considered when using PPP procurement and when looking at possible PPP opportunities. The development of PPP’s around the world has urged governments to look at alternative service delivery methods because of increased pressures on government budgets. Public Private Partnerships presents governments with a means of generating private funds for health service delivery whilst government manages the relationship via a negotiated PPP agreement to monitor the quality of services rendered. Different PPP models are applied {{all over the world}} depending on the specific needs of countries. Different factors impact on the success of these partnerships and it is essential that government share knowledge and best practices. The study showed that in order for PPP’s to be successful the public institution must do its homework thoroughly and that the legal framework should be conducive for private sector involvement in service delivery. The study showed that the government of a country plays a pivotal role in the PPP process by giving the necessary political support to ensure the trust of foreign investors. The legislative framework is a critical factor in the advancement of PPP procurement and the allocation of risk as an important consideration when pursuing this type of procurement. The study examined three concluded PPP Health Sector agreements in South Africa and looked at lessons learnt, mistakes which were made and what should be avoided in the future. The three PPP’s in South Africa in this study were the first though there are <b>other</b> health sector <b>PPP</b> agreements concluded. The <b>other</b> <b>PPP’s</b> are still in the commencement stage and {{it is too early to}} make an assessment at this stage. However, the three case studies conducted give departments a clear picture of the process, the lessons learnt and the impediments in the PPP process. The uniqueness of the South African Health sector also prompted the Government to look at a model which will be best suited to the local market. Best practices from other countries provide useful information and lessons learnt from other countries are also important in a developing PPP environment...|$|R

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} and up-to-date review of public private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects at the municipal level in Germany. Public private partnerships use the know-how and {{the skills of the}} private sector for the construction and operation of infrastructure and for the long-term provision of public services. The overall goal of this thesis is to discuss the municipal government's approach to PPP infrastructure projects. The theoretical part of this thesis includes informations and fundamental characteristics of public private partnership project types and the most widely used financial instruments in Germany, as well as the obstacles, challenges and prospects of success for the PPP Programme. The thesis further deals with the legislation and the institutional framework of this cooperation, including the establishment of the Partnerschaften Deutschland und <b>other</b> <b>PPP</b> units in central and local government to promote and manage projects.

40|$|In Australia, Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a {{relatively}} new concept to project finance. While {{there have been many}} successful infrastructure projects undertaken through PPPs, there are <b>other</b> <b>PPP</b> projects that have been fraught with problems. PPPs such as the Spencer Street Railway Station redevelopment in Melbourne and the Cross City Tunnel in Sydney renewed debate among professionals and academics on both the merits and the future direction of PPPs. PPPs in project finance bring together two disparate organisations with distinctly different goals as project sponsors. Such an arrangement requires the project sponsors to constantly strive to achieve common goals. Therefore, the success of PPPs depends upon, inter alia, the process of goal setting and negotiation by the project sponsors to meet their respective goals and to achieve the best possible performance outcome. Works describing the structuring of project finance {{and the use of the}} PPPs are increasingly common (Esty and Christov, 2002, Esty, 2003, Finnerty, 1996, Nevitt and Fabozzi, 2000, Yescombe, 2002). Nonetheless, the authors have not located any works focusing on the goal setting and negotiation issues in PPPs. This paper takes a first step towards addressing this deficiency by presenting a model for goal setting and negotiation in PPPs. This is followed by a review of the literature in each of the key areas of the model that influences goal setting and negotiation in PPPs: strategic factors in project finance, public sector goals and private sector goals. It concludes with the identification of the key research questions emanating from the model...|$|E
30|$|The pentose {{phosphate}} pathway (PPP) {{plays an}} important role in the synthesis of ribonucleotides and aromatic amino acids. During bioethanol production from cellulosic biomass composed mainly of d-glucose and d-xylose, the PPP is also involved in xylose metabolism by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the activities and thermostabilities of the four PPP enzymes (transaldolase: TAL 1, transketolase: TKL 1, ribose- 5 -phosphate ketol-isomerase: RKI 1 and d-ribulose- 5 -phosphate 3 -epimerase: RPE 1) can affect the efficiency of cellulosic ethanol production at high temperatures, little is known about the suitable expression levels of these PPP genes. Here, we overexpressed PPP genes from S. cerevisiae and the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus either singly or in combination in recombinant yeast strains harboring a mutant of xylose isomerase (XI) and evaluated xylose consumption and ethanol production of these yeast transformants in glucose/xylose mixed media at 36  °C. Among the PPP genes examined, we found that: (1) strains that overexpressed S. cerevisiae TKL 1 exhibited the highest rate of xylose consumption relative to strains that overexpressed <b>other</b> <b>PPP</b> genes alone; (2) overexpression of RKI 1 and TAL 1 derived from K. marxianus with S. cerevisiae TKL 1 increased the xylose consumption rate by 1.87 -fold at 24  h relative to the control strain (from 0.55 to 1.03  g/L/h); (3) the strains with XI showed higher ethanol yield than strains with xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase and (4) PHO 13 disruption did not improve xylose assimilation under the experimental conditions. Together these results indicated that optimization of PPP activity improves xylose metabolism in genetically engineered yeast strains, which could be useful for commercial production of ethanol from cellulosic material.|$|E

40|$|PPP 1 CC 2, {{one of four}} isoforms of the ser/thr protein {{phosphatase}} PP 1, is a mammalian-specific splice {{variant of}} the Ppp 1 cc gene, and the only isoform whose expression is confined almost completely to spermatogenic cells. Additionally, PPP 1 CC 2 is the sole isoform found in mammalian spermatozoa. Although PPP 1 CC 1, the <b>other</b> <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc product, is expressed in many tissues including testis, the only phenotype resulting from deletion of Ppp 1 cc gene is male infertility. To determine which of the products of Ppp 1 cc is essential for male fertility, we created two PPP 1 CC 2 transgenes, eTg-G 2 and pTg-G 2, where Ppp 1 cc 2 expression was driven by the putative endogenous promoter of Ppp 1 cc or by the testis specific human Pgk 2 promoter, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the 2. 6 -kb genomic region directly upstream of the Ppp 1 cc structural gene can drive expression of Ppp 1 cc 2, and recapitulate the wild-type tissue specificity of PPP 1 CC 2 in transgenic mice. More importantly, we show that expression of PPP 1 CC 2 alone, via either promoter, is able not only to restore normal spermatogenesis, but the fertility of Ppp 1 cc null mice as well, provided that transgenic PPP 1 CC 2 expression in testis reaches at least a lower threshold level equivalent to approximately 50 % of its expression by a Ppp 1 cc +/ 2 male.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} phase {{centre of}} a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna does not {{coincide with the}} physical one and depends on the azimuth and elevation of the incoming signals. To improve processing results, the International GNSS Service has developed antenna phase centre corrections (PCC), which include models for constant and variable biases, i. e. phase centre offsets and phase centre variations. By assuming that the small differences in PCCs between antenna/radome combinations of the same type/model are negligible, so called type-mean PCCs have been generated and, for practical reasons, have been widely applied. The type-mean PCCs are averaged corrections, which are composed from several individual PCCs. Contrary to the general assumption, individual PCCs may sometimes be significantly different for antennas of the same type {{and it can be}} argued, that the use of type-mean instead of individual calibrations may degrade GNSS-derived products, such as satellite orbits and station coordinates. Furthermore, through simple geometric considerations it can be shown that inaccuracies in the PCCs may propagate into time series of GNSS solutions and may contribute some power at the orbital frequencies and their harmonics. In this study we assess the impact of the applied antenna PCCs on satellite orbits and station coordinates. As the availability of individual PCCs for GNSS stations is very limited, we analyzed a global network with stations mainly located in Europe. We used 10 years of GPS data in our processing. Despite the limitations imposed by the poor network geometry, we observed improvements in orbit overlaps at day boundaries when individual antenna PCCs were used compared to the respective type-mean solutions. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of the applied PCCs on Precise Point Positioning (PPP) station coordinates using our computed orbits. Our preliminary results showed that out of two PPP runs, the one with individual PCCs and respective orbit set reduced the noise in solutions compared to the <b>other</b> <b>PPP</b> run. We conclude that the use of individual PCCs is advantageous for derived GNSS products, as improvements are observed both in the estimated satellite orbits and station coordinate time series...|$|E

It is a more powerful prediction tool than MIC for determining the antimicrobial action of plant extracts, as it depicts time related rate of bactericidal activity (Ojo et al. 2013; Ruppen and Sendi 2015). Encouragingly, no re-growth was observed in any test organism against all the test extracts, i.e., the extracts exhibited bactericidal nature, which will be quite useful when considered for drug development purpose. Organic extract {{was found to be}} the most efficient of all with lesser kill time (0 – 12  h), whereas, flavonoids were most effective among PPPs, as they took from 0 to 8  h for complete killing. The efficiency of flavonoids was better or comparable to the kill time of standard antibiotic gentamicin (2 – 24  h) as well as <b>other</b> <b>PPPs.</b> It was observed that the kill time of test extracts for organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Salmonella typhimurium 2 and Candida albicans was better than the kill time of gentamicin. It was equal for one or more compounds in case of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA, thus providing further credence to the study. The study also holds significance as the organic extract was more effective than amphotericin B against Candida tropicalis, where the former took only 12  h for complete killing as compared to 24  h respectively. This time kill study revealed better results than the previous study on Moringa oleifera organic extract, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and MRSA were killed at 12, 24 and 10  h respectively (Arora and Onsare 2014 b). Further, before taking a natural compound to the level of commercialization and intending it for human use, it is necessary to make sure of its non cytotoxic profile. The extracts used in this study were found to be non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic as demonstrated by MTT assay and Ames test respectively. Such biosafety of some other medicinal plants as well as some fungi has also been demonstrated previously (Arora and Chandra 2011; Kasolo et al. 2011; Ping et al. 2013; Kaur et al. 2014).|$|R
