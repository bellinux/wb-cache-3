5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E

5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956. Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Summer Olympics, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received out <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible {{to participate in the}} Olympics. Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers Ian Dick and Maurice Foley were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 195657 Sheffield Shield season because {{he was part of the}} Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.

5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E

40|$|Background: Periodontal {{surgery is}} {{indicated}} in the treatment <b>of</b> persistent <b>pockets</b> following cause-related therapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the long-term effect of supportive therapy in periodontal patients treated with fibre retention osseous resective surgery. Methods: Three-hundred and four consecutive patients were identified and retrospectively examined while presenting for a supportive periodontal care (SPC) appointment (T 2). All had received non-surgical periodontal treatment and osseous resective surgery as needed, to obtain no sites with probing depth (PD) > 3 mm before being enrolled in the SPC programme. The mean SPC duration for the patients was 7. 8 ± 3. 2 years while the mean interval of SPC was 3. 4 ± 0. 8 months. Results: During SPC, a total of 67 teeth had been removed (0. 9 %). At T 2, mean full-mouth plaque scores (FMPS) was 13 ± 11. 3 % and full-mouth bleeding scores (FMBS) was 2 ± 3 %. In 98. 5 % of the sites, PD was minimal (≤ 3 mm). The majority <b>of</b> <b>pockets</b> at T 2 showed PDs of 4 - 5 mm (83. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>pockets).</b> At the same time, the total number <b>of</b> <b>pockets</b> ≥ 6 mm was 68 and limited to 41 patients (13. 8 % of sample). Initial periodontal diagnosis of severe periodontitis, smoking habits, FMBS, number of teeth at completion of active periodontal therapy (T 1), number of surgically treated teeth, number of teeth with furcation involvement and number of multi-rooted teeth were associated with the number <b>of</b> <b>pockets</b> at T 2. A total of 598 sites (2. 1 %) displayed bleeding on probing (BOP) at T 2. The odds ratio of sites 4 mm or deeper to be BOP positive was 32. 9 compared with sites of < 3 mm depth. Gender, FMBS, FMPS, furcation involvements and overall number <b>of</b> <b>pockets</b> were associated with the number <b>of</b> bleeding <b>pockets</b> at T 2. Conclusion: Shallow PDs achieved by treatment <b>of</b> the persistent <b>pockets</b> by fibre retention osseous resective surgery can be maintained over time. These patients displayed minimal gingival inflammation and tooth loss during SPC. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
