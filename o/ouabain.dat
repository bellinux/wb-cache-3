25|$|A {{traditional}} {{application of}} methylene blue is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887. A dilute {{solution of the}} dye is either injected into tissue or applied to small freshly removed pieces. The selective blue coloration develops with exposure to air (oxygen) and can be fixed by immersion of the stained specimen in an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. Vital methylene blue was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs. The mechanism of selective dye uptake is incompletely understood; vital staining of nerve fibers in skin is prevented by <b>ouabain,</b> a drug that inhibits the Na/K-ATPase of cell membranes.|$|E

2500|$|Cedric Stanton Hicks, Professor of {{physiology}} and pharmacology at the University of Adelaide, testified {{that of a}} group of drugs, variants of a drug in that group he called [...] "number 1" [...] and in particular [...] "number 2" [...] were extremely toxic in a relatively small oral dose that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to identify even if it had been suspected in the first instance. He gave the coroner a piece of paper with the names of the two drugs which was entered as Exhibit C.18. The names were not released to the public until the 1980s as at the time they were [...] "quite easily procurable by the ordinary individual" [...] from a chemist without the need to give a reason for the purchase. (The drugs were later publicly identified as digitalis and <b>ouabain,</b> both of which are cardenolide-type cardiac glycosides). He noted the only [...] "fact" [...] not found in relation to the body was evidence of vomiting. He then stated its absence was not unknown but that he could not make a [...] "frank conclusion" [...] without it. Hicks stated that if death had occurred seven hours after the man was last seen to move, it would imply a massive dose that could still have been undetectable. It was noted that the movement seen by witnesses at 7 p.m. could have been the last convulsion preceding death.|$|E

Although <b>ouabain</b> is no longer approved for use in the USA, in France and Germany, intravenous <b>ouabain</b> has a long history in the treatment of heart failure, and some continue to advocate its use intravenously and per os (orally) in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction despite its poor and variable absorption.

5000|$|In 1991, a {{specific}} high affinity sodium pump inhibitor indistinguishable from <b>ouabain</b> was first {{discovered in the}} human circulation [...] and proposed {{as one of the}} potential mediators of long term blood pressure and the enhanced salt excretion following salt and volume loading. This agent was an inhibitor of the sodium pump that acted similarly to digitalis. A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was <b>ouabain</b> and that humans were producing it as an endogenous hormone. A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous <b>ouabain</b> and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous <b>ouabain</b> may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant <b>ouabain.</b> However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from <b>ouabain.</b> Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of <b>ouabain</b> in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere ...|$|E

50|$|In their synthesis, Zhang et al. {{from the}} Deslongchamps {{laboratory}} condensed cyclohexenone A with Nazarov substitute B {{in a double}} Michael addition to produce tricycle C. At the indicated position, C was reduced to the aldehyde and the alcohol group was protected with p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) to form the aldol precursor needed to produce D. After several steps, intermediate E was produced. E contained all the required functionalities and stereochemistry needed to produce <b>ouabain.</b> The structure of E was confirmed by comparison against the degradation product of <b>ouabain.</b> Methylation of E, catalyzed by rhodium, produced F. The dehydroxylation and selective oxidation of the secondary hydroxy group of F produced G. G reacted with triphenyl phosphoranylidene ketene and the ester bonds in G were hydrolyzed to produce ouabagenin, a precursor to <b>ouabain.</b> The glycosylation of ouabagenin to add the rhamnose moiety produced <b>ouabain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The total {{synthesis}} of <b>ouabain</b> was achieved in 2008 by Deslongchamps laboratory in Canada.

5000|$|Despite {{widespread}} analytical confirmation, some {{questioned whether}} or not this endogenous substance is <b>ouabain.</b> The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous <b>ouabain</b> detected other compounds or failed to detect <b>ouabain</b> at all. Additionally, it was suggested [...] that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of <b>ouabain,</b> could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous <b>ouabain</b> was the lack of effect of rostafuroxin (a first generation <b>ouabain</b> receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients. However, in a follow on analysis, where hypertensive patients were {{selected on the basis of}} their genotype, rostafuroxin lowered blood pressure significantly in the target group with a quantitative effect comparable to that of an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist. Further, there is mounting evidence from clinical studies that elevated circulating levels of endogenous <b>ouabain,</b> as measured by immunoassay, are associated with adverse outcomes in a variety of chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases. It may be noted also that work from experimental animal studies indicates that many of the adverse actions of EO likely involve angiotensinergic pathways in the central nervous system. [...] Accumulating evidence suggests also that EO is not simply a bystander entity (biomarker) but rather that elevated circulating levels of EO (with the exception of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia [...] ) appear to be a direct contributor to the adverse outcomes among the various patient populations mentioned above. This conclusion contrasts with the positive impression given in the medical uses of <b>ouabain</b> noted below. However, there may be a relatively straightforward explanation. With the exception of the CHF study, the most obvious difference is the absence of overt preexisting myocardial infarction or coronary insufficiency in the patients recruited in most all of the above noted clinical studies and its invariable presence in most of the patient populations mentioned below.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ouabain</b> [...] or [...] (from Somali waabaayo, [...] "arrow poison" [...] through French ouabaïo) {{also known}} as g-strophanthin, is a plant derived toxic {{substance}} that was traditionally used as an arrow poison in eastern Africa for both hunting and warfare. <b>Ouabain</b> is a cardiac glycoside and in lower doses, can be used medically to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting the Na/K-ATPase, {{also known as}} the sodium-potassium ion pump.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ouabain</b> is {{a cardiac}} {{glycoside}} that acts by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase sodium-potassium ion pump. Once <b>ouabain</b> binds to this enzyme, the enzyme ceases to function, {{leading to an}} increase of intracellular sodium. This increase in intracellular sodium reduces {{the activity of the}} sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which pumps one calcium ion out of the cell and three sodium ions into the cell down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the decrease in the concentration gradient of sodium into the cell which occurs when the Na/K-ATPase is inhibited reduces the ability of the NCX to function. This in turn elevates intracellular calcium. This results in higher cardiac contractility and an increase in cardiac vagal tone. The change in ionic gradients caused by <b>ouabain</b> can also affect the membrane voltage of the cell and result in cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
5000|$|Arenobufagin is {{believed}} {{to play a role}} in the regulation of the transport of water and electrolytes across cell membranes under physiological conditions. Experimental results show that Arenobufagin inhibits the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) [...] It is one of the most potent blockers that are known to science, along with <b>ouabain.</b> It has been suggested that uncharged and non-polar amino acids may participate in the binding of arenobufagin to the extracellular surface of the ATPase. If this is the case, the steroid nucleus of arenobufagin probably also contributes to the binding. Furthermore, the presence of a sugar group in <b>ouabain</b> and the absence of one in arenobufagin suggests that it may me more lipophilic that <b>ouabain</b> and as such form a more stable complex with the Na+-K+ pump.|$|E
