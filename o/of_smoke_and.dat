5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A variety <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> {{smokeless}} tobacco products with varying nicotine content are accessible in India. Nicotine quantity in tobacco products has direct bearing on tobacco dependence. Our {{objective was to}} estimate nicotine content in various types <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless products. Disclosure for essential health warning was also checked. Materials and Methods: Liquid-liquid extraction was used for nicotine extraction and high-performance thin layer chromatography technique was applied for quantification of nicotine in seventy-one <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> {{smokeless tobacco}} products. Results: Significant variation in nicotine content was observed across products. In smoked tobacco, nicotine content varied from 1. 01 to 13. 0 mg/rod, while in smokeless tobacco products it ranged from 0. 8 mg/g to 50. 0 mg/g. Moisture content varied from 9 % to 21 %. Conclusion: This work lists a range <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless tobacco products available in this region. We report a wide variability in nicotine quantity across <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> smokeless tobacco products. Such variation in nicotine content may {{have important implications for}} tobacco cessation interventions and policies...|$|R

25|$|Smog is {{also caused}} by {{large amounts of}} coal burning, which creates a mixture <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide.

India produced about 447.3 million tons in 2006. 68.7% of China's electricity comes from coal. The USA consumes about 14% of the world total, using 90% of it for generation of electricity.|$|E
25|$|Particulates {{created from}} gaseous primary {{pollutants}} and compounds in photochemical smog. Smog {{is a kind}} of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{also indicated}} that the smoke and heat from the fire raced down the corridor and entered rooms where doors were left open. In addition, a window was left open, reducing the amount <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> toxic gas entering the chapel area and the lounge room thus preventing further fatalities. Investigators also cited the difficulty of moving elderly patients in wheelchairs to the nearby stairway and the inability of elderly patients of evacuating themselves from the third floor where the fire took place.|$|E

25|$|At {{the front}} of the boiler is the smokebox, into which used exhaust steam is {{injected}} to increase the draught <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> combustion gases through the fire tubes in the boiler and out through the chimney. The search for thermal efficiency greater than that of the typical fire-tube boiler led such engineers as Nigel Gresley to consider innovations such as the water-tube boiler. Although he tested the concept on the LNER Class W1, the difficulties during development exceeded the will to solve the efficiency problem at the time.|$|E
25|$|Human reason {{requires}} more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> the fire {{would have to be}} thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.|$|E
