40|$|Wheat is {{the most}} widely grown crop {{globally}} and an essential source of calories in human diets. Maintaining and increasing global wheat production is therefore strongly linked to food security. In this paper, the evaluation model <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> potential productivity was proposed based on agro-ecological zone and the historical winter wheat yield data in recent 30 years (1983 - 2011) obtained from FAO. And the potential productions <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in the world were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} realistic potential productivity <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in Western Europe was highest and it was more than 7500 kg/hm 2. The realistic potential productivity <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in North China Plain were also higher, which was about 6000 kg/hm 2. However, the realistic potential productivity <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in the United States which is the main winter wheat producing country were not high, only about 3000 kg/hm 2. In addition to these regions which were the main winter wheat producing areas, the realistic potential productivity in other regions of the world were very low and mainly less than 1500 kg/hm 2, like in southwest region of Russia. The gaps between potential productivity and realistic productivity <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in Kazakhstan and India were biggest, and the percentages of the gap in realistic productivity <b>of</b> winter <b>wheat</b> in Kazakhstan and India were more than 40 %.

40|$|Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) is {{used for}} {{production}} of semolina which is the required raw material for the elaboration of good quality pasta products. Common wheat (T. aestivum L,) t generally used in breadmaking, yields milling products (flour or fariña) that are not suitable for that purpose. Shortage and localization <b>of</b> durum <b>wheat</b> production, {{as well as its}} higher cost, have compelled the utilization <b>of</b> common <b>wheat</b> for the production of macaroni. When different blends of hérd or soft wheat (fariña or flour) with durum wheat are used, the quality of macaroni is reduced.
