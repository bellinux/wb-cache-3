5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E

In 2006, 233 of 280 or over 80% of new McDonald's opened outside the US. In 2007, Japan had 2,828 McDonald's locations.|$|E

He remained in Dodge City until the final months of 1883, although he made frequent trips to <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> pursue gambling opportunities. Short's friend, William H.

25|$|Ibn al-Nadim names a {{book titled}} Ardashir I's Testament to His Son Shapur among the books of preaches and ethics and doctrines. That is {{probably}} the same short text that is written with the version title Ardashir's Testament to His Son Shapur in the book Nahayat-ol Aarab attributed to Al-Asma'i. Apparently, Ibn al-Muqaffa' or more probably {{the author of the}} Seir-ol Moluk that was the reference of Nahayat-ol Aarab chose the text from the Arabic translation of Ardashir's Testament and added some matters from <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> it.

25|$|Guanajuato has {{the fourth}} lowest {{number of people}} who can speak an {{indigenous}} language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are Chichimeca Jonaz, Otomi and Nahuatl. The two most important indigenous groups are the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Otomi, both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as pitayas, Myrtillocactus geometrizans (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and agave. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> find work.|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag because I {{thought that was a}} way to show I was gay. It's changed now, but in the early 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, {{an orphanage}} located nearby Kenmore Asylum was {{proposed}} at a general meeting of parishioners to replace an older orphanage {{that had been}} operating for more than 25 years on Clinton Street. The orphanage, which had catered to girls only, cared for approximately 50 girls per year, and the [...] of land on which it was situated proved insufficient for the orphans. Thus, [...] of land was purchased in nearby Kenmore for the proposed orphanage. Shortly after, the foundation stone was laid and blessed on the site. EC Manfred was the building's architect, and the contractors were Messrs. King and Armstrong. It was described as [...] "severely simple Gothic" [...] and cost £6,000 to build. [...] All of the girls from the old orphanage were removed, and boys aged eight and older were moved there and waited for a permanent home. An effort was made for people from Albury, Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Young and <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> {{take charge of the}} orphanage, but this was unsuccessful. Instead, the orphanage was established in Goulburn.|$|E
500|$|For the sequel, Zombie {{only used}} Carpenter's {{original}} theme {{music in the}} final scene of the film, though the director admits that he and music composer Tyler Bates tried to find <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> include it. According to Zombie, Carpenter's music did not fit with {{what was happening in}} the film; whenever he or Bates would insert it into a scene it [...] "just wouldn't feel right" [...] to the director. Zombie also used popular culture songs throughout the film, with [...] "Nights in White Satin" [...] appearing the most prominently. Zombie chose songs that he liked, and that would enhance a given scene within the film. An official soundtrack for the film was released on August 25, 2009. In addition, an album featuring the music of psychobilly band Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures was released in conjunction with Halloween II on August 28, 2009. Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures is a fictional band that appears in Halloween II. Nan Vernon, who recorded a new version of the song [...] "Mr. Sandman" [...] for the end credits of the 2007 remake, recorded a cover of [...] "Love Hurts" [...] for Halloween II.|$|E

5000|$|In Queensland, section 72 of the Criminal Code of 1899 defines affray {{as taking}} part in a fight in a public highway or {{taking part in}} a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any <b>other</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which the public have access. This {{definition}} is taken from that in the English Criminal Code Bill of 1880, cl. 96. Section 72 says [...] "Any person who takes part in a fight in a public place, or takes part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any <b>other</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which the public have access, commits a misdemeanour.

500|$|New York Dolls {{was mixed}} {{in less than}} half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he {{minimized}} the sound of Nolan's drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: [...] "It's too easy for it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> be, so rather than split, they rushed the thing and if that wasn't enough they took it to the crappy mastering lab that Mercury had put them in." [...] Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren [...] "fucked up the mix" [...] on New York Dolls, adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album's recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders' typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument, giving listeners the impression that [...] " [...] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.|$|E

50|$|Radicalization {{that occurs}} across {{multiple}} reinforcing pathways greatly increases a group’s resilience and lethality. Furthermore, by compromising {{its ability to}} blend in with non-radical society and participate in a modern, national economy, radicalization serves as a kind of sociological trap that gives individuals no <b>other</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go to satisfy their material and spiritual needs.|$|R

He asked his subjects for [...] "measurements" [...] to ensure accuracyage, height, weight, hat size and even place of birth. In all, the picture included 269 separate portraits.

2500|$|When he was 14, the Spanish tennis {{federation}} {{requested that}} he leave Mallorca {{and move to}} Barcelona to continue his tennis training. Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni said that [...] "I don't {{want to believe that}} {{you have to go to}} America, or <b>other</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> be a good athlete. You can do it from your home." [...] The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.|$|E
