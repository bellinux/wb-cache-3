5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured.

5|$|A {{series of}} air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of persuading the {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once {{it became clear that the}} Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 70 Squadron RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 216 Squadron RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 208 Squadron RAF directed the artillery fire. Fighters from No. 33 Squadron RAF, No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 274 Squadron RAF patrolled between Bardia and Tobruk.|$|E

A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims <b>of</b> <b>No.</b> 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E
40|$|SummarySpatial {{control of}} mRNA {{translation}} can generate cellular asymmetries and functional specialization of polarized cells like neurons. A {{requirement for the}} translational repressor Nanos (Nos) in the Drosophila larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) implicates translational control in dendrite morphogenesis [1]. Nos was first identified by its requirement in the posterior of the early embryo for abdomen formation [2]. Nos synthesis is targeted to the posterior pole of the oocyte and early embryo through translational repression of unlocalized nos mRNA coupled with translational activation <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> mRNA localized at the posterior pole [3, 4]. Abolishment <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> localization prevents abdominal development, whereas translational derepression <b>of</b> unlocalized <b>nos</b> mRNA suppresses head/thorax development, emphasizing the importance of spatial regulation <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> mRNA [3, 5]. Loss and overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> affect dendrite branching complexity in class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons, suggesting that nos also might be regulated in these larval sensory neurons [1]. Here, we show that localization and translational control <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> mRNA are essential for da neuron morphogenesis. RNA-protein interactions that regulate nos translation in the oocyte and early embryo also regulate nos in the PNS. Live imaging <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> mRNA shows that the cis-acting signal responsible for posterior localization in the oocyte/embryo mediates localization to the processes of class IV da neurons but suggests a different transport mechanism. Targeting <b>of</b> <b>nos</b> mRNA to the processes of da neurons may reflect a local requirement for Nos protein in dendritic translational control...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{work over}} the past several years has {{revealed}} an unexpected abundance of long natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in eukaryotic species. In light of the proposed role of such RNA molecules in the regulation of gene expression in the brain, attention is now focused on specific examples of neuronal NATs. Of particular interest are NATs that are complementary to mRNAs encoding nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for production of the important gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO). Here we study the temporal expression profile <b>of</b> murine <b>Nos</b> 3 as NAT in the brain. Notably, Nos 3 as NAT is known to act as a negative regulator <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 gene expression. The results of our quantitative analysis reveal differential expression <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 as NAT during embryonic and post-embryonic stages of development of the brain. Also, they show that the low levels <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 as NAT coincides with active neurogenesis. In addition we report on an inverse correlation between the relative expression level <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 as NAT and the level <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 protein. Thus our data raise the hypothesis that the Nos 3 as NAT regulates neurogenesis through suppression <b>of</b> <b>Nos</b> 3 gene activity. This idea is further supported by experiments conducted on the olfactory bulbs and cultured neuroblastoma cells...|$|R
