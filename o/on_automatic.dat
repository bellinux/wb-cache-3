5|$|He spent £200,000 on striker Andy Preece, {{and also}} brought in young defender Jason Lydiate and goalkeeper Steve Banks for the 1995–96 campaign. Blackpool {{finished}} third, missing out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion {{on the last}} day of the season, and were beaten in the play-off semi-finals by Bradford City. They had won 2–0 away at Valley Parade, only to lose 3–0 in the return leg at Bloomfield Road. Chairman Owen Oyston, while he was in a prison cell, sacked Allardyce shortly after the play-off defeat. Allardyce then had a brief spell on the coaching staff under Peter Reid at Sunderland, working as director of the academy.|$|E

5|$|Roseville Tower was the {{interlocking}} {{tower at}} street-level in Roseville that handled the nearby {{fork of the}} three lines (Montclair, Morristown and Gladstone). The tower was used on limited services, with only three different shifts, two of which were manned. The tower was run from 5 a.m. {{in the morning to}} 10 p.m. in the evening manned.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013–14 season, Hughton's second as manager, {{shortly before}} Norwich were relegated back to the Championship, Hughton was {{replaced}} by former Norwich player Neil Adams. After a mediocre first half of the 2014–15 season, Adams resigned and Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil was appointed in January 2015; at 33 years old, he was the second youngest manager in the Football League. The appointment reinvigorated Norwich's season and after narrowly missing out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion back to the Premier League, victory in the 2015 Championship playoff final secured an immediate return to the top division of English football. During the 2015-16 season, former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was appointed Chairman. At the end of that season, Norwich were relegated once more, to play season 2016/17 in the Football League Championship. When {{it became clear that the}} club would not be promoted, Neil left his post and was replaced in May 2017 by German coach, Daniel Farke, on a two-year contract.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Chestnut Hill Ventures, led by American John Berylson, {{which have}} {{interests}} {{in business and}} financial services, retail, property and sport, invested £5 million into the club. The continued investment of Berylson, who has since become the club's major shareholder and chairman, has steered The Lions on a better course {{on and off the}} pitch. The appointment of Kenny Jackett as manager on 6 November 2007, proving crucial. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons Jackett led Millwall to two top six finishes in League One, in fifth and third place respectively. He won the League One Manager of the Month award three times while in charge of the club. Several of his key signings helped propel Millwall toward the play-offs, and eventual promotion. After a play-off final defeat in the 2008–09 season against Scunthorpe United and losing out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion on the last day of the 2009–10 season to Leeds United by one point, Millwall made it back to Wembley, finally breaking the play-off hoodoo run of five successive failures in 1991, 1994, 2000, 2002 and 2009, with a 1–0 win in the 2010 League One play-off final against Swindon Town, securing a return to the Football League Championship after a four-year absence.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, playoffs to {{determine}} promotion places were introduced for the 1986–87 season {{so that more}} clubs remained eligible for promotion closer {{to the end of}} the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams to miss out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988–89 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986–87 was indeed the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.|$|E

50|$|Closed-circuit {{television}} (CCTV) monitoring {{is used by}} {{many public}} transport companies to combat vandalism and other public order crimes. Using CCTV to apprehend fare-dodgers in the act requires full-time human monitoring of the cameras. Sophisticated CCTV systems discriminate the scenes to detect and segregate suspicious behaviour from numerous screens and to enable automatic alerting. However, the attentiveness of the surveillance personnel may be threatened by false reliance <b>on</b> <b>automatics.</b>|$|R

The team had only a four-day turn-around after their first match, and let the game slip out of their reach within the final 20 minutes. They produced a repeat result of 2007, by playing to a 23–23 draw against Japan. Their Rugby World Cup concluded with a 79–15 loss against the All Blacks.

It was Brentford's best ever start to a season, losing {{only once in}} their first 10 matches, {{and that was to}} Sir Bobby Robson's Newcastle United side at St James' Park. Coppell's side spent most of the season behind Brighton & Hove Albion and Reading in the table. Coppell took them to the Division Two play-off final in 2002 after they had narrowly missed out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion, conceding a late equaliser to Coppell's future side Reading in the end-of-season decider. They lost in the play-off final to Stoke City. After this, Coppell resigned, citing the club's lack of finances.|$|E

The club finished third, missing out <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion, and in the two-legged play-off semi-final were beaten by Blackpool, 2–1 away and 4–3 in the home leg, the club's first defeat at home since losing to the same opposition in September 2009.|$|E
