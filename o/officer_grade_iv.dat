40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the long-term results of stapled hemorrhoidopexy in 291 patients with Grade III and <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> hemorrhoids after a minimum follow-up of five years. METHODS: Records of patients submitted to stapled hemorrhoidopexy for Grade III and <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> hemorrhoids between January 1999 and December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. Long-term outcome was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire and an office visit, including anorectal examination and rigid proctoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 291 patients with Grade III (57. 4 percent) and <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> (42. 6 percent) hemorrhoids were evaluated. Intraoperative (20. 3 percent) and postoperative (4. 8 percent) bleeding was the most frequent complication. The questionnaire was submitted to all patients at a median follow-up of 73 (range 60 - 93) months. There were no symptoms related to hemorrhoids in 65. 3 percent of patients, moderate symptoms in 25. 4 percent of patients, and severe symptoms in 9. 3 percent of patients. Fifty-three (18. 2 percent) patients had recurrence. Reoperation was necessary in 21 (7. 2 percent) patients (4 in Grade III hemorrhoids and 17 in <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> hemorrhoids; P < 0. 001), with no recurrent symptoms and/or prolapse. Patient satisfaction for operation was 89. 7 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is a safe and effective treatment for Grade III and <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> hemorrhoids. Recurrence requiring reoperation was higher in <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> hemorrhoids than in Grade III hemorrhoids...|$|R

40|$|Context: Renal {{trauma is}} {{increasingly}} being managed conservatively. Grade I-III injuries are managed conservatively whereas Grade V injuries may end in surgery. Managing <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal trauma is individualized and managed accordingly. Aims: To evaluate retrospectively all <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal injuries managed in our institute {{over five years}} and to review the available literature. Settings and Design: Reviewing the records of patients who sustained renal trauma and study all <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal injuries. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal injuries (16) managed at our institute between July 2008 -August 2013. All patients were treated conservatively initially by hemodynamic stabilization, strict bed rest, if required endoscopic procedures. These patients were followed up with CECT. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics was performed using Microsoft excel spreadsheet 2007. Continuous data were described as mean and range. Categorical data was described as percentages. Results: Sixteen patients with <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal injury {{were included in the}} study. All patients had gross hematuria and 15 had urinary extravasation. D-J Stenting was done in 7 patients; perinephric tube drainage with D-J stentingwas done in 2 patients. One required selective upper pole arterial embolisation. Nephrectomy was not required in any of the patients. In the follow-up period, no patient had delayed complications. Conclusions: Successful conservative management of <b>Grade</b> <b>IV</b> renal trauma requires constant monitoring both clinically and radiologically, and if properly managed, kidneys can be salvaged in all stable patients as reinforced by our study...|$|R
