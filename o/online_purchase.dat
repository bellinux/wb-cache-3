Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E

The present study examines particular factors that influence the attitude of potential consumers to <b>purchase</b> <b>online</b> by using the attributes from the diffusion of innovations theory of Rogers, the attribute of perception of risk, and the subjective norms toward <b>online</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Consumers’ perceived risks of online shopping have become a vital subject in research because they directly influence users’ attitude toward <b>online</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The structural equation modeling method was {{used to analyze the}} data gathered on students using e-commerce, and, thus, to validate the model.

40|$|Although <b>online</b> <b>purchases</b> {{still make}} up only a small share of individuals' purchases, they {{increasingly}} represent an alternative to in-store purchases. This alternative seems even more valuable in sparsely populated areas with poorer access to shops. <b>Online</b> <b>purchases</b> may smooth out spatial constraints on access to tangible goods. The efficiency hypothesis postulates that people with low accessibility tend to buy more online. This study examines this hypothesis. The aim is to check whether <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> is more developed in suburban areas and whether <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> practices for the inhabitants of such areas are a way of overcoming their poor access to shops. Our results show quite different patterns between suburban and urban households. The efficiency hypothesis is partially validated...|$|R
25|$|Viacom put $100 million toward online gaming initiatives, {{such as a}} subscription-based {{educational}} {{site called}} MyNoggin, in July 2007. The MyNoggin website was initially scheduled to launch in early September of that year, but was not {{made available to the}} public until October. The site's content was curriculum-based and intended for children in preschool through first grade. The games on MyNoggin covered major school subjects and included Noggin characters. In addition to activities, MyNoggin included printable workbooks that expanded upon math and science concepts. Parents were able to monitor their children's growth and activity on the site through daily progress reports. The website was free of advertisements and supported by subscriptions, which were available for <b>online</b> <b>purchase</b> and through prepaid game cards sold throughout 2008. Charter, Insight and Cox Communications customers were given unlimited access to MyNoggin as part of their cable subscriptions. The site also offered a week-long free trial.|$|E

Travelcards {{can also be}} renewed online via the Oystercard website, or by telephone sales from TfL; users must then nominate a Tube or overground station where they will tap their card in order to charge the card with the funds or season ticket purchased. Alternatively a user can choose to automatically add either £20 or £40 every time the balance on the card falls below £10.

40|$|Consumers’ {{direct use}} of Internet to <b>purchase</b> <b>online</b> still remains poor. This {{reluctance}} is a difficulty {{for the survival}} of e-commerce-based firms. It is then necessary to better attest for the reasons which push consumers to adopt or reject <b>purchasing</b> <b>online.</b> It is with these concerns that this study tries to determine the factors explaining <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> behaviour.

This study adds to the existing literature the empirical validation of a model that integrates the effect of experience, gender and the traditional variables of the technology acceptance model on <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> intention.

40|$|Although {{multi-channel}} retailers can leverage on offline {{advantages for}} their online sales, {{it has been}} challenging for them to attract customers to make repeated <b>online</b> <b>purchases.</b> This {{can be attributed to}} the development of online trust which has long been cited as central for customers to continually make <b>online</b> <b>purchases</b> from retailers. Even though online trust has been extensively studied in marketing and MIS literature, research efforts generally focus on pure online retailers and there has been no research to investigate the development of online trust in multi-channel retailers during the postpurchase phase. After making initial <b>online</b> <b>purchases</b> from the multi-channel retailer, customers are likely to encounter or even search for information sources (social contacts and online reviews) that may be dissonant with their own <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> experiences, causing them to reevaluate their online trust. Hence, this paper addresses the following research question: How do customers jointly evaluate post-purchase information sources and their own <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> experiences to reformulate online trust? Since multi-channel retailers have offline and online channels of sales to their customers, we are also interested to investigate: How do customers evaluate their offline and <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> experiences to reformulate online trust during the post-purchase phase? This paper draws on the cognitive dissonance theory to present a model of online trust development in multichannel retailers during the post-purchase phase...|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} two knowledge-related constructs (i. e., consumer competency {{and product}} knowledge) into <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> expenditures and then analyses variables (i. e., convenience, trust, and privacy) {{that have been}} discussed in existing literature in order to investigate how knowledge plays out in the <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> context. The findings, derived from the responses of 124 survey participants, show that consumer competency is the focal element of online expenditures. While convenient service {{is still one of}} the most important factors, trust and privacy do not directly impact online expenditures. It is interpreted that competent consumers, who are already determined to <b>purchase</b> something <b>online,</b> are able to locate trustworthy sites and make purchases from those sites; consequently, these issues that are traditionally considered important do not necessarily dissuade consumers' online expenditures, but may affect individual web sites. This study shows that consumers' knowledge about technology and the Web are the main determining factors for <b>online</b> <b>purchasing</b> expenditures.
