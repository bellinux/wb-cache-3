5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within <b>one-dimensional</b> {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of <b>one-dimensional</b> crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have continuous DOS. The sharp peaks found in <b>one-dimensional</b> materials are called Van Hove singularities.|$|E
5|$|Although the Pythagorean tiling {{is itself}} {{periodic}} (it has a square lattice of translational symmetries) its cross sections {{can be used}} to generate <b>one-dimensional</b> aperiodic sequences.|$|E
5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, moving at equal speeds in opposite directions in a <b>one-dimensional</b> medium.|$|E
5|$|In string theory, the {{fundamental}} objects that {{give rise to}} elementary particles are the <b>one-dimensional</b> strings. Although the physical phenomena described by M-theory are still poorly understood, physicists know that the theory describes two- and five-dimensional branes. Much of the current research in M-theory attempts to better understand the properties of these branes.|$|E
5|$|Quantum {{gravity is}} {{the branch of}} physics that seeks to {{describe}} gravity using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as <b>one-dimensional</b> objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Rule 184 can be {{understood}} in terms of ballistic annihilation, a system of particles moving both leftwards and rightwards through a <b>one-dimensional</b> medium. When two such particles collide, they annihilate each other, so that at each step the number of particles remains unchanged or decreases.|$|E
5|$|The set of <b>one-dimensional</b> subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional {{vector space}} V {{is known as}} {{projective}} space; it {{may be used to}} formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension k and flags of subspaces, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as <b>one-dimensional</b> objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the <b>one-dimensional</b> diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a <b>one-dimensional</b> geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the <b>one-dimensional</b> case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
25|$|As in the <b>one-dimensional</b> case, {{the energy}} is quantized. The ground state energy is N times the <b>one-dimensional</b> ground energy, {{as we would}} expect using the analogy to N {{independent}} <b>one-dimensional</b> oscillators. There is one further difference: in the <b>one-dimensional</b> case, each energy level corresponds to a unique quantum state. In N-dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning there are several states with the same energy.|$|E
25|$|Single-variable or <b>one-dimensional</b> {{recurrence}} {{relations are}} about sequences (i.e. functions defined on <b>one-dimensional</b> grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about n-dimensional grids. Functions defined on n-grids {{can also be}} studied with partial difference equations.|$|E
25|$|The inverse of a multi-dimensional DCT {{is just a}} {{separable}} {{product of}} the inverse(s) of the corresponding <b>one-dimensional</b> DCT(s) (see above), e.g. the <b>one-dimensional</b> inverses applied along one dimension {{at a time in}} a row-column algorithm.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the uniformization theorem, a central {{result in the}} {{classification}} of Riemann surfaces, states that the only simply-connected <b>one-dimensional</b> complex manifolds are the complex plane, the hyperbolic plane, and the Riemann sphere. Of these, the Riemann sphere {{is the only one}} that is a closed surface (a compact surface without boundary). Hence the two-dimensional sphere admits a unique complex structure turning it into a <b>one-dimensional</b> complex manifold.|$|E

25|$|A Gaussian blur {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values. In practice, {{it is best}} {{to take advantage of the}} Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a <b>one-dimensional</b> kernel is used to blur the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same <b>one-dimensional</b> kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass, but requires fewer calculations.|$|E
25|$|A median is only defined on ordered <b>one-dimensional</b> data, and is {{independent}} of any distance metric. A geometric median, on the other hand, is defined {{in any number of}} dimensions.|$|E
25|$|If this {{is indeed}} not {{coincidental}} then the inscription is not a <b>one-dimensional</b> text. Of course this does not give us a decipherment; rather it narrows down the potential decipherments.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is <b>one-dimensional,</b> while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a <b>one-dimensional</b> simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be the reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
