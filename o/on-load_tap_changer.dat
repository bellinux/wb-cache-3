50|$|To {{maintain}} the voltage at the customer's service within the acceptable range, electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at electrical substations or along the distribution line. At a substation, the step-down transformer {{will have an}} automatic <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps. For long (several kilometres) rural distribution circuits, automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line. These are autotransformers, again, with on-load tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes. At each customer's service, the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment, usually ±5% of the nominal voltage. Since these taps are not automatically controlled, they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} 50 years {{electricity}} demand has significantly increased. Large amounts of electricity are transported from the {{generation to the}} consumption sites. Overhead lines or underground cables are used to transport the required energy. High voltage levels are used to reduce the transmission losses. Power transformers are responsible for linking the different voltage levels. In addition, power transformers must regulate the voltage of the electricity grid when needed. To achieve the regulation of the voltage, power transformers are equipped with <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> (OLTC). The winding of the transformer is equipped with tapped windings. The function of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is to adjust the output voltage of the power transformer by selecting the different tapped windings and without interrupting the load current. Different OLTC technologies {{are used in the}} market. The most commonly used technology of the last 50 - 60 years is the conventional oil type OLTC (OILTAP). In the last few years, time based maintenance is systematically being replaced by condition based maintenance. Condition based maintenance aims to reduce the costs that are associated with the maintenance of high voltage equipment and prevent possible failures. <b>On-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> constitute a vulnerable part of the power transformer and there is a number of power transformer failures attributed to OLTC failures. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the condition of <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> The condition assessment of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> leads to a decision about the appropriate maintenance. This thesis investigates the possibility of a new diagnostic tool for <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> based on partial discharge (PD) measurements. The research project focuses on the major insulation defects that could hamper the operation of <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> The differences between PD activity in star and delta connected <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> are also investigated in this thesis. The conditions that are present in <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> are initially modeled by the use of small scale set ups. Signature PD patterns associated with the major insulation defects are obtained from the small scale set up. In addition, PD measurements are also performed in a small, single phase <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> and in a large three phase, star connected <b>tap</b> <b>changer.</b> The main purpose of this research project is to investigate the applicability of PD measurements as a diagnostic tool to assess the condition of the insulation of <b>on-load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> Intelligent Electrical Power GridsElectrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

In the second stage, another combined data set is formed by analyzing the trend of false responses in primary results. Results show significant improvement in performance when combined data set is used for training.
