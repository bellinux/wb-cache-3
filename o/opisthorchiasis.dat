5000|$|Clonorchiasis and <b>opisthorchiasis</b> (due to Opisthorchis viverrini) are {{particularly}} dangerous.

50|$|Chloroquine {{was used}} unsuccessfully in {{attempts}} to treat <b>opisthorchiasis</b> in 1951-1968. Control of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> relies predominantly on antihelminthic treatment with praziquantel. The single dose of praziquantel of 40 mg/kg is effective against <b>opisthorchiasis</b> (and also against schistosomiasis). Despite the efficacy of this compound, {{the lack of an}} acquired immunity to infection predisposes humans to reinfections in endemic regions. In addition, under experimental conditions, the short-term treatment of Opisthorchis viverrini-infected hamsters with praziquantel (400 mg per kg of live weight) induced a dispersion of parasite antigens, resulting in adverse immunopathological changes as a result of oxidative and nitrative stresses following re-infection with Opisthorchis viverrini, a process which has been proposed to initiate and/or promote the development of cholangiocarcinoma in humans. Albendazole can be used as an alternative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opisthorchiasis,</b> {{the disease}} caused by Opisthorchis felineus, ranges in {{severity}} from asymptomatic infection to severe illness. Patient outcome {{is dependent on}} early detection and treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opisthorchiasis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by {{species in the}} genus Opisthorchis (specifically, Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus). Chronic infection may lead to cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant cancer of the bile ducts.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> {{caused by}} Opisthorchis viverrini and by Opisthorchis felineus are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by Clonorchis sinensis, so the disease by these three parasites should be {{referred}} as clonorchiasis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{clinical}} trials, it {{was highly}} effective in treating ankylostomiasis, ascariasis and enterobiasis.

50|$|Medical {{care and}} loss of wages caused by Opisthorchis viverrini in Laos and in Thailand costs about $120 million annually.

50|$|Two {{weeks after}} flukes enter the body, the parasites infect the biliary tract. Symptoms of {{infection}} include fever, general felling of tiredness, skin rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

50|$|Praziquantel, {{sold under}} the brandname Biltricide among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} a number of types of parasitic worm infections.

It {{should not be used}} for cysticercosis that involves the eye. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{foodborne}} trematode infections include clonorchiasis, <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> fascioliasis, and paragonimiasis. These {{infections are}} all zoonotic, primarily affecting domestic or wild animals, but also transmitted to humans. They are acquired by eating food, such as raw fish, contaminated with the larval {{stages of the}} parasites. At least 40 million people {{are thought to be}} infected.|$|E
50|$|Opisthorchis viverrini, {{common name}} Southeast Asian liver fluke, is a food-borne {{trematode}} parasite {{from the family}} Opisthorchiidae that attacks {{the area of the}} bile duct. Infection is acquired when people ingest raw or undercooked fish. Infection with the parasite is called <b>opisthorchiasis.</b> O. viverrini infection also predisposes the infected for cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> (caused by Opisthorchis spp.) are {{indistinguishable from}} clonorchiasis (caused by Clonorchis sinensis). About 80% of {{infected}} {{people have no}} symptoms, though they can have eosinophilia. Asymptomatic infection can occur when there are less than 1000 eggs in one gram in feces. Infection is considered heavy when there are 10,000-30,000 eggs in one gram of feces. Symptoms of heavier infections with Opisthorchis viverrini may include: diarrhoea, epigastric and upper right quadrant pain, lack of appetite (anorexia), fatigue, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) and mild fever.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Opisthorchiasis</b> is {{prevalent}} where raw cyprinid fishes are {{a staple}} of the diet. Prevalence rises with age; {{children under the age of}} 5 years are rarely infected by Opisthorchis viverrini. Males may be affected more than females. The WHO estimates that foodborne trematodiases (infection by worms or [...] "flukes", mainly Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola and Paragonimus species) affect 56 million people worldwide and 750 million are at risk of infection. Eighty million are at risk of <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> 67 million from infection with Opisthorchis viverrini in Southeast Asia and 13 million from Opisthorchis felineus in Kazakhstan, Russia including Siberia, and Ukraine. In the lower Mekong River basin, the disease is highly endemic, and more so in lowlands, with a prevalence up to 60% in some areas of northeast Thailand. However, estimates using newer polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic techniques indicate that prevalence is probably grossly underestimated. [...] In one study from the 1980s, a prevalence of over 90% was found in persons greater than 10 years old in a small village near Khon Kaen in northeast Thailand in the region known as Isaan. Sporadic cases have been reported in case reports from Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Although overall prevalence declined after initial surveys in the 1950s, increases since the 1990s in some areas seem associated with large increases in aquaculture.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{the onset}} of cholangiocarcinoma occurs with chronic <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> {{associated}} with hepatobiliary damage, inflammation, periductal fibrosis and/or cellular responses to antigens from the infecting fluke. These conditions predispose to cholangiocarcinoma, possibly through an enhanced susceptibility of DNA to damage by carcinogens. Chronic hepatobiliary damage {{is reported to be}} multi-factorial and considered to arise from a continued mechanical irritation of the epithelium by the flukes present, particularly via their suckers, metabolites and excreted/secreted antigens as well as immunopathological processes. In silico analyses using techniques of genomics and bioinformatics is unraveling information on molecular mechanisms that may be relevant to the development of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
50|$|In {{regions where}} Opisthorchis viverrini is highly endemic, the {{incidence}} of cholangiocarcinoma is unprecedented. For instance, cholangiocarcinomas represent 15% of primary liver cancer worldwide, but in Thailand's Khon Kaen region, this figure escalates to 90%, the highest recorded incidence of this cancer in the world. Of all cancers worldwide from 2002, 0.02% were cholangiocarcinoma caused by Opisthorchis viverrini. The cancer of the bile ducts caused by <b>opisthorchiasis</b> occur in the ages 25-44 years in Thailand. A few cases have appeared in later life among veterans of the Vietnam war in the United States, who consumed poorly cooked fish from streams in endemic areas near the border of Laos and Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{were raised}} also {{about such things}} as the {{relocation}} of people; the amount of virgin tropical rainforest that had to be cut down (230 km2); possible dam collapse issues; increase in diseases with waterborne vectors such as schistosomiasis, <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> malaria, and filariasis; and sediment accumulation shortening the useful lifespan of the dam. A 5-part series of Bakun dam documentaries was filmed by Chou Z Lam. The series highlighted the basic community problems faced by displaced indigenous people such as the lack of land areas for farming and hunting, lack of educational, medical, and transport facilities and also the promises not being kept by the government. This documentary series was later banned from Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) on May 2010, forcing the remaining series to YouTube.|$|E
5000|$|Freshwater snails {{are widely}} {{known to be}} hosts in the lifecycles {{of a variety of}} human and animal parasites, {{particularly}} trematodes or [...] "flukes". Some of these relations for prosobranch snails include Oncomelania in the family Pomatiopsidae as hosts of Schistosoma, and Bithynia, Parafossarulus and Amnicola as hosts of Opisthorchis. [...] Thiara and Semisulcospira may host Paragonimus. Juga plicifera may host Nanophyetus salmincola. Basommatophoran snails are even more widely infected, with many Biomphalaria (Planorbidae) serving as hosts for Schistosoma mansoni, Fasciolopsis and other parasitic groups. The tiny Bulinus snails are hosts for Schistosoma haematobium. Lymnaeid snails (Lymnaeidae) serve as hosts for Fasciola and the cerceriae causing swimmer's itch. The term “neglected tropical diseases” applies to all snail-borne infections, including schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, fasciolopsiasis, paragonimiasis, <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> clonorchiasis, and angiostrongyliasis.|$|E
50|$|Infections with O. viverrini and {{of other}} liver flukes in Asia affect {{the poor and}} poorest people. <b>Opisthorchiasis</b> has {{received}} less attention in comparison to other diseases, {{and it is a}} neglected disease in Asia. There is no approved drug for the infection; however, Swiss researchers have tested tribendimidine and achieved a 70% cure rate. Surgery and supportive treatment are complicated and generally unavailable to the endemic areas. A general trematocide praziquantel is used for the infection, but is not technically recommended. In addition to praziquantel other commonly used anthelmintics such as albendazole, artesunate, and miltefosine are found to be effective on the cercariae but not on the metacercariae. Its ability to cause cancer is worsen by the discovery that its infection is often associated with those of Helicobacter species (including H. pylori, which is primarily associated with ulcers but also may cause stomach cancers).|$|E
50|$|Generally <b>opisthorchiasis</b> due to O. viverrini is {{harmless}} {{without any}} clinical symptoms. Mild symptoms may appear such as dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea. However, under severe infection enlargement of liver (hepatomegaly) and malnutrition are observed. In rare cases, cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma can also develop. In humans,O. viverrini inhabits {{mainly in the}} bile ducts and, rarely, in the gall bladder and pancreatic duct. Heavy infection can produce problems in the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts. The bile ducts of heavily infected patients are usually dilated and indicate fibrosis. Pathological effects on the bile ducts include inflammation, epithelial desquamation, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial and adenomatous hyperplasia and periductal fibrosis. The collective effects in addition to specific parasite secretion and the host's immune reactions are attributed {{to the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma. The infection is not immediately life-threatening; cancer develops after 30-40 years, But death occurs very fast within 3-6 months of diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|O. viverrini {{remains a}} major public health problem in the Mekong Basin in Southeast Asia. It is endemic in Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vietnam and Cambodia. It is most {{prevalent}} in Thailand, {{and for this reason}} Thailand has the highest incident of opisthorchiasis-associated cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the world. About 9.6% of the total population of Thailand is estimated to be infected. It is most abundant in northern Thailand, while it occurs moderately in central Thailand. According to the five-year national survey from 2010 to 2015, the highest incidences reached up to 45.7% of the population in northern Thailand. However, there is no record of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> due to O. viverrini in southern Thailand. School children are most infected, and the infection was very high before 1984, after which there was mass treatment programme, and the prevalence sharply declined after 1994. A national survey in Lao PDR (under the project of Korea-Laos Collaborative Project for Control of Foodborne Trematode Infections in Lao PDR) between 2007 and 2011 indicates that it is the most prevalent helminth infection, amounting to 55.6% of the infection. It is not highly prevalent in Vietnam, but accurate survey is difficult because it is often co-infected with other flukes such as Haplorchis pumilio, H. taichui, and C. sinensis. It is most abundant in the northern provinces. It is least prevalent in Cambodia. A national survey between 2006 and 2011 showed that it is the second most prevalent helminth accounting for 5.7% of the total infection, after hookworm with 9.6% of the infection.|$|E
5000|$|O. viverrini {{was first}} {{described}} by a French parasitologist M.J. Poirier in 1886, who discovered the parasite in an Indian fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrus), originally from Southeast Asia that died in the Zoological Gardens attached to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He named it Distomum viverrini. American parasitologists Charles Wardell Stiles and Albert Hassall redescribed it and assigned it to the existing genus Opisthorchis (created by a French zoologist Raphaël Blanchard) in 1891. The first human specimen was {{described by a}} British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915, but without knowing the exact parasite. (He simply reported it as [...] "Notes of the occurrence of parasites presumably rare in man.") Leiper received the specimens from an Irish medical doctor Arthur Francis George Kerr, who had collected them from the postmortem examination of two prisoners at a jail in Chieng Mai, northern Thailand. In the next year Kerr himself reported from investigation of 230 male prisoners that 39 (17%) of them had the infection. Kerr initially misidentified the parasite as O. felineus, an already known human parasite, because of their close resemblance. C. Prommas also reported O. felineus in 1927 from an autopsy of a 17-year-old Thai male residing in Roi-et, northeast Thailand. It was in 1955 when Elvio H. Sadun from the U. S. Public Health Service analysed the cases of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> in Thailand and concluded that all the infections were due to O. viverrini. A systematic comparison in 1965 confirmed the differences from O. felineus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. One of {{the most}} {{important}} epidemiological problems in Sumy region — <b>opisthorchiasis.</b> Social and medical significance of the invasion is great due to high incidence of the disease, the development of severe complications. Purpose. To analyze the incidence and determine the parameters of the epidemic process of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> in Sumy region of Ukraine, to ascertain the features of its clinical course in the natural focus. Materials and Methods. Object of research — the patients with <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> medical records of in-patients (from 003 /y), reporting documentation of Sumy regional sanitary-epidemiological station. Methods of the study: clinical-anamnestic, laboratory with the use of clinical (Cobas Micros) and biochemical analyzers (Cobas Mira); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies to the pathogen; coproovoscopy by formol-ether technique, study of duodenal contents; instrumental — fibrogastroduodenoscopy, ultrasound examination, fractional study of gastricjuice. Results. The authors carried out an analysis of the epidemiological situation of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> in Ukraine and Sumy region, on the territory of which the largest natural focus of invasion is located. Morbidity of the population is 23. 0 per 100 thousand people, which exceeds the incidence in Ukraine more than 20 times. The clinical features of the disease course in endemic region were studied, there is found the prevalence of latent <b>opisthorchiasis,</b> which significantly affects the timely detection of invasion. Conclusions. The incidence of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> in Sumy region is high and significantly exceeds the average Ukrainian indices. Persistent functioning of the nidus of invasion is due to the peculiarities of the hydrological regime of the region, high prevalence of opisthorchis among cyprinids that have a significant proportion in the dietary intake of the population. Risk group consists of fishermen and their family members (72. 3 %). The main factor is the transmission is salted and dried fish (58. 7 %). Concerning clinical forms, chronic <b>opisthorchiasis</b> with latent course is mainly detected.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{studies on}} the {{relationship}} between helminth infections and atopic disorders have been conducted in (sub) tropical developing countries where exposure to multiple parasites and lifestyle can confound the relationship. We aimed to study the relationship between infection with the fish-borne helminth Opishorchis felineus and specific IgE, skin prick testing, and atopic symptoms in Western Siberia, with lifestyle and hygiene standards of a developed country. METHODS: Schoolchildren aged 7 - 11 years were sampled from one urban and two rural regions. Skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) against food and aeroallergens were measured, and data on allergic symptoms and on demographic and socioeconomic factors were collected by questionnaire. Diagnosis of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> was based on PCR performed on stool samples. RESULTS: Of the 732 children included, 34. 9 % had <b>opisthorchiasis.</b> The sensitization to any allergen when estimated by positive SPT was 12. 8 %, while much higher, 24. 0 %, when measured by sIgE. Atopic symptoms in the past year (flexural eczema and/or rhinoconjunctivitis) were reported in 12. 4 % of the children. SPT was positively related to flexural eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis, but not to wheezing. <b>Opisthorchiasis</b> showed association with lower SPT response, as well as borderline association with low IgE reactivity to any allergen. However, the effect of <b>opisthorchiasis</b> on SPT response was not mediated by IgE, suggesting that <b>opisthorchiasis</b> influences SPT response through another mechanism. <b>Opisthorchiasis</b> also showed borderline association with lower atopic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There is a negative association between a chronic helminth infection and skin prick test reactivity even in a developed country...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{compositions}} of homogenized metacercaria {{and adult}} Opisthorchis viverrini {{were characterized by}} sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The two different stages of O. viverrini parasite contained several protein components with very similar mobilities on SDS-PAGE gel. The reaction in immunoblots of sera from patients with <b>opisthorchiasis</b> demonstrated antibodies against heterogeneous protein components of metacercariae and adult O. viverrini parasites. Only the components of metacercariae with molecular weights of 190 - 200 kD, 132 kD and 107 kD reacted specifically with <b>opisthorchiasis</b> sera. This characteristic reaction pattern was not observed in any control sera of normal subjects or those infected with other parasites. Identical reactions were however also recognized in the sera of experimental infected hamsters with metacercariae, but did not occur with adult worm as the antigen for the immunoblotting reaction. This may indicate that these metacercariae-associated protein components have potential diagnostic value for <b>opisthorchiasis...</b>|$|E
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study on hepatobiliary abnormalities in <b>opisthorchiasis</b> {{was performed in}} 8936 males and females aged from 20 to 60 years from 90 villages of Khon Kaen province, Northeast Thailand.
