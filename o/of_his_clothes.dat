Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E

Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return.

After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8.

5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger {{helicopter}} {{that had}} been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading waterbuckets from the dam {{at the time of}} the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.|$|E
60|$|With a swift {{disclosing}} gesture he gave Ossipon {{a glimpse}} of an india-rubber tube, resembling a slender brown worm, issuing from the armhole <b>of</b> <b>his</b> waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket. <b>His</b> <b>clothes,</b> <b>of</b> a nondescript brown mixture, were threadbare and marked with stains, dusty in the folds, with ragged button-holes. “The detonator is partly mechanical, partly chemical,” he explained, with casual condescension.|$|R

25|$|Other {{images of}} despair and madness fill the scene: a lunatic cavorts {{in the street}} beating himself {{over the head with}} a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike—the dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house {{screaming}} in horror; a barber has taken his own life in the dilapidated attic of his barber-shop, ruined because nobody can afford a haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket. An ex-soldier, he has pawned most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E

500|$|After Ivan Vladislav's {{death in}} February 1018, Diogenes {{was charged with}} mopping up the last {{remaining}} centres of Bulgarian resistance. He took Sirmium and was named its commander (archon); his authority extended over the vassal Serbian statelets of Raška. His title was possibly that of [...] "strategos of Serbia" [...] (Greek: στρατηγός Σερβίας), which is attested in a seal attributed to him. Diogenes was ordered by Basil II to subdue Sermon, the ruler of Sirmium, to consolidate Byzantine control of the northern Balkans. Consequently, Diogenes invited Sermon to {{a meeting at the}} estuary of the river Sava in the Danube, where each would only be accompanied by three attendants. Diogenes had hidden his sword in the folds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> and struck Sermon down. He then marched his army into Sirmium, taking possession of the town. Sermon's wife was sent as a captive to Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed {{and his mouth}} is broad and down-turned, yet his {{features}} are those of a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E

[...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E

500|$|A {{group of}} white vigilantes, {{who had become}} a mob by this time, seized Sam Carter, a local {{blacksmith}} and teamster who worked in a turpentine still. They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner.

To the surprise of many witnesses, someone fatally shot Carter in the face. The group hung Carter's mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area. Some in the mob took souvenirs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes.</b> Survivors suggest that John Bradley fled to Rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier, a fellow veteran and Mason.

She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girls—her love has a limit!

500|$|During {{the last}} story arc from the manga, the story takes a darker tone than those [...] from other shōnen series {{published}} by Shueisha. As {{the series was}} aimed at teenagers, Watsuki made Yahiko the main character during the time when Kenshin thought that Kamiya Kaoru was dead; his role was {{to serve as the}} identifying character for readers. However, the author found this hard to do, as the more time Kenshin was unwilling to continue to live, the worse Yahiko felt, leaving Watsuki a more negative feeling concerning the story. By the end of the series as Yahiko becomes a teenager, Watsuki had redesigned his appearance. He wanted [...] Yahiko to impress manga readers [...] so that he [...] could [...] be a protagonist for a possible [...] series sequel. He said this goal influenced his design of Yahiko, with Kenshin's physical appearance as well as Sanosuke's personality. He added Sanosuke's kanji of [...] to the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> and was pleased that various readers recognized it. Although he suggested {{he was not going to}} make a sequel, he said the main characters would be Yahiko, Sanjō Tsubame and Tsukayama Yutarō. Watsuki thought about writing a story in which Yahiko and Tsubame would have a son, Myōjin Shinya, who would become a skilled swordsman.|$|E
