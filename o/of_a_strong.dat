5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage {{with the help of the}} alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E
5|$|After {{being forced}} out of his Yildirim Army Group {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning of}} 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias to Samakh to organise the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> rearguard at Samakh. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered to move to Beisan from Afulah at 08:30 on 24 September and was subsequently ordered at 13:45 to advance to capture Samakh. This town was strategically important to both sides as it controlled a direct road to Damascus. On 25 September, the 11th Light Horse Regiment supported by part of the 12th Light Horse Regiment charged in the pre-dawn while the German and Australian machine–gunners conducted a firefight. After an hour-long battle the light horse forced the garrison to surrender, capturing 350 prisoners at the station and in the town, suffering 14 killed and 29 wounded.|$|E

5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> ocean current that swung Missouri {{too far to the}} right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|Crossing Madagascar {{for a third}} time, Elita closely {{followed}} the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February3. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed under the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Dolores {{continued}} to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores {{became the first}} hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity. It dissipated on July 12. The hurricane was {{not a threat to}} any land.|$|E
5|$|Early on September9, Luis turned {{towards the}} north and {{weakened}} to a Category2 hurricane, with winds of 110mph (165km/h). Several hours later, the hurricane made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 200mi (320km) west of the island. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> trough located to the northwest of Luis. During the afternoon of September10, Hurricane Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at an unusually high latitude.|$|E

5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction around the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.
