30|$|Reducing {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{is crucial to}} the {{extension}} of network lifetime. The SHPER and SHEAR protocols are evaluated {{in terms of the number}} <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required in forwarding the sensed information from a source node to the BS. As the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> is proportional to the number of hops traversed on the forwarding path in the data communication phase, the effectiveness of an underlying path selection scheme is determined by the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> since a path consisting of fewer hops will induce fewer onward transmissions.|$|R
30|$|Also on a {{reliable}} network, revised LNC, IRR, and BCSD start with {{almost the same}} number <b>of</b> required <b>transmissions</b> to deliver all the packets. When the loss probability increases, the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> with the revised LNC increases about 56 % when the loss probability reaches 20 %. Both NC with IRR and NC with BCSD show an important saving in the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> compared to the revised LNC. With a loss probability of 20 %, NC with BCSD represent a saving of 22 % in the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> over the revised LNC. IRR lightly increases the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> compared to BCSD.|$|R
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes {{infected}} with T. cruzi by feeding {{on the blood}} of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> from mother to child with IVF {{is no different from}} the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|Other modes <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> include organ transplantation, through breast milk, and by {{accidental}} laboratory exposure.

5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} mode <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV is through {{sexual contact with}} an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load.

5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of IDNC for {{scalable}} video with multiple layers, the most related works to ours are [39, 40]. In [39], the authors considered that a set of packets forming the base layer has higher priority compared to another set of packets forming the enhancement layers. However, the authors aimed {{to reduce the number}} <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering all the packets instead of reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering the high priority packets. The coding decisions in [39] also searched for the existence of a special IDNC packet that can simultaneously reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering the high priority packets and the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering all the packets. On the other hand, the authors in [40] discussed the hierarchical order of video layers with motivating examples and proposed a heuristic packet selection algorithm. The IDNC algorithm in [40] aimed to balance between the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering the base layer and the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> required for delivering all video layers. Both works in [39, 40] ignored the hard deadline and did not strictly prioritize to deliver the base layer packets before the deadline. However, for real-time scalable video transmission, addressing the hard deadline for the base layer packets is essential as all other packets depend on the base layer packets.|$|R
5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} how to {{hide the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> information within the RF environment created by packet-based broadband wireless (infrastructure) networks, like LTE. The desire {{to hide the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> information has existed since antiquity; including concealing the very existence <b>of</b> <b>transmissions,</b> since exposing the presence <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> may expose {{the location of the}} sender or an increase in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> may portend the occurrence of an event. To achieve high data rates current infrastructure networks typically use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) along with protocols that adapt to the environment, e. g., adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ), and opportunistic scheduling. It is expected that future systems will continue to use these methods in addition to advanced interference managemen...|$|R

Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} result that constructing codewords over GF(2) to minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> for a single-hop wireless multicasting is an NP-complete problem. Linearly independent codewords can be constructed in polynomial time for all the n clients, known as maximum distance separable (MDS) code, when the finite field size q is larger {{than or equal to}} the number of clients, q≥ n. In this paper we quantify the exact minimum number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> for a multicast network using erasure code when q= 2 and n= 3, such that q<n.
