5000|$|The {{main problem}} with the [...] "string inverter" [...] {{approach}} is the string of panels acts {{as if it were}} a single larger panel with a max current rating equivalent to the poorest performer in the string. For example, if one panel in a string has 5% higher resistance due to a minor manufacturing defect, the entire string suffers a 5% performance loss. This situation is dynamic. If a panel is shaded its output drops dramatically, affecting the output of the string, even if the other panels are not shaded. Even slight changes in orientation can cause <b>output</b> <b>loss</b> in this fashion. In the industry, this is known as the [...] "Christmas-lights effect", referring to the way an entire string of series-strung Christmas tree lights will fail if a single bulb fails. However, this effect is not entirely accurate and ignores the complex interaction between modern string inverter maximum power point tracking and even module bypass diodes. Shade studies by major micro inverter and DC optimizer companies show small yearly gains in light, medium and heavy shaded conditions- 2%, 5% and 8% respectively- over an older string inverter.|$|E

The cumulative <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> incurred during crisis periods are found to be large, roughly 15 %- 20 % of annual GDP, on average. In contrast to previous research, it is also found that <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> incurred during crises in developed countries are as high, or higher, on average, than those in emerging market economies. Moreover, <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> during crisis periods in developed countries also appear to be significantly larger - 10 %- 15 % - than in neighbouring countries that did not at the time experience severe banking problems. In emerging market economies, by contrast, banking crises appear to be costly only when accompanied by a currency crisis. These results seem robust to allowing for macroeconomic conditions at the outset of crisis - in particular low and declining output growth - that have also contributed to future <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> during episodes. ...|$|R

Although the Malaysian experience during the Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 made many researchers and policy makers interested in {{the effectiveness of a}} policy restricting cross-border financial transactions to minimize the output cost, this association has not been exposed to a thorough empirical investigation. The probit analysis in this paper shows that the higher the level of financial openness is, the less likely countries are to experience a currency crisis among industrialized and less developed countries. It is found that a higher level of financial openness prior to a crisis helps to reduce <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> for industrialized countries, but not for less developed or emerging market countries. It is also shown that the duration of post-crisis output contraction can be shorter when an industrialized country has a high level of financial openness, but for the group of EMGs the duration of output contraction can be lengthened if a country has more open capital accounts. However, once the country encounters a currency crisis, the effect of capital account openness differs depending on the level of development. The post-crisis level of financial openness helps industrialized countries to reduce the magnitude of <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> while it increases post-crisis <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> for emerging market and less developed countries. A higher rate of financial liberalization is also found to be detrimental to less developed countries. When the dynamics of output gaps after a crisis are investigated, it is found that the negative effect of a higher level of capital account openness lasts {{for at least three years}} for emerging market countries. In general, I have found that institutional development such as corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality, rather than the level of openness in financial markets, is important in lowering the size of post-crisis <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> for the groups of less developed or emerging market countries.
