5000|$|The Parisians, while denying {{adoption}} of the backwards Russian troupe, had distinct Russian influence in their theater. “Despite Clustine’s protestations, several features of the Opera’s post-1909 ballets, along with its institutional conventions and balletic policy, appeared to betray a Russian influence.” The stigma of Russian brutality and force was applied even in Paris. While their style was not only being accepted in Paris, but implemented in Paris theaters, the Ballets Russes were still considered dangerous, even in the theatre of performing art. “The Ballets Russes, at base, became a metaphor for invasion, an eternal force that could engulf and control, could penetrate the membrane of French society, culture and even art itself.” [...] The embracing of Russian ballet in the Paris society became a point of contention and French nationalism collided with Russian determination. Questions arose about the Russian intention in the Paris theaters under the title “cultural politics” including “the delimitation of boundaries, the preservation of identity {{and the nature of}} relational engagements.” [...] Russia was incapable of simply bringing Russian culture to the West, but created a paranoia of intentions wherever they went. In the beginning, the relationship between Russia and France through the arts was a testimony to their political allegiances. “French critics acknowledged a shared choreographic heritage: French ballet had migrated to Russia in the nineteenth century, only to return, decades later, under the guise of the Ballets Russes. The company, then, moored in a history that intertwined both nations, not only contributed to a cultural programme of exchange. The Ballets Russes were a testament to Franco-Russian cooperation, goodwill and support; they represented ‘un nouveau resserrement de l’alliance’ (a further strengthening of the alliance).” [...] However, the relationship made a negative turn when duplicity amongst the alliance arose. While Russia continued to borrow money from the French banks, “the Russians no longer interested in supporting French culture and colonial politics.” This duplicity gave fuel for the paranoia and lack of trust we see in the relationship concerning the arts. The Parisian press spoke of the Ballets Russes in terms of both “enchantement’, ‘bouleversement’ and ‘fantaisie’. Yet they also invoked metaphors of invasion, describing the company’s Parisian presence in terms of ‘assaut’ (onslaught) and ‘conquete’ (conquest).” [...] The dual-faceted relationship can be seen in this expression of both enrapture and contention. One French journalist, Maurice Lefevre, called on his fellow Parisians to see the reality of the Russian invasion as though it was an infestation, “We need to do some soul-searching and ask whether <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> not about to become our masters.” [...] To imply that Russia was about to take over France through performing arts seems to be irrational, but evidence would suggest the fears were real among those in Paris.|$|E

40|$|The tsam {{dance in}} this video was {{performed}} in celebration of the 10 th anniversary of {{the establishment of the}} Central Temple in Elista. Since 1917 tsam was performed only twice in Kalmykia, and this video captures one such rare occasion. The tsam dancers are Tibetan monks from the Dzongkar Choede Monastery in India. The ceremony is opened by the Head Lama of Kalmykia, Telo Tulku Rinpoche. The head of the Republic of Kalmykia, Alexey Orlov, a Kalmyk MP in Russian Duma, Marina Mukabenova, and the abbot of the Dzongkar Choede Monastery, Tubden Tsering, also gave celebratory speeches. Telo Tulku Rinpoche's speech: On the invitation of the Central Temple 28 monks from the Dzongkar Choede Monastery arrived in Kalmykia to perform this ceremony. This ritual is not a mere theatrical performance but a religious ritual. Today many people have gathered here, and I wish you all to live in peace and understanding. We have guests here today who are scholars in Buddhism. We are celebrating this anniversary with pride. Today the Central Temple is the biggest temple in Europe. We know that thanks to the Temple we can improve our knowledge of Buddhism. Our Temple carries out educational work among the laity. Today among <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>are</b> people from other Buddhist republics, such as Buryatia and Tuva. We can be beneficial to each other and exchange our experiences. Today I would like to thank all people of Kalmykia {{from the bottom of my}} heart for your faith and support. Thank you very much. I want again to thank the head of Kalmykia, Alexey Orlov, as well as the previous head of Kalmykia, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. My gratitude also goes towards our sponsors and volunteers who help the Central Temple. I wish all happiness, health, peace, and prosperity. I will always pray for all of you. Alexey Orlov’s speech: I would like to congratulate all the guests and people who are present here for the anniversary of the Central Temple. 11 years ago the Dalai Lama consecrated this land for the construction of a temple. The Temple was built within a year. The Temple has become a scientific center and a center for the unity of religions. In this building people can learn about Buddhism. Our people have suffered a lot. Our people managed to keep their ethnic identity, which is what our Buddhist teachers teach us. The ceremony of tsam reflects the historical uniqueness of the Kalmyk people. I hope that this celebration will serve as an incarnation of unity, and cultural and religious values. Marina Mukabenova’s speech: I congratulate you on the anniversary. The Central Temple organizes free Kalmyk language courses. Thanks to our Rinpoche our pilgrims go to India for the Dalai Lama's teachings. The Temple also carries out work to strengthen inter-religious harmony. We are proud that our Head Lama has been appointed permanent representative of the Dalai Lama XIV in Russia and in the countries of CIS. Rinpoche and the workers of the Temple, please accept the words of my deep gratitude for your work and for your wish to help all living beings. Tubden Tsering: On behalf of all the monks of the Dzongkar Choede Monastery I would like to greet all the people present here, the head of Kalmykia and all the guests. I would like to briefly tell you about the history of our monastery and the ceremony of tsam. The monastery initially belonged to the Sakya school of Buddhism. It was built in 1277. In 1651 the Dalai Lama V, seeing a great demand, changed the monastery from the tradition of Sakya to that of Gelug. (Following China’s annexation of Tibet) representative of the monastery fled to Nepal, and from there the monastery was re-built in the south of India in 1972. Traditionally, the monastery performed tantric rituals and practices. On the instructions of the Dalai Lama XIV, the monastery began to teach higher philosophy of Buddhism to its monks. Now about the origin of the tradition of ritual dances. In 1490 a great yoga practitioner Chopel Sangpo saw the face of deity Yamantaka. In accordance with this vision, the yoga practitioner established a tradition of religious dances called tsam. At that time our monastery was situated in a borderland between India and Nepal. This region was rife with conflicts. In order to eradicate these border conflicts, as well as hunger, draught, illnesses and other obstacles, tsam dances came to be performed on the 29 th day of the 12 th month according to the lunar calendar. This dance ceremony is performed together with a ritual to ‘erect the iron palace of Torgyak’. Today the monks will perform this dance to remove obstacles and for peace in the world and for prosperity in Kalmykia. I would like to remind you all that this is not a show but a religious ceremony. It would be good if all people here create a good motivation together with us. On behalf of the monastery I would like to offer hadag scarfs to the Head of Kalmykia and the Head Lama of Kalmykia as well. I would also like to wish prosperity in Russia and health to both Kalmyk and Tibetan peoples. Arcadi...|$|E
