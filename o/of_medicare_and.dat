5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

By 1983, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) replaced pay for service reimbursements to hospitals for Medicare patients.|$|E

25|$|Homelessness {{has been}} a chronic and {{controversial}} problem for San Francisco since the early 1970s when many mentally ill patients were deinstitutionalized, due to changes which began during the 1960s with the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid. The homeless population {{is estimated to be}} 13,500 with 6,500 living on the streets. The city is believed to have the highest number of homeless inhabitants per capita of any major U.S. city. Rates of reported violent and property crimes for 2009 (736 and 4,262 incidents per 100,000 residents, respectively) are slightly lower than for similarly sized U.S. cities.|$|E

25|$|In that setting, he says, {{providers}} {{almost always}} charged minimal fees for services {{in order to}} improve the chance of being paid. He argues that the emergence of government as a payer for healthcare services in the form <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid, along with government policies of the 1970s that led to the expansion of private insurance to cover routine medical services in addition to hospitalization and emergency care, and which required most employers to provide health insurance for their employees, interfered with the traditional physician-patient relationship. The incentive for healthcare providers and patients to keep costs as low as possible was lost. He says that now providers always charge the maximal fees for services, since the government or insurance company can be counted on to pay the bills.|$|E
25|$|The act, as {{currently}} structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient hospital service payments and ambulatory care payments {{that would otherwise}} undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the CBO. Gail Wilensky, a deputy assistant to President Bush Snr advising him on health and welfare issues from 1992–1993 and previously a director <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid has expressed concern that this might affect seniors {{access to health care}} if the changes are made too quickly, while other activists such as Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund argue that Medicare Advantage plans cost the taxpayer $1,000 per policyholder more than if the person had been insured through traditional fee for services.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two ways}} for {{providers}} to be reimbursed in Medicare. “Participating” providers accept [...] "assignment," [...] {{which means that they}} accept Medicare’s approved rate for their services as payment (typically 80% from Medicare and 20% from the beneficiary). Some non participating doctors do not take assignment, but they also treat Medicare enrollees and are authorized to balance bill no more than a small fixed amount above Medicare’s approved rate. A minority of doctors are [...] "private contractors," [...] which means they opt out <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> refuse to accept Medicare payments altogether.

2500|$|The 2010 Massachusetts Senate special {{election}} victory of Scott Brown seriously imperiled {{the prospects of}} a health care reform bill, as Democrats lost their 60-seat Senate super-majority. The White House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi engaged in an extensive campaign to convince both centrists and liberals in the House to pass the Senate's health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, after Obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for elective abortion services, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill, which had passed the Senate in December 2009, did not receive a single Republican vote in either house. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the PPACA into law. The New York Times described the PPACA as [...] "the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades," [...] while the Washington Post noted {{that it was the}} biggest expansion of health insurance coverage since the creation <b>of</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid in 1965.
