40|$|Modular {{approach}} to application software development has become significantly popular among the enterprises. However, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) -based applications represent the majority <b>of</b> modular <b>application</b> software. The major concerns of developers <b>of</b> these <b>applications</b> are oriented around {{the reliability and}} fault-free implementation, which necessitate proper testing <b>of</b> the <b>application.</b> Testing <b>of</b> SOA-based <b>application</b> plays {{a critical role in}} ensuring a successful deployment <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> Testing strategies <b>of</b> such <b>applications</b> like unit testing, integration testing and system testing may somehow resemble to that <b>of</b> traditional <b>application</b> software. However, regression testing <b>of</b> SOA-based <b>applications,</b> which can be conducted during the maintenance phase, may present several challenges. To begin with, in this research paper, we attempt to explore a road map to regression testing <b>of</b> SOA-based <b>applications...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{clustering}} {{method that}} combined density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise with mathematical morphology clustering is proposed {{to adapt to}} the features of driver’s fixation such as points’ dispersion and fixation regions’ irregularity and solve the problems of conventional density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise method’s large influence by parameters and mathematical morphology clustering’s needs of much manual intervention. Drivers’ fixation data were collected by Smart Eye Pro 5. 7 eye tracking system, and the data were processed and clustered using conventional clustering methods and density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method. The results show that the method proposed in this article takes into account the advantages of density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise and mathematical morphology clustering to cluster irregular regions and makes up for defects of conventional clustering methods. It is verified that density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method is better than the conventional hierarchical clustering method and density-based spatial clustering <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with noise method in driver’s fixation points clustering and can improve the quality of driver’s fixation region division...|$|R
