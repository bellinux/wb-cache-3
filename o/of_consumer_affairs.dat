5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
25|$|Fossella's {{political}} career began in April 1994, {{when he won}} a special election to the New York City Council, representing Staten Island's South Shore and Mid-Island section.

In 2015, the CEOs made a public admission of this happening in New York after a New York City Department <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> investigation.|$|E

25|$|In November 2003, {{a special}} {{ceremony}} {{was held at}} Smith's grave site to display a new 18-foot-tall flagpole and stone bench nearby. Smith's son, Cornelius Cole Smith, Jr., was in attendance. Initially started by 16-year-old Michael Emett for an Eagle Scout project, {{this was the first}} of a planned restoration campaign for the graves of Riverside's military veterans and town founders. The story was covered by The Press-Enterprise and encouraged community leaders to raise money for an endowment to provide for the upkeep of older rundown areas of the cemetery that are not watered or maintained. A few years before, the California Department <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> ordered that sprinklers in the historic section be shut off because it lacked an endowment to pay for the water.|$|E
25|$|Heinze's first book, Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity, was {{published}} in 1990. It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American consumer culture on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.” The Journal <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1973 {{election}} Gjems-Onstad {{advocated a}} restrictive immigration policy {{in an interview}} with Morgenbladet. After being elected to parliament, he was the sole member of the Finance Committee to oppose agreements of raising fuel taxes in 1973. He proposed steep budget cuts in 1974, notably in press support and in the Office of the Prime Minister. He proposed to abolish the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> and Administration, as well as 22 laws the same year. Gjems-Onstad also wanted to abolish conscription. In 1975 he criticised parliament for violating the Norwegian Constitution by regularly holding session with {{less than half of the}} representatives present. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli in turn claimed that Gjems-Onstad [...] "undermined democracy" [...] because he was present and spoke in parliament too much.|$|E

[...] On the same day that New Jersey State Assemblymen Gary Schaer and Wayne DeAngelo called for an inquiry, New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram also said that her office and the New Jersey Division <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> would investigate the sale of Springsteen concert tickets amidst a number of complaints. [...] As the matter gained national attention, it became what The Washington Post described as a [...] "public relations nightmare" [...] for Ticketmaster. [...] On February 5, Ticketmaster issued an [...] "open letter of apology" [...] to Springsteen and his fans, saying that it would no longer link to TicketsNow from Ticketmaster during high-demand sales and promising it would refund customers who inadvertently bought secondary market tickets. [...] Pascrell, whose office received over 1,000 complaints on the matter, and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal also used the sales tales to indicate concern with the possible merger of Ticketmaster with Live Nation. [...] Springsteen also voiced his objection to the merger, and his comments also gained national attention.|$|E

500|$|From 1970 to 1973, much {{legislation}} {{passed through the}} South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created, censorship was liberalised, seat belts were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 {{and the age of}} majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved. Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner's disregard for Dunstan's orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired. The dress code for the Parliament was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory, and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits. Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted [...] "the sexiest political leader in Australia" [...] by Woman's Day in 1975, and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains iconic.|$|E

2500|$|Byrne {{was born}} Jane Margaret Burke on May 24, 1933 at John B. Murphy Hospital in the Lake View {{neighborhood}} {{on the north}} side of Chicago, Illinois to Katherine Marie Burke (née Nolan), a stay at home wife and Edward Patrick Burke, vice president of Inland Steel. Raised on the city's north side, Byrne graduated from Saint Scholastica High School and attended St. Mary of the Woods for her freshman year of college. Byrne later transferred to Barat College, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and biology in 1965. Byrne entered politics to volunteer in John F. Kennedy's campaign for president in 1960. During that campaign she first met then Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. After meeting Daley, he appointed her to several positions beginning in 1964 with a job in the city's Head Start program. In June 1965, she was promoted and worked with the Chicago Committee of Urban Opportunity. In 1968, Byrne was appointed head of the City of Chicago's consumer affairs department. In 1972, Byrne served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and chairperson of the DNC resolutions committee in 1973. Byrne was appointed co–chairperson of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee by Daley, despite the rejection by the majority of Democratic leaders in 1975. The committee ousted Byrne shortly after Daley's death in late 1976. Shortly thereafter, Bryne accused the newly appointed mayor Michael Bilandic of being unfair to citizens of the city by placing a 12% increase on cab–fare which Byrne felt was the result of a [...] "backroom deal". Byrne was fired from her post of head <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>affairs</b> by Bilandic shortly after he was made aware of her charges against him in April 1977.|$|E
