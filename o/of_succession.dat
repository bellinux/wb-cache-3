5|$|The Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has {{included}} marriages between royal relatives, but marriages between dynasts and foreigners, including foreign royals, are rare.

5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while {{much of the rest of}} the Khitan elite supported the traditional method <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for an individual to renounce his or her right <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E

5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth {{generated}} public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E

5|$|From May 1684, the King's illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, {{lived in}} the Netherlands, where he was fêted by William and Mary. Monmouth {{was viewed as a}} rival to the Duke of York, and as a {{potential}} Protestant heir who could supplant James in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> William, however, did not consider him a viable alternative and correctly assumed that Monmouth had insufficient support.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E
