25|$|The US {{interest}} rates were also affected by France's decision {{to raise their}} {{interest rates}} to attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the exchange rate to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into francs to buy more French assets, the demand for the U.S. dollar fell, and the exchange rate increased. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> US could do {{to get back into}} equilibrium was increase interest rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{mediation}} in Marxism is {{also referred to}} as the problem of determination, or namely how social actors navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker’s body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction that becomes a commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker’s sole means of subsistence. The worker must get as much value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive.|$|E
25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach Laurel Hill Valley until 1886. At this time the area {{was one of the}} last in Pennsylvania that had not been touched by the lumbermen. The {{mountains}} were stripped of the old-growth forests of hemlock and white pine. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts of the many coal mines throughout southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The bark of the hemlock tree was used as a source of tannin at the tanneries of the area. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> lumbermen left behind was the treetops. These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Laurel Hill area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow in the wake of the wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found.|$|E

25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach the Great Trough Creek area until 1910. At this time the area was a {{thriving}} second growth forest that had grown {{in place of the}} forests that were stripped during the industrial era. The mountains were stripped by the lumbering operation of Caprio and Grieco who had built a railroad into the area and built a sawmill at Paradise Furnace. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts at the Broad Top Coal and Mineral Company mines in Jacobs, Pennsylvania.

Not only were Chirac's comments considered unsportsmanlike where the normal etiquette is not to criticize rival cities, there were two IOC members from Finland who would vote in the final ballot.

500|$|Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for {{not being}} of a fickle disposition. Rebutting {{historian}} Theopompus, the biographer insists that for [...] "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose". On the other hand, Polybius, a Greek historian of the Mediterranean world, was highly critical of Demosthenes's policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. [...] "And {{had it not been}} for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes".|$|E

500|$|The scene {{takes place}} in Hog Lane, part of the slum {{district}} of St Giles with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the background. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows Huguenots leaving the French Church {{in what is now}} Soho. The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in the silk trade; and the French Church was their first place of worship. Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group {{on the other side of}} the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> two sides have in common.

[...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars.
