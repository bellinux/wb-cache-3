60|$|But {{even this}} piece of work is a jest to the perpetration of the bough at the {{left-hand}} upper corner of the picture opposite to it,--the View near Albano. This latter is a representation of an <b>ornamental</b> <b>group</b> of elephants' tusks, with feathers tied {{to the ends of}} them. Not the wildest imagination could ever conjure up in it the remotest resemblance to the bough of a tree. It might be the claws of a witch--the talons of an eagle--the horns of a fiend; but it is a full assemblage of every conceivable falsehood which can be told respecting foliage--a piece of work so barbarous in every way, that one glance at it ought to prove the complete charlatanism and trickery of the whole system of the old landscape painters. For I will depart for once from my usual plan, of abstaining from all assertion of a thing's being beautiful or otherwise; I will say here, at once, that such drawing as this is as ugly as it is childish, and as painful as it is false; and that the man who could tolerate, much more, who could deliberately set down such a thing on his canvas, had neither eye nor feeling for one single attribute or excellence of God's works. He might have drawn the other stem in excusable ignorance, or under some false impression of being able to improve upon nature; but this is conclusive and unpardonable. Again, take the stem of the chief tree in Claude's Narcissus. It is a very faithful portrait of a large boa-constrictor, with a handsome tail; the kind of trunk which young ladies at fashionable boarding-schools represent with nosegays at the top of them, by way of forest scenery.|$|E

Marte kod Trogira; najprije početkom 20. stoljeća u vrijeme prvih iskopavanja i potom u revizijskim nastojanjima krajem lO-tih godina istoga stoljeća. Otim spomenicima do sada je više puta pisano, a povodi za to bili su različiti. Uočljiva su oprečna mišljenja opitanju njihove stilske i vremenske pripadnosti. Udosadašnjim prijedlozima kreću se vrlo široko, od 6. do 12. stoljeća, dakle, od kasnoantičkoga do ranoromaničkoga razdoblja. Našim pokušajem nastoji se osnažiti pretpostavka da je u ovom slučaju riječ o ranosrednjovjekovrtim skulpturama iz kraja 8. ili samog početka 9. stoljeća. The paper {{deals with}} a group of unskilfully cut relieves, {{excavated}} on two occasions (in the early 20 th ct., and during the revising excavations in the 1970 s) among the ruins of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church (Sv. Marta) near Trogir, that made part of the Croatian rulers 2 ̆ 7 court in the early Middle Ages (villa Biaci, as referred to by the historic sources, was built on top of the remains of a Roman villa rustica). The relieves were made at various parts of the altar rail (plutei, pilasters, capitals, beams and arched gables) and at a lintel. The main decoration, appearing in various combinations at almost all the fragments, are sequences of concentric circles, single-and multi-switch laces made into braids, with a dot bulge or a small cross in the middle, and double-switch curfs with trefoil ending and a cross in the middle. The dominating motives at the plutei are the large multi-switch crosses with stylised palmettes below and rosettas ofvarious forms above their horizontal arms. These artefacts have been written about several times,Jor various reasons. There are confronting opinions about their stylistic and chronological affiliation. In the present-day proposals, they range very widely,from the 6 th to the 12 th centuries, thus,from the late-classical to the early-Romanesque periods. Here it is attempted to enforce the theses on these being early-medieval seulptures o ft he late (fh or {{the very beginning of the}} 9 th century. In a review of all the opinions presented on the tapie by abut a dozen oj authors since 1930, particularly emphasized are the efforts ojLj. Karaman, B. Gabričević, Ž. Rapanić and T. Burić. In 1930, Lj. Karaman presented his thesis on the seulptures originating from the 12 th century, and indicating a rebuilding of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church (with the change of its dedication to St. John) performed, according to a 1197 written source, by the local peasants who, at the time, already formed a settlement there. He also deems that they make clear and unique evidencesproving that the interlaced sculptural decoration in the then rural Croatia lasted much longer then in towns, the latterfollowing development of the arts in the neighbouring Italy In 1956, B. Gabričević analysed similar ornaments at the then discovered pluteum of Gala, in the Sinj Field. He does not present a precise dating, however, he was the first to assume that the pluteum, together with the similarly decorated fragments ofBijaći to which he compared it, should be dated to the centuries between the last classical period and the times prior to the early-medieval interlaced art. In 1987, Ž. Rapanić discussed generally the art of the preRomanesque epoque in Dalmatia. Searchingfor its roots in the previous centuries, he assumed that the Jragments oj the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church, just like the similar Dalmatian artefacts, belonged to the second half of the 7 th century. In 1993, T. Burić assumed, while taking into account casual conclusions made by other authors, that these seulptures, together with several other examples similar by style, oj Trogir, Solin (Gradina and Otok) and the Sinj Field (Trilj and Gala), and of Crkvina in Biskupija near Knin, make a unique cultural circle. He deems this regional group of ornaments, the common characteristic of which is unskilful stone cutting and peculiar artistic expression, should be dated after the "classic" paleo-Christian sculpture, and certainly before the pre-Romanesque one. He assumes that the fragments belong to the first half of the 7 th century, and make products ofthe "last stone-cutters of Salona/ who worked immediately before moving ofthe then ecclesiastical centre from Salona to Split. He deems, thus, that this group of artefacts is, in general, a closer regionalfeature, territorially limited to the diocese of Salona. In the results ofthe past analyses ofthe St. Martha relieves, this paper emphasizes as a common characteristic the lack ofskill and proper training of their authors, as well as the stylistically defined group of similar artefacts discovered in the past at several of the already mentioned sites in Dalmatia. These are to be added some further artefacts from the Šuplja crkva and Gradina ofSolin and, as pointed out, some from the farther Dalmatian hinterland, from the present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina (sculptures from the churches ofZenica and Dabravina). While discussing the sty!istic and stonecutting characteristics of all these seulptures, particularly those of the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church, particular attention is paid to the dominant decorative motives: the multi-switch crosses and braids, and curls with trefoil and cross ornaments in the middle. The author turns attention to their numerous analogies with stylistically similar artefacts ofthe Istrian and the Apennine peninsulas, particularly among the rnstic relieves dated to the 82 ̆ 7 -h and the very beginning ofthe !Jh centuries. Attention is also turned to the fact that, at the same time at the Apennine Peninsula, similar ornaments were also cut at relieves that made the very top of the contemporary art. Among several such examples, particular attention is paid to the sarcophagus of Buggi, of the ffh century, and very similar ornaments decorating the lateral sides ofthe cathedras ofCividale and Sesto al Reghena, of the second half of the ffh century, as well as those of the ciborium of St. Eleucadia in the church of S. Apolinare in Classe in Ravenna, made between the years 806 and 810. These better cut Italian sculptures are finely comparable to two very Similarly decorated ones in Dalmatia: the fragment of the altar ciborium of Trogir and the very finely decorated pluteum of the Zadar cathedral. The fact that in the ffh century similar motives were being cut at both rustic relieves and those ofhigh stonecutting quality simultaneously at both the East-Adriatic coast and its hinterland as well as in Italy, brings into doubt the previously presented conclUSions, that the Dalmatian rnstic sculptures make later and unskilful products of the stonecutting workshops that worked follOWing the models of those in urban centres. However, it appears acceptable the thesis that the Dalmatian 82 ̆ 7 -h centU 1 Y sculpture, in its entire complexity, makes a complete image ofthe contemporary events in the European art, especially in the Italian one. Very like and, probably, contemporary ornamental motives are, thus, produced in both analysed areas -Dalmatia and Italy. The fact that in Dalmatia they are made in a somewhat different stonecutting treatment may indicate their regional production, however, most probably the same models and schemes being followed in both communities. The same <b>ornamental</b> <b>group</b> ofsculptures found in the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church is to be added also the fragment of a decorated architrave with remains of the inscription reading CA [...] . IUP[anus (-ana?) and [. [...] ChrORATORV(m) ET [...] Since this fragment, too, certainly belongs to the end ofthe [fh or the very beginning of the gh centuries, there is the logical conclusion that the fragment from the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church has brought to us the presently oldest known artefact stating a Croatian ethnic and, thus, the oldest presently known record of a župan (viceroy) in the early-medieval Croatia. Since at the locality of Bijaći there have been excavated remains of two ecclesiastical buildings in two layers (the earlier > paleo-Christian, and the later early-medieval), it iseventually also 2 ̆ 7. ! discussed the issue of which of them stood as a sacral building in (the early Middle Ages and which of them was decorated with the seulptures discussed in the paper. Following a briefreview ofresults ofthe researches performed so far and other opinions presented on the topicS, it is concluded that the first early-medieval church ofSt. Martha was a simple, three-vessel, three-trave, three-apse church, the vessels being mutually separated with square, masonry py!ons, the first pylon leaned against the inner side of the western wall, and the fourth against the triumphal arch of the large, central, square apse, in the way that it, at one side and with the ais!e flat wall surfaces, forms smaller lateral square apses, and at the other side further deepens and monumentalises the central apse space. With such basic ground plan, the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church is very close to the St. Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Church at Biskupija near Knin. It is also interesting that both churches are early-medieval structures built at the end ofthe 82 ̆ 7 b century as parts ofthe then Croatian sovereigns 2 ̆ 7 residentiaI complexes. Namely, in such an environment, churches with such emphasized central apse were well justified since they could occasionally have been used as halls for performing ofvarious royal jobs (aula regis), in line with the contemporary European practice. From all that issaid above results that the St. Martha 2 ̆ 7 s Church makes apart ofan architectural complex ofutmost importancefor the Croatian early-medieval sculpture, which, besides very important fragments ofthe early-medieval sculpture ofthe end ofthe 82 ̆ 7 h or the very beginning ofthe gh centuries, also produced the so far the earliest known information on the then Croats in their new country...|$|E

40|$|The Canadian {{ornamental}} horticulture 1 industry, with a 2005 farm gate production of approximately $ 2. 2 billion, {{is one of}} Canada’s best kept agricultural secrets and success stories (Watson, 2006). However, the domestic market for ornamentals has remained relatively flat, despite the increased interest in gardening and landscaping {{over the past two}} decades, because flowers, indoor plants and landscaping have to compete with many other luxury items for the Canadian consumer dollar. The recent slowdown in the Canadian industry has been mirrored around the globe as a result of higher energy and labour costs, increased competition and depressed consumer spending. To survive, the industry has to sell more plants or flowers and obtain higher prices. The four ways to increase ornamental sales are: • Increase the number of purchasing households and younger customers • Increase the frequency of purchases by existing buyers • Increase the transaction value per buying occasion • Create a popular culture of personal use and enjoyment of ornamentals All of these require new and collaborative marketing schemes that promote ornamental flowers and plants in different ways than have been used in the past.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Infrageneric {{classification}} in Ribes {{has previously}} {{relied on a}} few, often conflicting, morphological markers, such as spines, glands, and inflorescence morphology. Suggestions that hybridization drives {{the evolution of the}} genus have not been tested using phylogenetic methods. To assess the validity of infrageneric classifications and the importance of hybridization to the evolution of the group, and to develop an explicit phylogenetic hypothesis, I surveyed exemplars from all subgenera for restriction site variation in two cpDNA regions. Parsimony analysis shows that red currants, European alpine currants, golden currants, true gooseberries, and western gooseberries appear on separate clades. A less well supported Glade includes the western North American <b>ornamental</b> currant <b>group</b> and a portion of the dwarf currants. The presence of distinct lineages in Ribes is strongly supported by characters with very high consistency, suggesting that hybridization among infrageneric groups is not common in the genus. Unexpectedly, spiny currants and true gooseberries are united, suggesting either a sister group relationship or the possibility that one of these groups arose by reticulate evolution. The four black currant species examined exhibit surprisingly high divergence, and are not monophyletic in the analysis. Maximum likelihood analysis supports these results. Basal relationships of these lineages are not well resolved. A similar analysis of a portion of the nuclear ribosomal repeat produced very few characters. Although these data are highly homoplasious, their analysis bears some resemblance to that of the chloroplast DNA. Most prominently, the ornamental currant Glade has identical membership.

Similarly, there is little information on mycorrhizae in the Great Plains between the forested regions of the Mississippi River states and the Rocky Mountains. Because this predominantly grassland area is sparse in natural tree growth the individual tree as an <b>ornamental</b> or in <b>groups</b> as windbreaks becomes of great importance.

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in ornamentation in primates {{may have}} been sexually selected as signals of rank and dominance to males or by augmenting attractiveness to females. While male primates display tremendous variation in secondary sexual traits, such as sexual skin, capes of hair, and beards, which are often attributed to sexual selection, their phylogenetic distribution remains to be fully understood. Here we investigate the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in ornaments is more pronounced in larger more ‘anonymous’ social organizations where quick reliable assessment of male quality, social status, dominance, and aggressiveness are selective pressures. Multiple regression analyses, including phylogenetic correction, were performed on 154 species representing 45 genera of simian primates. We found {{a positive relationship between}} degree of <b>ornamental</b> dimorphism and <b>group</b> size, even after controlling for other independent variables such as habitat type (i. e. openness of terrain) and fission–fusion dynamics. Dimorphism was also significantly associated with social organization, so that males from species with multilevel social organizations had the highest ratings for ornamentation. In sum, our analysis suggests that among primates with larger group sizes and multilevel social organizations, males have more developed visually conspicuous secondary sexual traits. This may reflect selection for amplified signals of individual identity, rank, dominance, or attractiveness in large and complex social organizations wherein social and physical conflict may arise frequently and individual recognition is limited...|$|R

50|$|Wild C. pepo {{is still}} {{found in the}} same areas as C. fraterna in Mexico. Their {{isozymes}} are very similar. C. pepo has more similarities to C. fraterna {{than it does to}} C. texana, which is also claimed to be an ancestor of C. pepo. All studied C. fraterna alleles are also found in C. pepo. Consequently, C. fraterna is the nearest relative of C. pepo. C. pepo is most likely an early domesticated form of C. fraterna. It crosses well with both C. pepo and C. texana. Unlike most wild Cucurbita species, some fruit specimens of C. fraterna have been found that were not bitter. Its usual habitat is dry upland scrub areas. C. pepo could be a compilospecies of C. fraterna and C. texana, which appear to be two species that were originally separate. Based on genetic allele analysis, two distinct groups occur within C. pepo: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and marrow squash are in one; and ornamental gourds, crookneck, acorn, scallop, and a few others in the second one. C. fraterna is genetically closer to the first group and C. texana is genetically closer to the second <b>group.</b> <b>Ornamental</b> gourds found in Texas are called var. texana and those found outside of Texas (Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) are called var. ozarkana. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C. pepo, Paris suggested that the original wild specimen was a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He also suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants, and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and pumpkin.|$|R
40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for <b>ornamental</b> purposes. Another <b>group</b> is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to production holdings. Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like balcony and patio plants, some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low plant density. Overhead sprinklers induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower nurseries, potted plant nurseries are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species. Even if they are specialised in one plant type, different plant stages are present at the same time, like with Kalanchoë and Chrysanthemum...|$|R

The plants were donated by local farmers and after sorting, these were divided into roots, stems and leaves, and, subsequently, washed, dried and was determined their concentration of nutrients. The experimental design was randomized using four repetitions and the species of ornamental plants were considered as treatments. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and compared by Scott-Knott test (5 %). For the macronutrient, the greater accumulation of N was in Podocarpus macrophyllus. The Clusia fluminensis tree had the highest calcium and magnesium accumulations. The largest amounts of P and S were accumulated in Rhapis excelsa and Podocarpus macrophyllus. The greatest accumulation of K was in Rhapis excelsa, Dracaena marginata, Podocarpus macrophyllus, Murraya paniculata and Ixora coccinea. Smaller amounts of macronutrients were accumulated in Dypsis lutescens and Viburnum prunifolium. As for the macronutrients, the largest accumulation of Cu was observed in broad leaf Rhapis excelsa. Clusia fluminensis tree and Dracaena marginata accumulated the largest amounts of Mn. Regarding the Zn, Rhapis excelsa, Dracaena marginata and Ligustrum sinense were plants with higher accumulation.
