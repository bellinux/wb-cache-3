40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} A-infinity persistence {{of a given}} homology filtration of topological spaces. This is a family, one for each n > 0, of homological invariants which provide information not readily available by the (persistent) Betti numbers of the given filtration. This may help to detect noise, {{not just in the}} simplicial structure of the filtration but in further geometrical properties in which the higher codiagonals of the A-infinity structure are translated. Based in the classification of zigzag modules, a characterization of the A-infinity persistence in terms of its associated barcode is given. Comment: 22 pages, no figures. In versions 2 and 3, we added <b>our</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> and made some minor corrections, thanks to Jim Stashef...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{development}} of a drug product Manufacturing Classification System (MCS) based on processing route. It summarizes conclusions from a dedicated APS conference and subsequent discussion within APS focus groups and the MCS working party. The MCS is intended as a tool for pharmaceutical scientists to rank the feasibility of different processing routes for the manufacture of oral solid dosage forms, based on selected properties of the API and the needs of the formulation. It has many applications in pharmaceutical development, in particular, it will provide a common understanding of risk by defining what the "right particles'' are, enable the selection of the best process, and aid subsequent transfer to manufacturing. The ultimate aim is one of prediction of product developability and processability based upon previous experience. This paper is intended to stimulate contribution from a broad range of stakeholders to develop the MCS concept further and apply it to practice. In particular, opinions are sought on what API properties are important when selecting or modifying materials to enable an efficient and robust pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Feedback can be given by replying to <b>our</b> dedicated <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> (mcs@apsgb. org); completing the survey on our LinkedIn site; or by attending one of our planned conference roundtable sessions...|$|R

50|$|A {{directory}} harvest attack (DHA) is {{a technique}} used by spammers {{in an attempt to}} find valid/existent <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain by using brute force. The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> are found by brute force guessing valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain).|$|R

Our contributions are threefold: First, we identify the components {{of a system that}} realizes the concept of extended <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> and investigate the functionality of these components in a manner which is backwards compatible to current e-mail tools. Secondly, we specify an adversarial model, and give the necessary properties of extended <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> and of the procedure to obtain them {{in the presence of the}} adversary.

If the public key does not belong to whoever reads the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> they are unable to decrypt the encrypted key, but the accompanying message gives them sufficient information {{to let them know that}} someone is attempting to impersonate them.|$|R

40|$|Résumés are {{screened}} rapidly, {{with some}} reports stating that recruiters form their impressions within 10 seconds. Certain résumé characteristics {{can have a}} significant impact on the snap judgments these recruiters make. The main goal of the present study was to examine the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> (formal vs. informal) used in a résumé on the hirability perceptions formed by professional recruiters (N= 73). In addition, the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability perceptions was compared to the effects of spelling errors and typeface. Participants assessed the cognitive ability, personality, and the hirability of six fictitious applicants for the job of an HR specialist. The hirability ratings for the résumés with informal <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> were significantly lower than the hirability ratings for résumés that featured a formal <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> was as strong as the effect of spelling errors and stronger than that of typeface. The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability was mediated by perceptions of conscientiousness and honesty-humility.

40|$|Writing E-mail is {{the most}} popular Internet activity. Meanwhile, many people have more than one <b>E-mail</b> <b>address.</b> The {{question}} how people manage their <b>E-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> more specifically, whether they use them deliberately for different purposes, is the central question of this paper. <b>E-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> vary in the amount of identifying information they convey (e. g., name, gender, status). It is proposed that the amount of identifying information an email address contains is a predictor of usage for a specific purpose. However, it is assumed that not all people choose email addresses in a rational way, according to the optimal fit between amount of identifying information and purpose of the E-mail. Thus, the role of other factors is tested as well. An online survey on German Internet users showed that it is common to have more than one <b>E-mail</b> <b>address.</b> Especially free webmail addresses (freemail) are extremely popular. People used more anonymous <b>E-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> when they expected spam or were concerned about privacy. However, there were also interindividual differences in the management of <b>E-mail</b> <b>addresses...</b>|$|R

50|$|While {{the basic}} concept was effective, the Penet remailer had several {{vulnerabilities}} which threatened {{the anonymity of}} its users.

A potential attacker needed only to access that list to compromise the identities of all of Penet’s users. The Penet remailer was on two occasions required by the legal system in Finland (the country where the Penet server hardware resided) {{to turn over the}} real <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> that was mapped to an anonymous <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> Another potential vulnerability was that messages sent to and from the remailer were all sent in cleartext, making it vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping.|$|R

This {{has led to the}} evolution of more sophisticated spambots that are able to recover <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> from character strings that appear to be munged, or instead can render the text into a web browser and then scrape it for <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses.</b> Alternative transparent techniques include displaying {{all or part of the}} <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on a web page as an image, a text logo shrunken to normal size using inline CSS, or as text with the order of characters jumbled, placed into readable order at display time using CSS.|$|R
