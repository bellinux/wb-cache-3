5000|$|The main use of {{gadolinium}} oxysulfide is in ceramic scintillators. Scintillators {{are used}} in radiation detectors for medical diagnostics. The scintillator is the primary radiation sensor that emits light when struck by high energy photons. Gd2O2S based ceramics exhibit final densities of 99.7% to 99.99% of the theoretical density (7.32 g/cm3) and an average grain size ranging from 5 micrometers to 50 micrometers in dependence with the fabrication procedure. [...] Two powder preparation routes have been successful for synthesizing Gd2O2S: Pr, Ce, F powder complexes for the ceramic scintillators. These preparations routes are called the halide flux method and the sulfite precipitation method. The scintillation properties of Gd2O2S: Pr, Ce, F complexes demonstrate that this scintillator is promising for imaging applications. There are two main disadvantages to this scintillator; one being the hexagonal crystal structure, which emits only <b>optical</b> <b>translucency</b> and low external light collection at the photodiode. The other disadvantage is the high X-ray damage to the sample.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAerocelluloses are {{considered}} as “third generation” aerogels after the silica and synthetic polymer-based ones. However, their brittleness and low <b>optical</b> <b>translucency</b> keep quite narrow their fields of applications. Here, both issues are addressed successfully through the fabrication of flexible and mechanically robust amorphous aerocellulose with high optical transparency, using trifluoroacetic acid as a solvent and ethanol as a non-solvent. The developed aerocellulose displays a meso-macroporous interconnected nanofibrous cellulose skeleton with low density and high specific surface area. We demonstrate its high efficiency as supporting matrix for nanoscale systems by incorporating {{a variety of}} colloidal quatum dots, that provide bright and stable photoluminescence to the flexible aerocellulose host...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{translucent}} tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (TZP) ceramics, complete densification, and homogeneous microstructure free of agglomerates and residual pores are required. To achieve this goal, freeze granulation of the zirconia nanopowder was performed. A series of stable and homogeneous zirconia suspension without agglomerates was prepared, by varying the solids loading volume percentage, to study {{the influence of the}} suspension characteristics on the freeze granulation behaviors. The characteristics of the prepared powder granules in terms of their size, flowability, and packing behaviors were subsequently analyzed. Uni-axial dry-pressing of the optimal granulate was used to prepare ceramic green bodies, which demonstrated the level of high strength and rigidness suitable for green milling based on the principle of computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided machining (CAM). Green bodies were sintered in air under conventional pressure-less condition. The sample sintered at 1400 oC demonstrated a high <b>optical</b> <b>translucency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} seventies high {{chromite}} and low base metal sulphide (BMS) contents of the UG 2 reef imposes technological challenges to mineral processors and extractive metallurgists. Forty years later, particle size distribution and size by size mineralogy are considered as key factors to the continuous improvement of the UG- 2 ore metallurgy. With the successful development of ultra fine grinding technologies, a compromise has to be found between fine grinding to achieve platinum group minerals liberation and to avoid the overgrinding of gangue minerals, especially chromite gangue which is detrimental in smelting process. Indeed, fine chromite grains, despite of being naturally hydrophobic mineral, can be recovered in flotation concentrate by entrainment. In addition, overgrinding also increase liberation of naturally floatable gangue (talc) which contaminate the concentrate {{and need to be}} controlled during flotation. In this paper, innovative techniques of single particle image analysis from both dry and wet samples have been tentatively used to assess the chromite particle size distribution and the chromite grade of samples taken from a secondary milling circuit. Preliminary results demonstrate excellent potential for online particle imaging making use of both the particle geometry (size, shape) and the <b>optical</b> properties (<b>translucency).</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Stone is {{widespread}} {{in its use}} as a building material and artistic medium. One of its most remarkable qualities is that it changes appearance as it interacts with the environment. These changes are mainly confined to the surface but involve complex volumetric effects such as erosion and mineral dissolution. This paper presents an approach for the modeling and rendering {{of changes in the}} shape and appearance of stone. To represent stone, we introduce a slab data structure, which is a surface-aligned volume confined to a narrow region around the boundary of the stone. Our weathering model employs a simulation of the flow of moisture and the transport, dissolution, and recrystallization of minerals within the porous stone volume. In addition, this model governs the erosion of material from the surface. To render the <b>optical</b> effects of <b>translucency</b> and coloration due to the composition of minerals near the surface, we simulate the scattering of light inside the stone using a general subsurface Monte Carlo ray tracer. These techniques can capture many aspects of the time-dependent appearance of stone. We demonstrate the approach with models of granite and marble statues, as well as a sandstone column.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Indiana University School of DentistryBackground: With the {{emerging}} of digital dentistry, IPS e. max® CAD lithium disilicate (LD) glass-ceramic material {{has become one}} of the most popular esthetic restorative materials in digital assisted dental esthetic restoration. The mechanical and optical properties of this material have been investigated in several studies. However, there is a lack of information and consensus regarding the optical properties of IPS e. max® LD glass-ceramic materials. Objectives: 1) To investigate the <b>optical</b> properties as <b>translucency</b> parameters (TP), Contrast ratio (CR), light transmissions (Lt) and color changes (CC) between high-translucent (HT) and low-translucent (LT) IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramic materials with different crystalline phases and thickness in different firing stages. 2) To investigate the optical properties as TP, CR, Lt and CC of each translucent (HT and LT) IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramic materials with different crystalline phases and thickness in different firing stages. 3) To determine the mathematical relationships of thicknesses of IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramics materials with TP and Lt. Materials and methods: The total of 120 of shade A 2 IPS max CAD samples (HT and LT) were prepared into square shape (15. 25 mm X 15. 25 mm) and were divided into two main groups according to the material translucency (HT and LT) (n= 60). Each main group was further divided into 5 sub-groups according to the thickness (1. 00, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75, and 2. 00 mm) (n= 12). Each thickness group was assigned into three groups based on different crystallization (firing) temperatures (750, 820 °C in single stage heating schedule with 1 second and 10 second holding times, respectively, and 840 °C with two-stage heating schedule (RECOM) (820 °C, 840 °C with 10 second and 7 min holding time, respectively) as recommended by manufacturer (n= 4). CIEL*a*b*, TP, CR, and Lt were measured and calculated for all samples. Statistical analysis: The effects of the test results were evaluated using 3 -way ANOVA with factors for Translucency (HT and LT), Firing Temperature (750, 850, and RECOM) and Thickness (1, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75, and 2), as well as all two-way and three-way interactions among the factors. Pair-wise comparisons were made using Least Significant Differences to control the overall significance level at 5 %. Results: The mean irradiance and TP for both HT and LT decrease as the thickness of the samples increases from 1 to 2 mm with significant difference between the thickness groups within each material translucency groups (HT and LT) and between both HT and LT. The coefficients of absorption (c) of the two materials were calculated. The effective incidence irradiance when material thickness approaches zero (Ie) was also calculated. There is an unexpected spectral peak shift as the thickness of the samples increases. There is no statistically significant difference in Ie at 750 ˚C and 820 ˚C between the HT and LT. However, there is a statistically significant higher Ie in HT at the recommended firing temperature as expected. Coefficients of translucency parameter (p) of the materials in various firing temperature were defined and the TP of the material as the thickness approaches zero were calculated (TP 0). The TP of the materials is directly correlated to the mean irradiance passing through the samples. There is no statistically significant difference in the TP 0 and Ie of the HT and LT groups at the recommended firing temperature. Conclusion: In this project we developed modified Beer-Lambert law to describe the parameters governing the effect of thickness on light transmission in dental ceramic material. We also applied the same equation to describe the translucency parameter. The parameters defined in these equations allow us to compare the optical property of dental ceramic material independent of the thickness of the samples. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) {{was first}} used as a marker of protein {{expression}} in vivo 18 years ago, heralding {{the beginning of what}} became known as the Green Revolution. Since then, there has been an explosion in the number of transgenic lines in existence, and these transgenic tools are now being applied to skeletal research. Advances in transgenesis are also leading to increasing use of new model organisms for studying skeletogenesis. Such new models include the small teleosts zebrafish and medaka, which due to their <b>optical</b> <b>translucency</b> offer imaging possibilities in the live animals. In this review, we will introduce a number of recent advances in genetic engineering and transgenesis and the new genetic tools that are currently being developed. We will provide examples of how zebrafish and medaka transgenic lines are helping us to understand the behaviour of skeletal cells in vivo. Finally, we will discuss future prospects for the application of transgenic technology to skeletal research...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} is {{an excellent}} animal model to study {{the formation of the}} vertebrate vascular network. The small size, the <b>optical</b> <b>translucency,</b> and the ability to model endothelial-specific fl uorescent transgenic lines in the zebrafish embryo had facilitate, in the past 10 years, the direct visualization of vessels formation and remodeling. Furthermore, zebrafish {{is an excellent}} disease model such as for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a human neurovascular degenerative disease, caused by Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides deposition around brain microvessels, and characterized by vascular brain degenerative changes. By using the zebrafish model, we investigated the effect of Aβ peptides treatment in vessel formation during embryogenesis. We showed that the defects in the vascular remodeling and senescence can be detected, respectively, via staining for alkaline phosphatase activity and β-galactosidase or cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p 21 expression. We demonstrated that treating zebrafish embryos with these oxidative peptides reduces angiogenesis and promotes premature vascular senescence. In this chapter, we will describe the methods to reveal both angiogenesis and senescence defects upon Aβ peptides treatment of the zebrafish embryos...|$|E
40|$|Injury, {{infection}} and tissue malfunction are triggers of inflammation which if not regulated may acquire new characteristics {{that result in}} pathological outcomes. Since innate immunity {{plays a key role}} in the resolution of acute inflammation knowledge of the regulation of this component of the host response is relevant to understanding processes in disease progression and therefore has potential clinical benefits. In this thesis I have applied zebrafish as a model organism to investigate the response of innate immune cells to qualitatively distinct inflammatory signals in the absence of adaptive immunity. Using a zebrafish embryo wound injury model I have investigated leukocyte migration profiles by in vivo imaging. In response to wound alone leukocytes migrated to the site of injury with predominantly random walk behaviour. However, the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced recruitment and influenced the directionality of leukocyte migration to the wound. I demonstrate that leukocyte dynamic behaviour is also dependent on the location of the cells. The LPS enhanced directionality and reduced the random walk behaviour of the leukocytes, and these effects were ablated in the presence of the p 38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) specific inhibitor SB 203580. Cytokine gene profiling in adult zebrafish leukocytes reveals that LPS can stimulate a pro-inflammatory response via the activation of p 38 MAPK characteristic of mammalian innate immune responses. It is documented in mammalian innate immune cells that LPS can modulate Notch mediated signalling and thereby cell function. Using zebrafish with null mutations in Notch, which provide an unbiased in vivo model, I have investigated the influence of Notch signalling on leukocyte recruitment and demonstrate that migration to a wound injury is reduced. However, this effect is due to decreased cell numbers and not altered function as the Notch signalling inhibitor DAPT had no effect of recruitment to wound injury. The defect in myelomonocyte numbers was also present in adult zebrafish and this was partially compensated for by an increase in lymphocytes. The experimental results that I report here highlight zebrafish as a model 2 organism for studying the function and regulation of innate immunity. The unique <b>optical</b> <b>translucency,</b> which permits in vivo imaging of host responses in real-time, facilitates the analysis of the innate immune response to different inflammatory signals and immune modulators.
