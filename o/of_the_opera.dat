5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opera.</b> V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opera,</b> where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E

5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council.

5|$|The first {{commercial}} recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from <b>the</b> Savoy <b>operas.</b> In 1917, <b>the</b> Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced <b>the</b> first album <b>of</b> a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan <b>opera,</b> <b>The</b> Mikado, followed by recordings of eight more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operas.</b> Electrical recordings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete musical scores <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operas</b> were then {{issued by the}} Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company {{beginning in the late}} 1920s.

5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of starchy {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opera</b> also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opéra,</b> and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele.

5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy.

In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opera</b> consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E
