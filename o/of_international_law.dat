40|$|The rules <b>of</b> <b>international</b> {{humanitarian}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> {{armed conflict}} are codified {{in a rather}} extensive body of treaty law. In addition, extensive {{research has been conducted}} into the rules <b>of</b> customary <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> The author of this contribution will argue that there is another important source <b>of</b> positive <b>international</b> humanitarian law: principles <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> In this chapter, the role of the principles <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law,</b> the functions they perform and their legal significance as a source <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law</b> will be assessed. With general public <b>international</b> <b>law</b> as its starting point, the chapter discusses the sources <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> It explains the important role of the Martens Clause and provides examples of how the principles <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law</b> may be applied in contemporary armed conflicts...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> {{humanitarian}} <b>law</b> forms part <b>of</b> <b>international</b> criminal <b>law.</b> The <b>international</b> criminal <b>law</b> <b>of</b> {{war crimes}} in turn forms part <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> <b>International</b> criminal <b>law</b> and its application through international criminal tribunals (international criminal justice) are increasingly {{important for the}} implementation <b>of</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> In this contribution, the author tries to define and differentiate the two branches. Particular emphasis is put on the influence <b>of</b> <b>international</b> criminal <b>law</b> upon <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law.</b> The former {{has contributed to the}} implementation of the latter in general and to the development and clarification of the substance of the latter, but that viewing <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law</b> through the lens <b>of</b> <b>international</b> criminal <b>law</b> also entails risks, which are discussed in this articl...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the substantive issues in the case, there was also more general historical and theoretical issues involved.

5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law.</b> Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Stevens {{returned}} to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at the American University and Columbia University in international law and foreign policy.

From Cuba, she went to The Hague for the first World Conference on the Codification <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship.

40|$|International {{taxation}} {{has taken}} {{a central role in}} the ongoing political and economic crisis. There is a growing consensus in society that there is a need to change the current rules and norms <b>of</b> <b>international</b> taxation, since the changes in society are not properly reflected in the body of law called 'international tax law'. The starting point of this study is therefore that <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> is struggling with legitimacy problems in a society that is changing very quickly. The objective of this study is to improve the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law.</b> In this respect, it focuses on two separate 'tracks': the legal framework <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> and the contribution of social-scientific knowledge to the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law.</b> The first part of the study concerns a research of the development <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> in the period following the Second World War. This includes an analysis of the changing characteristics <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> and the development of the dominant norms <b>of</b> <b>international</b> taxation. The second part of the study considers the possibilities to improve the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law.</b> In this respect, the study considers both the work of the German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas, and the possibilities and limitations of the contribution of social-scientific knowledge to the contribution of the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law.</b> The latter element is, for example, relevant in order to evaluate the domination of capital import neutrality and capital export neutrality as ‘sources’ of the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> in the history of this field of law. Finally, the third part of the study does recommendations to improve the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> on the basis of the findings of the first parts of the study. This includes, amongst others, a different understanding <b>of</b> <b>international</b> tax <b>law</b> that is called ‘deliberative international tax law’...|$|R

However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement.

5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

Worley concludes his review by recommending the book for those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law.</b> He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of targeted killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E
5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and a large body <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
