5|$|King Stephen II died {{in early}} 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as Tarih-i Üngürüs or The History of the Hungariansnarrates that Béla ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had {{nominated}} as his heir had died. Béla II was crowned in Székesfehérvár on 28 April, substantiating the reliability <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report.</b> However, no scholarly {{consensus on the}} exact circumstances of Béla's ascension exists. According to Gyula Kristó, Béla was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a civil war between his and Saul's partisans, but Pál Engel does not mention any conflict related to Béla's succession.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{intervened in}} a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the credibility <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> has been questioned.|$|E

During the last few months <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>reporting</b> period, considerable time and effort was also devoted to the submission of AXAF observing proposals in preparation for the upcoming AXAF launch.

5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> in 1963, the government authorised {{a survey of}} the whole deviation route. However, it was not until September 1964 that the project was actually approved at an estimated cost of $11,434,000. In November, construction was further delayed by six months until funding of $710,000 was finally approved in the following years budget for the 1965-1966 financial year.

25|$|The US {{commissioned}} {{an independent}} investigation headed by Arthur Garfield Hays, {{general counsel of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, together with prominent citizens of Puerto Rico. The members concluded in their report that the event was a massacre, with the police acting as a mob. They harshly criticized Winship's actions as governor and said he had numerous abuses of civil rights. The event has since been known as the Ponce massacre. It was the largest massacre in Puerto Rican history. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> and other charges against Winship, he was dismissed from his position in 1937 and replaced as governor.|$|E

25|$|The Government of Gujarat had {{initiated}} {{a study in}} response to the workers' rally in Bhavnagar and representations made by Sishuvihar, an NGO based in Ahmadabad. The committee constituted for the study also included former Deputy Director of NIOH, Ahmadabad. The committee noted that the WHO, FAO, IARC and US EPA have indicated that endosulfan is not carcinogenic, not teratogenic, not mutagenic and not genotoxic. The highlight <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> is the farmer exposure study based on analysis of their blood reports for residues of endosulfan and the absence of any residues. This corroborates the lack of residues in worker-exposure studies.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the John Templeton Foundation {{sponsored}} a report titled , highlighting {{the disparity between}} the research on acceleration (which generally supports it, both from an academic and a psychological point of view), and the educational practices in the US that are often contrary to the conclusions of that research.

25|$|The Case Study Final Report is {{the main}} focus so that ideal {{preparation}} may take place.; this report does, after all, contain all the entomological findings and conclusions relevant to the case. The report should be detailed thoroughly, but should still allow room for speculation, because forensic entomology is still a relatively new science, {{and it would be}} a bit overzealous for the forensic entomologist to announce full certainty on the subject; said speculation should not exist when it comes to the evidence. Disclosure <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> to the opposing side before the trial is recommended so that the defense and/or prosecution have time to consult another expert witness to look over the original findings.|$|E

25|$|Following the Jervois-Scratchley {{reports the}} colonial governments of Australia {{restructured}} their defence forces. One {{of the many}} outcomes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> was {{the formation of the}} Queensland Maritime Defence Force. To equip the new force, the colonial government purchased two gunboats and a torpedo boat. Paluma was the second of the two gunboats purchased by the colony and was a sister ship of HMQS Gayundah, which together formed the Gayundah class. This class was built to a type B1 flat-iron gunboat design from builders Sir W.G. Armstrong, Mitchell & Co at Newcastle-on-Tyne. They were improved, slightly larger versions of HMVS Albert which was also built in 1884 for the colony of Victoria.|$|E
25|$|In FY 2009, Mexican courts {{continued}} to demonstrate patterns of delay in processing applications under the Convention, {{as illustrated by}} several of the cases listed under Mexico in the “Unresolved Return Applications” section <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report.</b> In at least two instances, six months elapsed between the time the case was assigned to a court and {{the date of the}} first hearing; in another, seven months elapsed. In five other cases, it took between 16 and 55 months before the court held the first hearing on the application for return. These delays disadvantaged LBPs and led to rulings that the children should not be returned because they had become “settled” in their new environment, an exception to return listed in Article 12 of the Convention.|$|E

Other relevant information is a list of all evidence collected, including specimens and all identification and rearing procedures performed, a PMI estimate, and a summarized conclusion based on all the findings. Copies <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> are submitted to the contact officer, the forensic entomologist, and as a courtesy, to the medical examiner. If throughout the course of the investigation, any manipulation of the specimens occurred (i.e. dissecting, rearing, then a copy of the specimen disposition and identification form should also be included in the report).|$|E

25|$|Secondary and {{tertiary}} sources {{indicate that the}} island may have been named after the inhabitants of St Andro Island (aka St Andrew or San Andrés) off the Mosquito Coast of Honduras, because 1,400 migrants reportedly settled in Andros in 1787. Contemporary records, including official Bahamian census figures from 1788 and 1807, indicate {{that the number of}} inhabitants of Andros in that period was fewer than 400, and the original source <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> remains obscure. Only 2,650 individuals were evacuated from the Mosquito Coast in 1787, including individuals evacuated from St. Andrews Island, and 2,214 are known to have settled in Belize. The misconception appears to stem from a misreading of the Royal Geographic Society account of the transfer of the inhabitants from St. Andrews to Andros. The 1879 report states that the descendants of the migrants living in northern Andros numbered 1,400 as of 1879, as opposed to their ancestors comprising that number in 1787 when the original migration took place.|$|E
