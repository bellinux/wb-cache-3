500|$|Besides {{the great}} trilogy, Clement's only other extant {{work is the}} {{treatise}} Salvation for the Rich, also known as Who is the Rich Man who is Saved? Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The rich are either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of <b>our</b> <b>neighbor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Matthew Henry {{taught that}} the {{prohibition}} against false witness concerns {{our own and}} our neighbor’s good name. [...] “Thou shalt not bear false witness” forbids: “1. Speaking falsely in any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising and designing to deceive <b>our</b> <b>neighbor.</b> 2. Speaking unjustly against <b>our</b> <b>neighbor,</b> to the prejudice of his reputation; and (which involves the guilty of both). 3. Bearing false witness against him, laying to his charge things that he knows not, either judicially, upon oath (by which the third commandment, and the sixth and eighth, as well as this, are broken), or extrajudicially, in common converse, slandering, backbiting, tale-bearing, aggravating what is done amiss and making it worse than it is, and any way endeavoring to raise our own reputation upon the ruin of our neighbor’s." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving <b>our</b> <b>neighbor</b> whom we can see. Loving <b>our</b> <b>neighbor</b> is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: [...] "The DPRK is <b>our</b> <b>neighbor.</b> We maintain a good-neighborly relationship.

2500|$|Calvin further {{teaches that}} {{obedience}} {{requires us to}} be contented with our own lot. [...] We should desire to acquire nothing but honest and lawful gain.

[...] We must not heap up wealth cruelly wrung from the blood of others. [...] It should be our constant aim faithfully to lend our counsel and aid to all so as {{to assist them in}} retaining their property; or if we {{have to do with the}} perfidious or crafty, let us rather be prepared to yield somewhat of our right than to contend with them.

A Christian philosophy of athletics was written to guide the athletic development of students and to reflect Christian values on the playing field and in the stands. CHA's philosophy of athletics is as follows: Since we are ambassadors for Jesus Christ, let us conduct ourselves in word and action just as Christ would conduct himself. Therefore, all that we do, we will do with a total release of our mental and physical abilities and our emotional energies towards our performance, having in mind that Christ is our only audience.
