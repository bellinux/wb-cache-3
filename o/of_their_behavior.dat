They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be {{justified}} in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.|$|E

25|$|The Penitentiary was {{intended}} {{not simply to}} punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While {{some have argued that}} the Pennsylvania System was Quaker-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's Pennsylvania Prison Society) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, William White. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.|$|E
25|$|Science-fiction author Orson Scott Card {{was hired}} to write a novelization of the film based on the {{screenplay}} and discussions with Cameron. He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit {{on the far side}} of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the deus ex machina aspects of the film.|$|E
25|$|The sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, meanwhile, are {{behaving}} wickedly, {{for example}} by taking for themselves all the prime {{cuts of meat}} from sacrifices, and by committing adultery with the women who serve at the sanctuary entrance. Eli is aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> but he rebukes them too lightly and ultimately does not stop them. The sons continue in their sinful behavior, and so, according to the text, a man of God prophesies to Eli that Eli and his family will be punished for this, with all male descendants dying before reaching old age and being placed in positions subservient to prophets from other lineages. The curse alludes to a previous (not appearing elsewhere in the Bible) promise from God of Eli's lineage continuing eternally (c.f. similar promises to King David and Jehonadab). While this continuation is not revoked, a curse is placed on all of Eli's male descendants forever. As {{a sign of the}} accuracy of this future, Eli is told by the man of God that his sons will die on the same day.|$|E

500|$|Brains {{are most}} simply {{compared}} {{in terms of}} their size. The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0.75. [...] This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior.</b> For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey, relative to body size.|$|E
500|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis}} identifies {{somewhat different}} ranges for the subspecies lineages. The genetic analysis, for example, identifies an additional pattern of deep divergence {{in the eastern}} part of the range. The spatial distribution of populations and genetics of this species links spatially and historically through the interconnecting mountain and temperate valley systems of western North America. The breeding fidelity of long-toed salamanders (philopatry) and other migratory behaviours reduce rates of dispersal among regions, such as within mountain basins. This aspect <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> restricts gene flow and increases the degree and rates of genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation among regions is higher in the long-toed salamander than measured in most other vertebrate groups. Natural breaks in the range of dispersal and [...] occur where ecosystems grade into drier xeric low-lands (such as prairie climates) and at frozen or harsher terrain at high elevation extremes (...)

500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior</b> was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that Mars was Nergal, {{the god of}} war and plague. During Sumerian times, Nergal was a minor deity of little significance, but, during later times, his main cult center was the city of Nineveh. In Mesopotamian texts, Mars {{is referred to as}} the [...] "star of judgement of the fate of the dead". The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by the ancient Egyptian astronomers and, by 1534 BCE, they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet. By the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>behavior.</b> For Mars, they knew that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. They invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets.|$|E
