5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the Comet 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4, which was based on the Comet 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (<b>outboard</b> <b>wing)</b> fuel tanks of the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 2016, the Australian Transport Minister, Darren Chester, {{said that}} a piece of {{aircraft}} debris was found on Pemba Island, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau announced on 22 June that a piece of debris found on an Australian island earlier in June was not from Flight 370. On 20 July, the Australian government released photos of the piece of debris found on Pemba Island around 24 June, believed to be an <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> flap.|$|E

50|$|Schlachtgeschwader 77 (SG 77) was a Luftwaffe close air support-wing of World War II. It {{was formed}} on 18 October 1943 in Wassilkow from Stab/Sturzkampfgeschwader 77. With the {{exception}} of II. Group, which was redesignated as III. Group, Schlachtgeschwader 10, the remaining groups were renamed to Schlachtgeschwader 77. On 3 March 1945, 9. Staffel equipped its Fw 190F-8s with Panzerblitz 80 mm anti-tank rockets. Adapted from the R4M rocket, these were carried under the <b>outboard</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{second major}} {{change to the}} RB-57D was the {{addition}} of Pratt & Whitney J57 engines {{in place of the}} Wright J65 engines used on all earlier B-57 models. The two J57 engines produced about [...] total thrust, about [...] more than the two J65 engines. Other changes in the D model included removal of all fuselage fuel tanks and the addition of [...] "wet wing" [...] fuel cells. All defensive armament was removed, and the bomb bay was also removed and replaced by avionics equipment.

25|$|A weapons load {{of up to}} 7,000kg {{could be}} {{accommodated}} on nine hardpoints: one centreline pylon, two fuselage pylons, two inner and two outer wing pylons and two pylons behind the wing landing gear. The centreline pylon was the only wet pylon and was usually occupied by an external fuel tank. A pair of air-to-air missiles were intended {{to be placed on}} the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> pylons, which were more lightweight than the other attachment points. The pylons behind the landing gear were not used until the JA 37D modification when BOY countermeasure dispensers were fitted to them. Ground crew would enter the munitions fitted into the aircraft's central computer using a load-selector panel, which would automatically choose the correct values for fire control, fuel consumption, and other calculations.|$|E
2500|$|Begun in 1947, the B-54 was {{the planned}} {{production}} {{version of the}} YB-50C prototype.

50|$|With {{a slight}} {{residual}} bank angle, a touchdown is typically accomplished with the upwind main wheels touching down {{just before the}} downwind wheels. Excessive control must be avoided because over-banking could cause the engine nacelle or <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> flap to contact the runway/ground.

50|$|With the {{acquisition}} of KC-97 Stratotankers from SAC, the 106th gaining command returned to Tactical Air Command in September 1969 and the it became the 106th Air Refueling Wing. Its mission was to provide air refueling to tactical fighter and reconnaissance aircraft. The KC-97 was {{a variant of the}} C-97 Stratofreighter and the conversion of the unit from transports to refueling aircraft was easily accomplished. The wing's KC-97Ls had added jet engine pods mounted on their <b>outboard</b> <b>wings.</b> It rotated personnel and aircraft to West Germany as part of Operation Creek Party, a continuous rotational mission flying from Rhein Main Air Base, West Germany, providing air refueling to United States Air Forces in Europe tactical aircraft.

50|$|The Owlet was a {{training}} {{version of the}} Cygnet II built {{as an attempt to}} produce a cheap primary trainer for the Royal Air Force. The main change was a modified fuselage with a tandem open cockpit (the Cygnet had an enclosed cockpit with side-by-side seating). The same <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> panels were used, but due to the slimmer fuselage, the resulting wingspan was reduced by 24 inches (61 cm), and wing area was reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Yaw rate input at any {{roll angle}} generates rudder, fin and {{fuselage}} force vectors which dominate the resultant yawing moment. Yawing also increases {{the speed of}} the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> whilst slowing down the inboard wing, with corresponding changes in drag causing a (small) opposing yaw moment. [...] opposes the inherent directional stiffness which tends to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind and always matches the sign of the yaw rate input.|$|E
5000|$|To {{control the}} airplane, the lines must remain in tension. Centrifugal force is {{generally}} sufficient to maintain line tension if the airplane is properly [...] "trimmed" [...] (adjusted), but sometimes additional {{features such as}} rudder offset and engine offset are added to provide extra tension. Weight in the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> tip is usually used to balance {{the weight of the}} lines. Top aerobatics models typically have a large number of adjustable features like tip weight boxes, adjustable rudder offset, adjustable line sweep, and adjustable elevator and flap controls. Some aerobatics models use a variable rudder system (commonly called the Rabe rudder after its inventor, Al Rabe) to vary the rudder offset during flight. The adjustment of the various adjustable features on a modern stunt model can become quite complex.Many models also feature a longer inboard wing; aerobatics models use this to balance the lift from side-to-side, compensating for the difference in velocity from inboard to <b>outboard</b> <b>wing,</b> while some speed models use a very exaggerated longer inboard wing to provide streamlining of the flying lines. On small speed models the drag of the flying lines can be three times the drag {{of the rest of the}} model.|$|E
50|$|With the {{acquisition}} of KC-97 Stratotankers from Strategic Air Command, the 104th was transferred back to Tactical Air Command in September 1969 and the 106th became an air refueling group.

50|$|Although {{the tanks}} were removable, this {{could only be}} done by first {{removing}} the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> panel, and so was not a routine maintenance task. A drawback to the tanks {{was that there was}} no means of measuring remaining fuel quantity within the cells. Fuel was moved from the cells to the engine tanks by opening control valves within the bomb bay so that the fuel drained by gravity. Although the tanks were specified as self-sealing, vapor buildup within partially drained tanks made them explosive hazards in combat.|$|E
50|$|U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigators}} queried the German Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), Germany's {{equivalent of}} the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the accident history of the Nimbus-4DM {{in conjunction with a}} 1999 accident near Minden, Nevada where both occupants of the aircraft were killed. In this accident, the glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in thermal lift conditions. Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the accident sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral. With a 45-degree nose-down attitude, the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations. The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near-vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)). The glider was observed to level its attitude, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> tip panels separated from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dived into the ground. Several witnesses estimated that the wing deflection reached 45 degrees or more before the wings failed. Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left and right <b>outboard</b> <b>wing</b> sections failed symmetrically at two locations.|$|E
25|$|Propulsion was {{achieved}} through three propellers: two <b>outboard</b> or <b>wing</b> propellers had three blades, while the central propeller had four. The two lateral propellers were powered by reciprocating steam triple expansion, while the central shaft {{was driven by}} a steam turbine. All power on board was derived from a total of 29 coal-fired steam boilers in six compartments. However, Olympics boilers were adapted for firing by oil {{at the end of}} the First World War, which reduced the number of engine crew required from 350 to 60.|$|R
