We will show {{in this paper}} that this scheme suffers from some weaknesses. Firstly, we will describe an attack which enables two adversaries in the same cell to communicate freely without being challenged by the <b>operator</b> <b>center.</b> We will put forward a solution to fix this protocol. Then we will describe another method that allows an attacker to determine the secret keys of the other users. This attack thwarts the micro-payment scheme’s purpose because an attacker can thus communicate without being charged. Finally we will suggest some solutions to counteract this attack...|$|E

Matrix ratings are defined based on multidimensional scaling techniques and multivariate analysis. The method consists of two distinct steps: (1) to determine the mathematical space of subjective judgements of a certain individual (or group of evaluators) for a given set of tasks and experimental conditionings; and (2) to relate this space with respect to both the task variables and the objective performance criteria used. Results for a variety of second-order trackings with smoothed noise-driven inputs indicate that: (1) many of the internally perceived task variables form a nonorthogonal set; and (2) the structure of the subjective space varies among groups of individuals according to the degree of familiarity they have with such tasks...|$|R

40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is a {{major cause}} of acute diarrheal illness {{worldwide}} and is responsible for high infant and child mortality rates in developing nations. Two types of enterotoxins, one heat labile and the other heat stable, are known to cause diarrhea. The expression of soluble heat-labile toxin is subject to catabolite (glucose) activation, and three binding sites for cAMP receptor protein (CRP or CAP) were identified upstream and within the toxin promoter by DNase I footprinting. One CRP <b>operator</b> is <b>centered</b> at − 31. 5, thus encompassing the promoter's − 35 hexamer. Potassium permanganate footprinting revealed that the occupancy of this operator prevents RNA polymerase from forming an open complex in vitro. However, the <b>operator</b> <b>centered</b> at − 31. 5 is not sufficient for full repression in vivo because the deletion of the other two CRP binding sites partially relieved the CRP-dependent repression of the heat-labile toxin promoter. In contrast to heat-labile toxin, CRP positively regulates the expression of heat-stable toxin. Thus, the conditions for the optimal expression of one enterotoxin limit the expression of the other. Since glucose inhibits the activity of CRP by suppressing the pathogen's synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP), the concentration of glucose in the lumen of the small intestine may determine which enterotoxin is maximally expressed. In addition, our results suggest that the host may also modulate enterotoxin expression because cells intoxicated with heat-labile toxin overproduce and release cAMP...|$|R

The centers of a subset of spheres identified as medial (touching at least two boundaries) are connected to identify the interior of a particular anatomical structure.
