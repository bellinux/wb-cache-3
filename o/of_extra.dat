5|$|Liverpool {{kicked off}} the first half <b>of</b> <b>extra</b> time. Pirlo had a chance in the early stages, but he put his shot over the crossbar. Tomasson came close in the later stages of the first period <b>of</b> <b>extra</b> time, {{but he could not}} make contact with the ball. Vladimír Šmicer {{required}} treatment for cramp {{towards the end of the}} first period, as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan make their final substitution replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa. The best chance of the second half came near the end when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved only for it to rebound back out to Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek again saved by pushing the shot over the bar.

Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal.

Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} <b>of</b> <b>extra</b> time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield.
