For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in personal evangelism, probably speaking with more than 100,000 people in total. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> became a Christian after encountering Jenner's question was Noel Stanton, who went on to found the Jesus Army in 1969.|$|E

The tour included the session players Gary Windo and Ann Sheldon, {{as well as the}} keyboard player Ed Buller. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> did not come with them was Vince Ely, whose long-simmering dissatisfaction with the band finally led to his departure, just after the album's recording was completed. Ely was replaced as drummer by Phill Calvert, formerly of The Birthday Party.|$|E

All {{operations}} were flown by North Flying, who operate a 19-seat Fairchild Metro 23 in Air Norway livery. The municipality subsidised the route with NOK1 million per year. The company had {{a managing director}} in a 20% position, plus <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> coordinated booking on an hourly basis. In 2008, the airline had a revenue of NOK16 million and made NOK800,000 in profit. Ørland Airport is the civilian section of the military Ørland Main Air Station. Traditionally, the main customer group for Air Norway was military personnel.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> <b>who</b> became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} his admirers hoped {{that he would}} be {{revealed}} as the Messiah. Admirers pointed to traditional Jewish theology which teaches that in every generation there is <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> is worthy of being the Messiah, and if God deems the times right, he will be revealed by God as such. Chabad followers also pointed to a tradition that in every generation there is <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> is considered the Messiah of the generation.|$|E
