40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut citrus fruits acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties <b>of</b> Garut <b>citrus</b> fruits were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut citrus fruits acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity <b>of</b> Garut <b>citrus</b> fruits. The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight <b>of</b> Garut <b>citrus</b> fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight <b>of</b> the Garut <b>citrus</b> fruits increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining <b>of</b> Garut <b>citrus</b> acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E

5|$|While {{crossing}} Cuba, Lili primarily caused {{damage from}} its heavy rainfall {{and not from}} the winds. Nationwide, Lili damaged 92,542houses and destroyed another 6,369, mostly in Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus, which left thousands of people homeless. Heavy rains caused homes to collapse along the path, many already in poor condition. On Isla de la Juventud, the winds damaged 85houses and destroyed another 103. The winds also stripped 16tons of grapefruit from their trees on the island. Nationwide, {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees fell during the storm. On Cayo Largo del Sur, the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas. In Villa Clara Province, about 45mi (75km) of roads were damaged, and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28sugar refineries. In Havana, the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees. Nationwide, the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines, leaving many towns without power, and power plants were damaged in Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces. The hurricane also damaged 21hospitals and dozens of health clinics, along with 32schools. Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm's path, affecting thousands of hectares of arable land, and damaging 105agricultural facilities. Flooding affected the banana, fruit, coffee, sugar cane, and rice crops. Nationwide, the storm damaged about 25,406hectares of bananas and 686,893hectares of sugar cane, along with 36,249hectares of other crops. In Sancti Espíritu, 28,000tons of rice were wrecked, and in Matanzas, 7,500tons <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> crops were heavily damaged. Total damages in the country were estimated at $362million (1996 USD). There were no deaths in Cuba, and seven injuries.|$|E
