2500|$|In 1796, Lefroy began a flirtation with English novelist Jane Austen, who was {{a friend}} of an older female relative. Jane Austen wrote two letters to her sister Cassandra {{mentioning}} [...] "Tom Lefroy", and some have suggested that it may have been he whom Austen had in mind when she invented the character of Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, as the courtship between Tom Lefroy and Jane Austen took place over the year <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Pride and Prejudice was written. In his 2003 biography, Becoming Jane Austen, Jon Spence suggests that Jane Austen actually used her and Tom LeFroy's personalities as the models for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, but not in an expected way. Spence suggests that Jane Austen used Tom Lefroy's more gregarious personality as the model for the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennet, and her own measured demeanor was used as the model for the male protagonist, Mr. Darcy. So while the exact influence of Tom Lefroy on Pride and Prejudice continues to be debated, it does seem certain that his presence in Austen's life is in some way reflected in the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Juan Seguín {{stated that}} with him, 15 men also entered {{to defend the}} Alamo. Lindley {{believes}} that the Flores brothers were defending the Alamo during the siege.

His brother Manuel, and other Tejanos (15) entered on February 23. Neill's roster places Captain Flores in the Alamo as an artillery officer. Captain Flores also appears on Colonel Neill's voting tally, as well. Somehow, they seem to have exited soon after Seguin's departure, thus putting them on the Alamo survivor list. In 1907, Enrique Esparza claimed that Santa Anna called an armistice and he remembers some Flores leaving then. [...] They took this opportunity to gather Alamo reinforcements, bringing along a couple more of the Flores brothers (according to Seguin, they had a Tejano force of 100 when they regrouped in Gonzales), and secure their families (having not been seen, since abruptly entering the Alamo). They then rendezvoused with Seguin, now in Gonzales. [...] The company headed for the Alamo. The Tejano defenders were joined by up to fourteen more men from Gonzales (led by former Alamo couriers Alsbury and Sutherland). They proceeded toward the Alamo. There they waited on the Cibolo Creek to team up with Fannin. The Alamo fell before they could reach it.|$|E
