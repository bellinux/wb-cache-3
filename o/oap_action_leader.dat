40|$|The human {{ability to}} perform joint actions is often {{attributed}} to high-level cognitive processes. For example, the finding that <b>action</b> <b>leaders</b> act faster when imitated by their partners has been interpreted as evidence for anticipation of the other’s actions (Pfister, Dignath, Hommel, & Kunde, 2013). In two experiments, we showed that a low-level mechanism can account for this finding. <b>Action</b> <b>leaders</b> were faster when imitated than when counterimitated, {{but only if they}} could observe their partner’s actions (Exp. 1). Crucially, when due to our manipulation the partner’s imitative actions became slower than the counterimitative <b>actions,</b> <b>leaders</b> also became slower when they were imitated, and faster when counterimitated (Exp. 2). Our results suggest that spontaneous temporal adaptation is a key mechanism in joint action tasks. We argue for a reconsideration of other phenomena that have traditionally been attributed solely to high-level processes...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} paper investigates barriers influencing leadership {{within a}} contextual perspective. Leadership theory is extended to barriers within contextualisation of leadership. The {{purpose of the}} paper is to explore leadership barriers within the rich contextual dynamic in three South-East Asian/Pacific countries. Researchers continue to call for greater understanding of leadership within particular contexts. However,barriers and context remain little understood. This paper explores multiple contextual barriers to leadership impacting on leadership, rather than viewing barriers as specific factors, events or phenomenon. Data were drawn from ongoing leadership studies in Malaysia, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and the extant literature. Results suggest that understanding barriers and their influence is important as they affect leadership <b>actions.</b> <b>Leaders</b> are able to develop greater {{understanding and appreciation of}} barriers, and concepts underpinning leadership, and the value of resulting outcomes of leadership <b>actions.</b> <b>Leaders,</b> in any context, are subject to external and internal barriers, and are not uniform across all contexts. Studies such as this are useful in extending our understanding of leadership beyond a universal point-of-view by offering an insight into an integrated perspective of leadership that recognises differences within particular contexts. Many leadership studies overlook the importance and contribution of barriers to leadership, particularly within country specific contexts. This study engages that need...|$|R

It eschews the hierarchical structure {{usually associated with}} leadership and is based instead on the democratic values of freedom, equality, inclusion and self-realization. It take responsibility for, not control over, people through networking and orchestrating human energy towards a holistic outcome that benefits the common interest. <b>Action</b> <b>leaders</b> are passionate people who abide by the motto that "Learning does not mean to fill a barrel but rather to ignite a flame" in others. And {{in this time of}} rapid economic, political, technological, social and ecological changes, action leadership and <b>action</b> <b>leaders</b> are precisely what's needed to improve how people and organizations engage constructively to address the myriad complex issues challenging society at all levels.

It addresses real-life issues by people who choose to work collaboratively towards shared goals while developing their learning, insights, knowledge, people skills and personal relationships through involvement in a PALAR project. The book provides a conceptual framework for action leadership and for the integrative, practical theory of PALAR; and examples of applications in higher education, management education for organization development, and community development.
