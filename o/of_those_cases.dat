5|$|Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 {{criminal}} cases {{were brought in}} the circuit courts, and 56 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 {{criminal cases}} were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in guilty verdicts by juries; 479, not guilty verdicts by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E

5|$|During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up {{residence}} in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught {{to read and write}} at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.|$|E

The six cases raised by the U.S. delegation in the Binational Commission meetings illustrate the delays in cases when {{the location of the}} child is not known and/or an amparo appeal (a provision of the Mexican Constitution where a claim is made that a civil right has been violated) is filed. There has been progress in one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{alliance}} with the American Federation of Labor, the NAACP led the successful fight to prevent the nomination of John Johnston Parker to the Supreme Court, based on his support for denying the vote to blacks and his anti-labor rulings. It organized legal support for the Scottsboro Boys. The NAACP lost most of the internecine battles with the Communist Party and International Labor Defense over the control <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> and the legal strategy to be pursued in that case.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, a {{research}} institute {{affiliated with the}} Supreme Court issued a report on application {{of the death penalty}} from 1980 to 2009. The study found that, while prosecutors very rarely demand capital punishment in cases of single murder, it was handed down in 32% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b> On the other hand, prosecutors seek the death penalty almost systematically in cases of multiple homicide, and it is handed down in 59% of cases of double-murder and 79% of cases where three or more victims have been killed.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{implementing}} legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system remains a problem. The amparo (a special appeal claiming {{a violation of}} constitutional rights) {{has been used by}} taking parents to block Hague proceedings indefinitely. Six cases still active 18 months after filing had one or more amparos and 3 <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> currently have amparos pending. One of the four cases resolved through the Convention process since the 2001 Report was published resulted in the denial of a return by the Mexican Supreme Court because six years had passed while the taking parent filed successive amparos after the original judge ordered the children returned.|$|E
25|$|He {{was convicted}} of several murders, and {{received}} six life sentences, {{as well as the}} death sentence. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and Vernon Jordan Jr., the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases.</b> Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the sets}} in the episode {{were created by}} Corey Kaplan. Roe, meanwhile, {{was in charge of}} the cinematography. Spotnitz complimented Rob Bowman's {{direction}} in this episode. However, he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel, reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice. He explained, [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> where you just run out of time, sorry to say". He later expressed a desire to one day go back and amend the effect.|$|E
500|$|According to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are {{produced}} incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations {{only if they}} do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: [...] "The wheel may be one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [...] {{the other side of a}} deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable." [...] In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable [...] "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that [...] "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases,</b> the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

[...] The Hollywood Reporter's critic Todd McCarthy said: [...] "It would have helped if director Nick Cassavetes had something resembling a sure hand at comedy." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film grade C-, saying [...] "All of a sudden, a spotted Great Dane squats {{in the middle of}} a Manhattan apartment and out plop several gleaming, glistening CGI turds. It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>cases</b> where a Hollywood movie inadvertently summarizes itself in a single shot." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Line to line, it's fresher than any number of guy-centric [...] "Hangover"-spawned affairs, despite director Cassavetes' lack of flair for slapstick." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film one out of four stars and said, [...] "It's [...] "The First Wives Club" [...] rewritten for younger, less demanding audiences, or a [...] "9 to 5" [...] with absolutely nothing at stake."

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a dynamic {{variant of the}} traditional ABC storage policy. The variant {{is to be used}} in manual order picking warehouses where SKUs experience a rather unstable demand. Its objective is to reduce the order picking time.

A few case studies based on computer simulations have shown that this variant can yield interesting time savings if its parameters are chosen with care. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>case</b> studies is presented in this paper. Because of the pioneering nature of this variant, some ideas for further research are also sketched...|$|R
