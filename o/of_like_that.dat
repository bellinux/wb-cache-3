Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as [...] "poseurs" [...] "who pretended {{to be part of the}} subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".|$|E
500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was clearly on the positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E

I can only say that I am very sorry,"-- which indeed he was--"and that I should never have taken any notice of his words--knowing that he would regret them on reflection--had he not in an {{unguarded}} moment allowed himself to taunt me with my birth. Uncle, you know the misfortune of my father's marriage, and that she was not his equal in birth, but you know too that she was my mother and I love her memory though I never saw her, and I could not bear to hear her spoken <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and I struck him. I hope that both you and he will forgive me; I cannot say any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|That last, indeed, [...] "Gil Blas" [...] is; a {{collection}} of diseased specimens. No man or woman in the book, lay or clerical, gentle or simple, as far as I can remember, do their duty in any wise, even if they recollect that they have any duty to do. Greed, chicane, hypocrisy, uselessness are the ruling laws of human society. A new book of Ecclesiastes, crying, [...] "Vanity of vanity, all is vanity;" [...] the [...] "conclusion of the whole matter" [...] being left out, and the new Ecclesiastes rendered thereby diabolic, instead <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> old one, divine. For, instead of [...] "Fear God and keep his commandments, for that is the whole duty of main," [...] Le Sage sends forth the new conclusion, [...] "Take care of thyself, and feed on thy neighbours, for that is the whole duty of man." [...] And very faithfully was his advice (easy enough to obey at all times) obeyed {{for nearly a century}} after [...] "Gil Blas" [...] appeared.|$|E

6000|$|Mitchy still {{accepted}} the prophecy only to control it. [...] "Do you call eighty middle life?

5000|$|Interviewer: How was the swirly {{effect at}} the end of [...] "When the Levee Breaks" [...] achieved? I always imagine you sitting there with a {{joystick}} ... Page: It's sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> isn't it? It's interesting: On [...] "Levee Breaks" [...] you've got backwards harmonica, backwards echo, phasing, and there's also flanging; and {{at the end}}, you get this super-dense sound, in layers, that's all built around the drum track. And you've got Robert, constant in the middle, and everything starts to spiral around him. It's all done with panning.|$|E
5000|$|British {{comic book}} writer Warren Ellis {{considered}} Brokencyde's [...] "FreaXXX" [...] music video [...] "a near-perfect snapshot of everything that’s shit about {{this point in}} the culture". A writer for the Warsaw Business Journal attempted to describe their music: [...] "Imagine an impassioned triceratops mating with a steam turbine, while off to the side Daft Punk and the Bee Gees beat each other to death with skillets and spatulas. Imagine the sound that would make. Just try. BrokeNCYDE is kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> except it also makes you want to jab your thumbs into your eyeballs and gargle acid." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The character's {{evolution}} {{over the}} season hasn't really surprised me,' he continues. 'I've been excited {{about what the}} writers have written for him, but it wasn't really surprising. I figured {{that was the only}} way he could go, which was to become a little bit lighter. Once in a while I kind of like it that he thinks he's got a place in life, that this is his journey and he's going to follow that journey, no questions asked. He's going to question everything else and defy all authority. I kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> because even when he doesn't want to do something, I figured he would go against his heart and do what he felt he was meant to do. In one sense it's admirable, but in another it's kind of ignorant and stupid. I kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> loyalty on his part, but that's slowly going to be broken down with the relationship with Maria and Max and Isabel, which will force him to kind of embrace the human side of life more. That's going to be the real ultimate struggle for him. I don't think you can ride the fence on that one; you're going to have to fully embrace your alienhood or kind of go the other way, and I don't think, mentally for the health of the character, that he can just stay with his alienhood. Overall, I think a choice will have to be made and that's what he'll struggle with." [...] Brendan Fehr, from [...] "Roswell: Brendan Fehr" [...] by Edward Gross ...|$|E
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Portland, Oregon, Trautmann started playing along to records when he was 11 or 12. “The KISS Halloween special was sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> moment of clarity that told me I wanted to be {{involved}} and I {{had to do this}} for a living,” he says. He began playing in punk bands in high school and eventually joined a group called The Miracle Workers, who were dedicated to reviving the first-generation punk of mid-’60s garage bands like the Sonics and the Count Five. After graduating in 1985 from Oregon Episcopal School, he followed the band to Los Angeles and played with it on several albums, in addition to touring the U.S. and Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Kenneth Cole's {{socially}} conscious advertising for the causes that he champions can be somewhat controversial. One such example was {{his campaign for}} World AIDS Day in 2005. He designed T-shirts for the campaign which were sold at such stores as Barneys New York, Scoop, and Louis Boston. The messages on the shirts stated either, [...] "We All Have AIDS" [...] or [...] "I Have AIDS." [...] Cole created the shirts in hopes that those with or without AIDS would wear the shirts, to help diminish the stigma attached to the disease. Cole stated, [...] "There is a legend of the Danish king, Christian X, who, during World War II, when Hitler insisted all Jews publicly wear a yellow Star of David, would wear the star himself, hence {{making it difficult to}} differentiate who was Jewish. This is kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> hopefully." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album is}} {{described}} by music critics as pop and EDM. According to Mahone, the sound {{is a mixture of}} pop, R&B, electronic dance and 90's Backstreet Boys. When asked about the EP in an interview with MTV News, he said that the songs in his upcoming album would [...] "sound like [...] "What About Love" [...] kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> EDM, like I said, old school/new school." [...] Writing for So So Gay, David Lim noted the EP's sound to be influenced by Swedish pop producer Max Martin, who created songs for late-90's teen pop stars such as Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. Lim later went on to call the EP a [...] "shout of neon-bright tunes" [...] and said: [...] "The catchy melodies and electronic beats suit Austin’s own clean-cut, all singing-and-dancing persona, but at times it puts a wall between him and the listener." ...|$|E
5000|$|Funhouse Lounge is a venue and bar in {{southeast}} Portland, Oregon's Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood, in the United States. The venue hosts comedy and theatre performances, including [...] "Comic Strip", a monthly event in which comedians strip during their stand-up routines. Funhouse has also hosted productions of Reefer Madness and The Rocky Horror Show. Thrillist contributor Amy Wolfenberger included Funhouse in her list of [...] "The Best Theme Bars in Portland", {{in which she}} wrote: [...] "The Funhouse is a wonderland of improv theater, beer, shots (no cocktails), clowns, and a general sense of whimsy. On any given night, you can get anything from stand-up to improvised episodes of Deadwood ... to burlesque. It's kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> scene in Fear & Loathing, only with fewer trapeze-friendly wolverines and more grown-up theater kids. Oh, and it's situated just across Ladd's Addition from legendary comic shop Excalibur, {{just in case you}} wanted to incorporate more capes into your fandom for the evening." ...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{publicity}} of Unclaimed, {{the identity of}} the man who claimed to be Robertson was challenged. In the documentary, the Toronto Star reported the case made, [...] "There is physical proof of Robertson's birthplace, collected in dramatic fashion onscreen; a tearful meeting in Vietnam with a soldier who was trained by Robertson in 1960 and said he knew him on sight; and a heart-wrenching reunion with his only surviving sister — 80-year-old Jean Robertson-Holly sic." [...] Leading up to the film's premiere, Jorgensen said Robertson's American wife and two children had volunteered to participate in DNA testing but withdrew their intent. The filmmaker said, [...] "Somebody suggested to me maybe that's (because) the daughters don't want to know if it's him. It's kind <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> was an ugly war. It was a long time ago. We just want it to go away... I don't know. What would compel you not to want to know if this person is your biological father?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Reginald Lamar Williams, Jr {{was born}} in Bradenton, FL on January 18, 1990. According to Williams, much of his {{upbringing}} was characterized by difficult relationships with both his family and peers. At the age of 5, William’s parents got a divorce leading to relationships with his mother, father, and sisters he describes as “tenuous.” In an Uproxx mini-documentary from May 2015, he recalls asking his parents for a guitar to which they responded with laughter.Although still legally under his parent’s care, Williams {{spent most of his}} teen years sleeping at friend’s houses. William recalls struggling to fit in with other black youth telling Rolling Stone, [...] "I was fat and couldn't play basketball, and I wanted to listen to Linkin Park, and only the white kids at my school wanted to do that stuff, and it's kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Earl Sweatshirt line: 'Too white for the black kids, too black for the whites.' You're stuck in that shitty middle ground. So for a long time I just pretended to be into all the shit they were into.|$|E
5000|$|Robinson further {{commented on}} the {{recording}} process of Flux, remarking: [...] "On my last record, The Ceaseless Sight, I didn’t have as many songs. I had a few songs and parts of other songs and I {{wanted to use the}} studio to finish them. I liked the way it turned out, so for this record I said I’m not going to finish anything. You can have parts of songs and sit on them for a while, but when you’re in the studio you have a finite amount of time and you have to get in and finish them. There’s an urgency and I kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> pressure. It forces you to make creative decisions on {{how this is going to}} turn out. So that’s how I went in. I love the fact that it’s a very eclectic record and that it draws from all of my influences. It takes you on a journey and that’s what records should do. I look at the record as a whole. What I feel when I hear this record is that I’m in a different place for every song. I get inside this place and then the next song comes and I’m in a different place and I really like that. It’s really interesting to go with the music and where it takes you." ...|$|E
