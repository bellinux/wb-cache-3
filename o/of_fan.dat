5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure <b>of</b> <b>fan</b> blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} psychological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> associated with self-reported attempts to approach celebrities. Two hundred undergraduate students (100 male, 100 female) completed a questionnaire {{consisting of the}} Experi-ences in Close Relationships-Revised questionnaire (Fraley, Waller, & Bren-nan, 2000) and a scale measuring frequency of self-reported attempts to contact a favourite celebrity. Multiple regression revealed a statistically significant positive association between attachment related anxiety, and a negative asso-ciation between attachment related avoidance {{and the frequency of}} self re-ported approach behaviour towards a celebrity, which is consistent with a pre-occupied attachment style. The implications of these findings for theories of stalking and harassment of celebrities are discussed. This study investigated the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> towards celebri-ties, with particular interest in determining the associations be-tween psychological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> and their self-reported attempts to contact and/or approach their favourite celebrity.

5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation <b>of</b> <b>fan</b> vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E
