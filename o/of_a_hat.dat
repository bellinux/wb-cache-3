25|$|On 1 March 1901 the Australian Army {{was formed}} {{following}} {{the transfer of}} colonial forces. Universal service dress was introduced in 1902 and was worn at all times, including in the field, except for formal occasions requiring full dress. This uniform included a peaked cap, tunic, and trousers, with officers wearing a Sam Browne belt. Officers of the mounted arm wore breeches and boots, while the rest worn puttees. The different arms and corps were distinguished by the colour of the braid trimming on the shoulder straps. A wide-brimmed slouch hat was worn with one side turned up by troops overseas. The rising sun badge was first worn at this time by battalions of the Australian Commonwealth Horse on active service in South Africa, while some Queensland units wore emu plumes in their hats. During this period it remained common to follow the British system, with the uniform subsequently adopted by the Commonwealth consisting of a General Service Dress which, {{in order to achieve}} financial savings, could be converted into Full Dress for ceremonial occasions simply by the addition of a number of lace accoutrements, including aiguillettes, as well as breast-lines and girdles. The uniform consisted of a khaki serge jacket, with slouch hat and breeches. Cloth collar patches were worn, as well as coloured piping on the jacket, with rosettes or plumes on the hat, and regimental badges. The introduction of universal service in 1912 resulted in the adoption of a number of changes due to the need to economise following the rapid expansion of the Army. The uniform provide for at this time was relatively simple, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hat,</b> heavy woollen khaki shirt, cord breeches and boots. To distinguish between units and corps a coloured cloth hat band with a metal numeral was worn. Officers kept their jackets, and later approval was given to wear open collars with shirt and tie.|$|E
