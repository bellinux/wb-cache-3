40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth in high-stakes testing in recent decades, we have {{witnessed}} the phenomenon of large groups of test takers investing increasing amounts of time, resources and energy on test preparation. Their goal is to achieve scores that {{will enable them to}} make life defining choices. For many of them, I have discovered that test preparation requires engaging in pressurised practice to achieve a high score rather than engaging in meaningful learning. This research has found the test preparation experience to be a critical experience that impacts on an individual’s life. Until now, we have not known why and how learners prepare to take tests, nor how they construct their identities as test takers, or are constructed by the test preparation. One objective of this study is therefore to examine Korean test takers’ preparation practices for English-speaking proficiency tests from the test takers’ perspectives. The second major objective is to examine how the act of test preparation affects test takers’ identity. The qualitative methodology adopted to investigate these issues included interviews with test takers and <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> preparation classes in Korea. The data were analysed using coding and thematic categorisation. It was found that test takers tended to study in cram schools, and that preparation was dependent upon instructors and the test for which they were preparing. The study revealed a complex situation with regard to identity construction, related to: (1) personal goal and test preparation choice, (2) English mediated identity in speaking activities and (3) self-conflicts over time. It is suggested that the impact of test preparation on a test taker’s identity may be devaluation of a sense of self.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{successive}} appearance of a distinct set of test morphologies by planktic foraminifera represents evidence for the multiple evolution of mechanical optima (Steineck and Fleisher, 1978). However, morphometric, isotopic and biostratigraphic analyses of the globigerine species Subbotina linaperta from Middle-Late Eocene Atlantic Ocean deep sea cores suggests that changes in developmental pathways may also {{play an important role in}} planktic foraminiferal evolution. During a period of prolonged and global change in the Middle-Late Eocene marine environment, at least one western Atlantic population of S. linaperta was characterized by a marked decrease in mean test size that persisted throughout the remainder of this species' teilzone. In addition, this Late Eocene population exhibited anomalous relative abundances and a pronounced change in depth habitat when compared to conspecific populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. Quantitative morphometric analyses indicate the observed size reduction to be a secondary result of selection for the ontogenetically accelerated attainment of sexual maturity; a mode of developmentally mediated evolution termed progenesis. The temporal persistence of this progenetically dwarfed population throughout the remainder of the Late Eocene at this locality serves to illustrate the potential of this evolutionary mechanism to produce sustained morphological and ecological changes within populations of marine plankton as well as implying that this population was at least partially isolated from the general circulation of the Gulf Stream during this time interval. In addition, similarities between the nature of phenotypic change in this population and the common anecdotal <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> size reduction in a number of planktic foraminiferal lineages at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and during the Paleogene-Neogene faunal transition suggest that selection for different developmental patterns may provide an alternative explanation for the reappearance of simple globigerine morphotypes after major planktic foraminiferal extinction events...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies large-scale multiple testing {{which plays}} an important role in many areas of modern science and technology, such as biomedical imaging and genomic data processing. It has long been recognized that statistical dependence in data poses a significant challenge to large-scale multiple testing. Failure to take the dependence into account can result in severe drop in performance of multiple testing. In particular, the detection power of large-scale multiple tests is known to suffer under dependence when the False Discovery Proportion must be controlled. However, it often happens that the dependence structure is unknown and only a single, albeit very high-dimensional, <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> statistic is available. This makes large scale multiple testing under dependence considerably harder. This situation can be likened to a signal processing problem with the truth/falsehood of a hypothesis playing the role of an unobservable binary signal and hypothesis-testing becomes analogous to signal detection. To complete the analogy, the signals have an unknown statistical dependence and the test-statistics are the dependent noise-corrupted observations. The typical total number of simultaneous hypotheses in this work can be between a thousand and a million. The target application context is that of large scale `preliminary sieving 2 ̆ 7, using noisy observations, with the goal of reducing the scale of the problem for further examination. Likewise, the detection of extremely sparse signals lies outside the scope of this work. Our work addresses this problem for the case of a stationary, ergodic signal vector with low signal-strength, a known noise distribution and a known signal-noise interaction-function. This case has many potential applications as signals embedded in data can often be characterized as a stationary ergodic process with an unknown distribution, while the distribution of the noise that distorts the signals can be accurately inferred beforehand under controlled experiments. Our main contribution in this setting is a new approach for improved recovery of a long sequence of dependent binary signals embedded in noisy observations. The novel aspect of our approach is the approximation and numerical computation of the posterior probabilities of binary signals at individual sites of the process, by drawing strength from observations at nearby sites without assuming the availability of their joint prior distribution. Although we only consider signal vectors registered as a time series, the approach in principle may apply to random fields as well. A problem closely related to multiple testing under arbitrary dependence is the simulation of random transition matrices. This problem is motivated by the need for `random 2 ̆ 7 Markov chains in the study on multiple testing. Random transition matrices can also be used to simulate random contingency tables, models of real-world networks, and other high-dimensional data with versatile dependence structures. For example, simulating random stochastic matrices with a specified principal eigenvector or a specified spectral gap facilitates the simulation of markov chains with specified stationary distribution or mixing-time respectively. The exact-simulation problem is known to be hard and consequently simple recipes for the exact simulation of such random matrices, even from a uniform distribution, are unavailable. We use known results to suggest simple heuristics to simulate, from an unknown distribution, stochastic matrices that have a prescribed principal left eigenvector and/or approximately a prescribed spectral gap. The unifying theme that pervades this dissertation is that of unknown dependence structure in high-dimensional data...|$|E

To avoid the potential inconsistency with other observational data, we take the best-fitting dark energy model constrained by the current observations as the fiducial model to produce 30 mock SL test data. The SL test data provide an important supplement to the other dark energy probes, since they are extremely helpful in breaking the existing parameter degeneracies. We show that the strong degeneracy between Ω_m and H_ 0 in all the three dark energy models is well broken by the SL test. Compared to the current combined data of type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, and Hubble constant, the 30 -yr <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> SL <b>test</b> could improve the constraints on Ω_m and H_ 0 by more than 60 % for all the three models.
