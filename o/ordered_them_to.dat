5|$|Just before midnight, 120–135 marines {{arrived at}} the station and {{reported}} to the governor, who <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> set about capturing {{the leaders of the}} mob. Governor Carroll telegraphed and advised President Hayes that order had been restored in the city.|$|E

5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue forward.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Mansour {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} on December 29, 1982, pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position. Archbishop Szoka hardened his resolve, on February 23, 1983, directed the Detroit Province of the Sisters of Mercy {{to determine whether}} Mansour was {{in violation of the}} teachings of the Church. He told the Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state, and he <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> inform her that she was to resign the state appointment.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnamese {{attention}} then {{shifted to}} Ranger South, where 400 South Vietnamese troops, including the 109 survivors of Ranger North, held the outpost {{for another two}} days before General Lãm <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fight their way five kilometers southeast to FSB 30. Another casualty of the battle, although an indirect one, was South Vietnamese General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of III Corps and hero of the Cambodian campaign. Ordered by President Thieu to take over for the outclassed Lãm, Trí died in a helicopter crash on 23 February while en route to his new command.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} {{the landing}} at Gallipoli, 25 April 1915, Godley came ashore on Gallipoli at midday. Consulting with Major General William Bridges that afternoon, Godley was of the view that the Allied forces, dealing with stiffer than {{expected}} resistance, should be evacuated ahead of an expected attack by Turkish forces the next morning. Although Bridges agreed with Godley, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, Sir Ian Hamilton, <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> hold fast.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order. Mayor Shank supported the police mutiny and their refusal to protect the streetcars. He insisted that the situation required Governor Ralston to take action. Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair fuse boxes, which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> follow Blake, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> remain where they are, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, <b>ordering</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fix a fuse box.|$|R

5|$|Within minutes Calypso {{had also}} veered its cable so that Italienne, now beached, could resume {{fire on the}} British squadron, but the frigate overcompensated and drifted stern-first onto the shore. The British ships {{continued}} their fire until the rapidly falling tide forced them to retire one by one, with Defiance being the last to retire at 12:15. The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final shots fired by Donegal, before Stopford <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the siege}} began, Skanderbeg exited Krujë with 8,000 men—among whom were many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans. 2,000 {{of these were}} {{infantry}} and 6,000 were cavalry. Skanderbeg found Mount Tumenishta (now known as Mount Skënderbeu) to be a suitable position from which to attack the Ottomans. Krujë was left with a garrison of 4,000 men {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their positions. Krujë had enough supplies for a sixteen-month siege. The women and children of Krujë were sent for protection to Venetian possessed cities, whereas the others were ordered to burn their crops and move into the mountains and fortresses.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's {{body was}} simply left behind {{at the site}} of his execution. One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers brought it to Warwick, who refused to accept it, and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take it back outside his jurisdiction. Eventually, a group of Dominican friars brought it to Oxford. A proper burial could not be {{arranged}} while Gaveston was still excommunicate, and it was not until 2 January 1315, after the King had secured a papal absolution for his favourite, that he could have his body buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Dominican foundation of King's Langley Priory; the tomb is now lost. In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E
5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Pembroke lodged his {{prisoner}} in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, {{in the presence}} of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take it back to where they found it. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely <b>ordered</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
