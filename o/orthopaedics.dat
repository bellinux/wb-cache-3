40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{or domestic}} {{violence is a}} common and serious public health problem around the globe.

This thesis originated from the lack of understanding of IPV in <b>orthopaedic</b> patients as well as the desire to develop a program for <b>orthopaedic</b> surgeons to assist IPV victims presenting to <b>orthopaedic</b> fracture clinics.

25|$|During the First World War, Jones {{served as}} a Territorial Army surgeon.

The hospital in Ducane Road, Hammersmith became the model for both British and American military orthopedic hospitals.

25|$|One of his {{earliest}} contributions {{while at the}} Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in <b>orthopaedics,</b> {{by means of the}} development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Globally, {{injuries}} cause approximately as many {{deaths per}} year as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and 90 % of injury deaths occur in low- and middle- income countries. Given not all injuries kill, the disability burden, particularly from <b>orthopaedic</b> injuries, {{is much higher}} but is poorly measured at present. The <b>orthopaedic</b> services and <b>orthopaedic</b> medical devices needed to manage the injury burden are frequently unavailable in these countries. Corruption {{is known to be}} a major barrier to access of health care, but its effects on access to <b>orthopaedic</b> services is still unknown. Methods A qualitative case study of 45 open-ended interviews was conducted to investigate the access to <b>orthopaedic</b> health services and <b>orthopaedic</b> medical devices in Uganda. Participants included <b>orthopaedic</b> surgeons, related healthcare professionals, industry and government representatives, and patients. Participants’ experiences in accessing <b>orthopaedic</b> medical devices were explored. Thematic analysis was used to analyze and code the transcripts. Results Analysis of the interview data identified poor leadership in government and corruption as major barriers to access of <b>orthopaedic</b> care and <b>orthopaedic</b> medical devices. Corruption was perceived to occur at the worker, hospital and government levels in the forms of misappropriation of funds, theft of equipment, resale of drugs and medical devices, fraud and absenteeism. Other barriers elicited included insufficient health infrastructure and human resources, and high costs of <b>orthopaedic</b> equipment and poverty. Conclusions This study identified perceived corruption as a significant barrier to access of <b>orthopaedic</b> care and <b>orthopaedic</b> medical devices in Uganda. As the burden of injury continues to grow, the need to combat corruption and ensure access to <b>orthopaedic</b> services is imperative. Anti-corruption strategies such as transparency and accountability measures, codes of conduct, whistleblower protection, and higher wages and benefits for workers could be important and initial steps in improving access <b>orthopaedic</b> care and OMDs, and managing the global injury burden. </p...|$|R

25|$|In most medical programs, {{the first}} two years deal with basic {{scientific}} courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In {{the first two}} years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include {{but are not limited to}} internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, <b>orthopaedics,</b> gynaecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools. This is important in terms of the medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.|$|E
