40|$|We propose {{and study}} a {{flexible}} modeling {{framework for the}} joint dynamics of an index {{and a set of}} forward variance swap rates written on this index, allowing <b>options</b> <b>on</b> forward variance swaps and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> the underlying index to be priced consistently. Our model reproduces various empirically observed properties of variance swap dynamics and allows for jumps in volatility and returns. An affine specification using L´evy processes as building blocks leads to analytically tractable pricing formulas for <b>options</b> <b>on</b> variance swaps as well as efficient numerical methods for pricing of European <b>options</b> <b>on</b> the underlying asset. The model has the convenient feature of decoupling the vanilla skews from spot/volatility correlations and allowing for different conditional correlations in large and small spot/volatility moves. We show that our model can simultaneously fit prices of European <b>options</b> <b>on</b> S&P 500 across strikes and maturities as well as <b>options</b> <b>on</b> the VIX volatility index. The calibration of the model is done in two steps, first by matching VIX option prices and then by matching prices of <b>options</b> <b>on</b> the underlyingNo keywords;...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a numerically accurate and computationally fast approximation to {{the prices of}} European <b>options</b> <b>on</b> coupon-bearing instruments that is applicable to the entire family of affine term structure models. Exploiting the typical shapes of the conditional distributions of the risk factors in affine diffusions, we show that one can reliably compute the relevant probabilities needed for pricing <b>options</b> <b>on</b> coupon-bearing instruments by the same Fourier inversion methods used in the pricing of <b>options</b> <b>on</b> zero-coupon bonds. We apply our theoretical results to the pricing of <b>options</b> <b>on</b> coupon bonds and swaptions, and the calculation of "expected exposures" on swap books. As an empirical illustration, we compute the expected exposures implied by several affine term structure models fit to historical swap yields. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a modified constant elasticity of variance (MCEV) model. This model uses the familiar constant elasticity of variance {{form for the}} volatility of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) in a continuous market.

This paper derives analytic real-world prices for zero-coupon bonds, instantaneous forward rates and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> the GOP that are both theoretically revealing and computationally efficient. In addition, the paper examines <b>options</b> <b>on</b> exchange prices and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> zero-coupon bonds under the MCEV model.
