40|$|The "freezing {{rotation}} illusion" {{refers to}} decrease in perceived {{speed of a}} continuously rotating central region when a swaying surround co-rotates. We observed the following effects for rotations: First, when the centre and its surround are turning in the same direction, and their velocities are distinguishable, <b>the</b> perceived speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre is lower than its physical speed. Second, when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> and <b>the</b> centre are counter-rotating, <b>the</b> perceived speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre is enhanced. Third, even when <b>the</b> surface size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre matches <b>the</b> surface size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> swaying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre is unable to induce significant changes in <b>the</b> perceived speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> whereas swaying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> still induces changes in <b>the</b> perceived speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe used {{binocular}} rivalry as a psychophysical probe to explore center-surround interactions in orientation, motion and color processing. Addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> matching one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rival targets dramatically altered rivalry dynamics. For all visual sub-modalities tested, predominance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-contrast rival target matched to <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> was greatly reduced—a result that disappeared at low contrast. At low contrast, addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> boosted dominance <b>of</b> orientation and motion targets matched to <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> This contrast-dependent modulation of center-surround interactions {{seems to be}} a general property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual system and may reflect an adaptive balance between surround suppression and spatial summation...|$|R
