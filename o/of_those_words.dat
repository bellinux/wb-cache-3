25|$|Although the {{existence}} of dictionaries and encyclopedias spanned into ancient times, and would be nothing new to Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> in 18th-century encyclopedic dictionaries. The works {{were part of an}} Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers’ tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on secular affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of theology.|$|E

Through words {{and language}}, Smart attempted to capture the creative power <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words.</b> By relying on the power of words, Smart is, according to Clement Hawes, subverting [...] "Anglican control over religious functions and services." [...] In essence, Smart's approach to religion in Jubilate Agno is comparable to John Wesley's theological dictum and to the writings of John Perro and William Bowling. He also creates his own natural philosophy and criticises science, like that established by Isaac Newton, for their ignoring [...] "the glory of Almighty God." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{itself was}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the hip hop albums of the century" [...] by the British newspaper The Observer and was successful on European music charts. Other reviews have been positive; Matthew Pollesel of Splendid Magazine praised the album for its lyrical content: [...] "...as Daara J show throughout Boomerang, it's possible to get the meaning <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> just by listening {{to the things that}} surround them—the intensity of the rappers' delivery, the quality of the beats, and how well all those other factors coalesce around the words. And on that score, Daara J's message comes through loud and clear." [...] However, Katharina Lobeck of BBC Music noted that one of the tracks, the R-influenced [...] "Hip Hop Civilization" [...] is [...] "too generically soppy for even the most hardened R fans", but {{went on to say that}} the album is [...] "a successful sonic adventure which thrives on its defiance of the margins of established sales categories".|$|E

500|$|Seemingly {{primitive}} by today's standards, Dragon Warrior features one-on-one combat, {{a limited}} item and equipment array, ten spells, five towns, and five dungeons. [...] While noting its {{importance to the}} development of the RPG genre, Allgame reviewer Kyle Knight states that [...] "taken on its own merits, it's just not an enjoyable game to play." [...] 1UP.com explained why the series was not immensely popular at first in North America; American console gamers were not used to the idea of RPGs, and they said that it would take a decade for the genre to be [...] "flashy enough to distract from all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> they made you read". GameCritics' Chi Kong Lui wrote that the game added realism to video games, and added, [...] "If a player perished in Dragon Warrior, he or she had to suffer the dire consequences of losing progress and precious gold. That element of death evoked a sense of instinctive fear and tension for survival." [...] This, he said, allowed players to identify with the main character on a much larger scale. IGN writer Mark Nix compared the game's seemingly archaic plot to more modern RPGs; he said: [...] "Noble blood means nothing when the society is capitalist, aristocratic, or militaristic. Damsels don't need rescuing – they need a battle axe and some magic tutoring in the field." [...] While reviewing , GameSpy staff wrote that, for many gamers, Dragon Warrior is their first exposure to the console RPG. Recalling their past, a staff member commented: ...|$|E

2500|$|Following are the {{original}} lyrics as composed on February 23, 1940, in Guthrie's {{room at the}} Hanover House hotel at 43rd St. and 6th Ave. (101 West 43rd St.) in New York, showing his strikeouts. The line [...] "This land was made for you and me" [...] does not literally appear in the manuscript {{at the end of}} each verse, but is implied by Guthrie's writing <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> at the top of the page and by his subsequent singing of the line with those words.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> stayed, and some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a student using {{reversibility}} is when learning new vocabulary. The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text. Then, he researches the definition <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> before asking classmate to test him. His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order: he must write the word before defining it, and complete these two steps repeatedly. A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task. The [...] teacher refers {{him back to his}} text in order to notate the next word before he can define it.

[...] However, a child in the concrete operational stage understands the organization, and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given. Using decentration, the child has the two activities on his mind: identify words and find them in the dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Waters {{declared}} that Pink Floyd were [...] "a spent force creatively". Gilmour and Mason {{responded with a}} press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him. Gilmour assumed full control {{of the group and}} produced A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright. Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994's The Division Bell. Gilmour explained: [...] "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words</b> were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. That's what I'm trying to do with A Momentary Lapse of Reason; more focus on the music, restore the balance." [...] In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio. The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo release On an Island, were recorded there.|$|E
2500|$|Psychical or {{religious}} metaphysics. Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over {{the worlds of}} ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits — {{and it is a}} belief in God not as an actual or existent being (in Peirce's sense <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>words),</b> but all the same as a real being. In [...] "" [...] (1908), Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will [...] "stand or fall with the hypothesis"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an [...] "infinitely incomprehensible" [...] being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be more false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.|$|E
