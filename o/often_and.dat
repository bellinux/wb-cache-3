Quite often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite <b>often,</b> <b>and</b> {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less <b>often</b> <b>and</b> far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E

His mother, Dorothy (née Strahern) was warm but changeable of character and had an identical twin who visited them <b>often</b> <b>and</b> who disliked young John. John was unable to tell them apart and was frequently coldly rebuffed by the person he took to be his mother.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too <b>often</b> <b>and</b> they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|The Christian Songs chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} by Billboard magazine. Launched on June21, 2003, the chart is ranked by overall audience impressions (the approximate number of audience impressions made for each play, as determined by BDS data cross-referenced with Arbitron listener information). While all Christian radio formats are covered by the Christian Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits <b>often</b> <b>and</b> for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E
