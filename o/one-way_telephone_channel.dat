40|$|Abstract — The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) {{recommendations}} for dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling are not met by conventional DTMF detectors. We present an efficient DTMF detection algorithm {{based on the}} non-uniform discrete Fourier transform that meets all of the ITU recommendations. The key innovations are the use of two sliding windows and development of sophisticated timing tests. Our algorithm requires no buffering of input samples. To perform DTMF detection on n <b>telephone</b> <b>channels,</b> our algorithm requires approximately n MIPS on a digital signal processor (DSP), 120 + 30 n words of data memory, and 1000 words of program memory.

Three tests have been carried out where naturally-produced and synthesized speech samples have been transmitted over various <b>telephone</b> <b>channels,</b> and then judged by test listeners with respect to their overall quality. The mean auditory ratings obtained in these tests have been compared to estimations provided by the P. 563 model.

40|$|We quantitatively {{investigate}} how the <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> and regional dialect might impact formant frequencies estimates extracted from tools {{commonly used in}} law enforcement. The <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> and regional dialect are important factors in forensic phonetics. In 90 % of forensic cases, the speech sample in question is recorded after transmission via telephone (Byrne and Foulkes, 2004). In addition, qantifiable norms of dialect-dependent features are necessary for forensic examiners to assess if a given acoustic feature is speaker specific or commonly found in the speaker’s dialect (Rose 2002). Past studies have analyzed how the <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> and regional dialects might influence formant frequency estimates, {{but the number of}} speakers are often limited. (At most 20 subjects for channel studies (Byrne and Foulkes 2004; Kunzel 2001), and at most 439 speakers for American English dialects (Labov, Ash, and Boberg 2006).) To the best of our knowledge, our work is the largest scale study on these topics. Formant frequencies estimates in spontaneous conversational speech from more than 3, 600 native American English speakers were extracted using default settings in Wavesurfer (Talkin 1987). We show that estimates of F 1 are higher in cellular channels than those in landline, while F 2 in general shows an opposite trend. We also characterized vowel shift trends in norther...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new speech corpus, STC-TIMIT, and discusses {{the process of}} design, development and its distribution through LDC. The STC-TIMIT corpus {{is derived from the}} widely used TIMIT corpus by sending it through a real and single <b>telephone</b> <b>channel.</b> TIMIT is phonetically balanced, covers the dialectal diversity in continental USA and has been extensively used as a benchmark for speech recognition algorithms, especially in early stages of development. The experimental usability of TIMIT has been increased eventually with the creation of derived corpora, passing the original data through different channels. One such example is the well-known NTIMIT corpus, where the original files in TIMIT are re-recorded after being sent through different telephone calls, resulting in a corpus that characterizes <b>telephone</b> <b>channels</b> in a wide sense. In STC-TIMIT, we followed a similar procedure, but the whole corpus was transmitted in a single telephone call with the goal of obtaining data from a real and yet highly stable <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> across the whole corpus. Files in STC-TIMIT are aligned to those of TIMIT with a theoretical precision of 0. 125 ms, making TIMIT labels valid for the new corpus.

His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts. This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.|$|R

25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 <b>telephone</b> <b>channel,</b> a <b>one-way</b> television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> network. The relay network largely used the same masts as were used for television transmission, which was why the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 frequency converters. The FM network would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 frequency converters.|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to detect {{a change in the}} echo path quickly but not confuse it with double talk, since the echo canceler should react differently for these two phenomena. In this chapter, a sequential detection scheme is presented and, based on model assumptions, the maximum a posteriori probabilities of the occurrence of double talk and abrupt changes in the echo path are derived. By utilizing the fact that the most active part of a typical impulse response of a <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> is short and by using a low complexity time-delay estimation algorithm to find these most active taps and not estimating the rest of the taps, low computational complexity of the proposed detection method is achieved.
