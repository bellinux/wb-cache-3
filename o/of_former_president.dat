5|$|According to the White House and the National First Ladies' Library, {{there have}} been 47 First Ladyships. This {{discrepancy}} exists because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and the 24th president; his spouse Frances Cleveland is also counted twice. Following Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, his spouse, Melania Trump, became the 47th official First Lady, succeeding Michelle Obama, wife <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>President</b> Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|However, on 3 May 2013, Rajoelina made last-minute {{arrangements}} {{to stand in}} the 2013 presidential elections, declaring the roadmap agreement had been breached when former president Ravalomanana's wife, Lalao, decided to stand. The candidacy <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>president</b> Didier Ratsiraka was also permitted; the candidature of all three prominent politicians was rejected by the international community. At the time that Rajoelina submitted his candidacy, he would have run against forty other candidates in total, of whom seven were affiliated with his own political movement.|$|E
5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of the drug war in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four hours away from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>President</b> Felipe Calderón, who made it a top priority to pacify it.|$|E

5|$|On 15 January 2013, Rajoelina officially renounced his {{candidature}} in {{the next}} presidential election, then planned for May 2013. This decision followed a similar declaration on the part <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>president</b> Ravalomanana. Exclusion of both political figures from the next general election was a key precondition to international recognition of the elections, {{as defined by the}} Southern African Development Community in its roadmap toward ending the political crisis. Rajoelina expressed support for Edgar Razafindravahy, interim mayor of Antananarivo and the official candidate of the TGV party among several other party candidates, and declared his intention to run in the 2018 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>President</b> Camille Chamoun.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Former</b> <b>President</b> Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|In December 1994, Mandela {{published}} Long Walk to Freedom, {{an autobiography}} based around a manuscript {{he had written}} in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she {{expressed an interest in}} reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>president</b> Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{moved to}} La Plata in 1969 to study {{law at the}} National University. During this period, {{the decline of the}} Argentine Revolution, the return <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>president</b> Juan Perón from exile, the {{election}} of Héctor Cámpora as president, his resignation and the election of Perón, {{and the beginning of the}} Dirty War had led to severe political turmoil. Kirchner joined the University Federation for the National Revolution (FURN), a political student group whose relationship with the Montoneros guerrillas is a matter of debate. Kirchner was not a leader of the group. He was present at the Ezeiza massacre, in which right-wing Peronist snipers opened fire on a celebration of Juan Perón's return at the Ezeiza International Airport. He was also present at the expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo. Although Kirchner met many members of the Montoneros, he was not a member of the group. By the time the Montoneros were outlawed by Perón, he had left FURN.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death <b>of</b> <b>former</b> <b>President</b> Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized {{that there is no}} Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in {{the hearts and minds of}} people and not through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E
