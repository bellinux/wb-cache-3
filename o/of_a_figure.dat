40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{shows that}} even the symbolic presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attachment <b>figure</b> facilitates the regulation of negative affect triggered by external stressors. Yet, in daily life, pernicious stressors are often internally generated—recalling an upsetting experience reliably increases negative affect, rumination, and susceptibility to physical and psychological health problems. The present research provides the first systematic examination of whether activating the mental representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attachment <b>figure</b> enhances the regulation of affect triggered by thinking about upsetting memories. Using 2 different techniques for priming attachment figure representations and 2 types of negative affect measures (explicit and implicit), activating the mental representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attachment <b>figure</b> (vs. <b>an</b> acquaintance or stranger) after recalling an upsetting memory enhanced recovery—eliminating {{the negative effects of}} the memory recall (Studies 1 – 3). In contrast, activating the mental representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attachment <b>figure</b> before recalling <b>an</b> upsetting memory had no such effect (Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, activating the mental representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attachment <b>figure</b> after thinking about upsetting memories reduced negative thinking in <b>a</b> stream <b>of</b> consciousness task, and the magnitude of the attachment-induced affective recovery effects as assessed with explicit affect measures predicted mental and physical healt...|$|R

500|$|... (He {{has brought}} down the powerful) is an aria for tenor, {{accompanied}} by only the violins (and continuo) united in powerful unison. The instrumental ritornello of 14 measures presents the material. The first motif, later sung on [...] "", begins with a short upbeat and a long note, followed by a straight downward scale and a final leap up, while the continuo presents a broken triad, straight upward one octave. The second motif, later sung on [...] "", begins with an upbeat of three 16th, followed by a rhythmic pattern which expands both the lowest as the highest note, while the continuo moves in steady steps down. For the third motif, sung on [...] "" [...] (from their thrones), the continuo picks up {{the rhythm of the}} second motif, while the violins play a more ornamented downward motion in sixteen continuous 16th. A fourth motif is a sequence of three measures, each a sequence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> of four 16th which is slowly moving upwards. When the singer takes over, the violins accent the end of each motif one to three by a broken downward triad.|$|E
