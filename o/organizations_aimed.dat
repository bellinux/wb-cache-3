5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 1,000underground newspapers; {{among the most}} {{important}} were the Biuletyn Informacyjny of Armia Krajowa and Rzeczpospolita of the Government Delegation for Poland. In addition to publication of news (from intercepted Western radio transmissions), there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics, economics, education, and literature (for example, Sztuka i Naród). The highest recorded publication volume was an issue of Biuletyn Informacyjny printed in 43,000copies; average volume of larger publication was 1,000–5,000copies. The Polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti-Nazi German <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the Germans. Books were also sometimes printed. Other items were also printed, such as patriotic posters or fake German administration posters, ordering the Germans to evacuate Poland or telling Poles to register household cats.|$|E
25|$|The new evangelicals {{would provide}} the strongest {{opposition}} to the liberal trajectory of the Episcopal Church, especially regarding progressive views on homosexuality. In the late 1980s, evangelicals began to form <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at promoting and defending their understanding of Anglican orthodoxy and changing liberal church policies. In 1996, Alden Hathaway, the Bishop of Pittsburgh, founded the American Anglican Council to represent evangelicals at the national level. Unable to alter the liberal program of the Episcopal Church, evangelical Episcopalians and their Anglo-Catholic allies looked to Anglican churches in the Global South for help in a process called Anglican realignment.|$|E

25|$|Gay Student Services v. Texas A University, 737 F.2d 1317 (5th Cir. 1984) is a {{court case}} in which the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the First Amendment {{required}} public universities to recognize student <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at gay students. In 1976, Texas A University denied official recognition to the Gay Student Services Organization on the grounds that homosexuality was illegal in Texas, and the group's stated goalsoffering referral services and providing educational information to studentswere actually the responsibility of university staff. The students sued the university for violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of speech in February 1977. For six years, the case wound its way through the courts; although the trial court ruled in favor of Texas A several times, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals repeatedly overturned the verdict. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting stand the circuit court ruling that the students' free speech rights had been compromised.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immigration}} of Muslims to Europe {{has increased in}} recent decades. Friction has developed between their new neighbours. Conservative Muslim social attitudes on modern issues have caused controversy in Europe and elsewhere. Scholars argue about how much these attitudes {{are a result of}} Islamic beliefs. Some critics consider Islam to be incompatible with secular Western society. Their criticism has been partly influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of New Philosophers. Statements by proponents like Pascal Bruckner describe multiculturalism as an invention of an [...] "enlightened" [...] elite who deny the benefits of democratic rights to non-Westerners by chaining them to their roots. They believe this allows Islam free rein to propagate what they state are abuses, such as the mistreatment of women and homosexuals, and in some countries slavery. They also state that multiculturalism allows a degree of religious freedom that exceeds what is needed for personal religious freedom and is conducive to the creation of <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at undermining European secular or Christian values.|$|E
2500|$|The CWAC {{and other}} {{military}} <b>organizations</b> <b>aimed</b> at attracting young women into the Canadian forces during the Second World War, and {{paved the way for}} women’s future involvement in combat. With tens of thousands of women involved in these organizations, it provided Canadian women with the opportunity to do their part in a global conflict. Although their involvement was critical to the Allied victory, it did not change the power dynamics within Canada regarding military involvement. Sexism returned following the war, forcing women in Canada, and across the world, back into their homes and kitchens. [...] "Women's admittance to the army in World War II had not brought about a change in the distribution of power between the sexes in Canada." [...] The freedom they had experienced during the war was over—it was time to return to their [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "proper" [...] domestic duties. Other scholars argue that the Second World War provided women with the first large-scale opportunity to leave their parents' homes, husbands, and children to engage in paid labour. Never before had this happened at such a high rate for women. [...] This mass exodus of women from Canadian households allowed the women to forge new identities as military service women and munitions workers because of their newfound ability to earn a paycheque doing work in the public sphere. This brief period of freedom provided women across the world with the ability to enter into the public sphere and would eventually drive some {{to become part of the}} women's liberation movement—a key aspect of second-wave feminism.|$|E
