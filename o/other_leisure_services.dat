40|$|Purpose: This paper {{seeks to}} empirically examine the {{relationship}} between corporate image and customer satisfaction in the leisure services sector. It also aims to examine the mediating impact of employees and servicescape on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of 195 individuals who had visited an Australian zoological garden over a specified time period. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the measures, whilst structural equation modelling and multiple regression were used in hypothesis testing. Findings: Findings reveal that corporate image has a significant positive relationship with customer satisfaction. Although the results indicate that the relationship between corporate image and customer satisfaction is not mediated by either servicescape or employees, they imply that corporate image and employees directly influence customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: A single-case study design was implemented, limiting the generalisability of the findings. This provides an opportunity for replication of the model in <b>other</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>services</b> environments and services contexts outside the leisure services industry. Practical implications: The findings reinforce the need for leisure services operators to prioritise the development of a strong, clear corporate image. The extended analysis illustrates that the disaggregated dimensions of corporate image are valuable to consider in terms of directing managerial strategy. Employees and servicescape are key aspects of the service offer on which management needs to focus to ensure that their desired corporate image is communicated and reinforced. Originality/value: This study addresses an identified need to further {{examine the relationship}} between corporate image and customer satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Using {{performance}} data from three Las Vegas hotel-casinos, time series regression models {{were employed to}} better understand the relationship between race and sports book wagering volumes, and slot and table game play. Variables representing both race and sports book wagering volumes failed to produce statistically significant effects in seven of twelve hypothesis tests, within models designed to explain the daily variation in slot and table game play. The results directly extend the work of Abarbanel, Lucas and Singh (2011) by examining the relationship between book wagering levels and table game play, and provide additional empirical tests of the Full Service Theory examined in Lucas (2013 b).

40|$|M. Phil. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} against the theoretical background that local government has the responsibility to provide public <b>leisure</b> <b>services</b> to the communities. Leisure provides an ideal medium for the transmission of historical, social, and cultural values that promote desired norms, customs and social orientations, as such, {{it is vital to}} the community. For disadvantaged communities to experience the benefits of leisure, government has a major role to play in the provision of resources. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe and analyse the provision of local government sport and recreation services in the City of Johannesburg, Soweto area and to present alternative forms of public <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery to aid in ensuring that limited resources are distributed to all. In order to achieve the aim of the study, it was necessary to: 1. Present responsibilities of local government with regard to the provision of sport and recreation in local government. 2. Evaluate whether resources are available for the provision of public <b>leisure</b> <b>services.</b> 3. Analyse the feasibility and implications of the user fee charge policy in public <b>leisure</b> <b>services.</b> 4. Present alternative forms of public <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery to the City of Johannesburg. Theoretical background was dealt with in Chapter two. The chapter started by briefly explaining objectives that direct services in countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and Brazil. Information obtained assisted in explaining that governments can legitimise their policies in very different ways and that service delivery is driven by what the country intends to achieve. Governance structure of sport and recreation in South Africa was discussed. Focus was mainly on local government and its mandatory responsibility towards public <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery. The importance of leisure provisions in fulfilling human needs was illustrated. Literature also indicated that personnel, facilities, money, equipment tend to influence each <b>other</b> to produce <b>leisure</b> <b>services</b> to the community. At the same time, user fee charge policy and marketing of services can impact on service delivery. Through the discussion it was noted that resources are limited. In view of that, it became vital to present alternative forms of public <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery. Literature presented also assisted in constructing an empirical research based on literature provided. The instruments used to collect data were two questionnaires. One questionnaire was for facility managers and the other was for regional managers/ area managers/ operational managers. A pilot {{study was conducted}} to test the reliability and relevancy of the questionnaires which were then adapted accordingly. The main survey comprised forty respondents. Questionnaires were sent to all sixty two sport and recreation facilities owned by The City of Johannesburg in Soweto for facility managers to fill and only forty were returned.

40|$|Abstract: This {{presentation}} explores a {{model of}} service delivery ranging from direct service provision to advocacy and reports findings on the delivery mode most prevalent in park and recreation departments that serve Asian groups in their community. The implications {{of the role of}} the professional, the range of service delivery, and the manner in which ethnic groups are excluded are discussed. The ability of <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> agencies to respond to all constituents in their communities becomes increasingly important as these communities become more ethnically diverse. <b>Leisure</b> <b>service</b> agencies will be challenged to develop more flexible and responsive client-oriented delivery systems if they are to respond to this challenge. To accomplish these changes, <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> professionals must reconceptualize their image of the individual and broaden their notions of <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery. First, I will discuss briefly the conditions which necessitate the reconceptualization of the individual and then will follow with an explanation of an expanded service delivery model. Finally, I will discuss findings gathered from interviews with <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> providers to determine the <b>leisure</b> <b>service</b> delivery roles which they use. By now, most people are familiar with the significant changes in the ethnic composition of this country. According to the 1990 census data, the rate of increase of "minority " populations was almost twice as fast as in the 1970 s. Much of this increase took place among people of Hispanic ancestry—an increase of 7. 7 million people, or a 53 percent increase from 1980. In 1990, the resident population of this country looked as follows: 30 million African Americans, an increase of 13. 2 percent since 1980; 7. 3 million Asians, or an increase of 107. 8 percent in the last 10 years; 2 -million American Indians, up 37. 9 percent; and 22. 4 Hispanics, or an increase of 53 percent since 1980 (Barringe...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{starting}} from the two-sector Uzawa-Lucas model, we study a three-sector endogenous growth model with <b>leisure</b> <b>services.</b> By extending the endogenous growth model with leisure developed by Ladr 3 n-de Guevara et al. [1999], our model generalizes the standard time allocation problem, in that it explicitly accounts for the way total time is allocated between work, education, purely free time and time spent on <b>leisure</b> <b>services,</b> where the latter represents therefore an additional time-consuming activity. Accordingly, service consumption is tied to a production sector for <b>leisure</b> <b>services</b> in our model. We fully characterize Balanced Growth Path (BGP) equilibria {{in terms of time}} allocation and growth, and show that multiple BGPs are possible. Since service production {{plays an important role in}} economic development, we carry out a comparative analysis of the dynamic performance of different economic systems - Post-Industrial Economy vs. Service Economy - along a BGP...|$|R
