5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{draws upon}} many poems, {{including}} ideas from William Cowper's Task. There {{is also a}} possible connection to John Thelwall's poem To the Infant Hampden.—Written during a Sleepless Night. Derby. Oct. 1797 along with his other poems On Leaving the Bottoms of Glocestershire and Maria: A Fragment. Other sources are William Collins Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland. In terms of philosophy, Coleridge brings together ideas in George Berkeley's An Essay Towards a New Theory <b>of</b> <b>Vision</b> <b>and</b> David Hartley's Observations on Man.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is based}} on a William Overgard-drawn comics panel from a Steve Roper cartoon. Lichtenstein's {{derivation}} augments the presentation of the narrative and expands the use of color in the image. As with the original the image employs the theme <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> focuses specifically on mechanized vision as well as monocularity.|$|E
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades {{has been reduced to}} a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted {{on the sides of the}} head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E

5|$|The Pensacola Dam, {{also known}} as the Grand River Dam, is a multiple-arch {{buttress}} dam on the Grand River in-between Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first hydroelectric power plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch dam in the world.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

25|$|Behavioural {{studies show}} that many avian species focus on distant objects {{preferentially}} with their lateral and monocular ﬁeld <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> birds will orientate themselves sideways to maximise visual resolution.

People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the stimulus.|$|E

25|$|Cat food is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards. Long-term taurine deficiency {{may result in}} retinal degeneration, loss <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac arrest.|$|E
