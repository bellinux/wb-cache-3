5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition {{is controlled by the}} compartment that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range <b>of</b> <b>possibilities</b> for the organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E
40|$|In this review, I {{classified}} the semantic/structural types <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> expressions {{that possible}} verbs {{are used as}} predicates, based on "the point of realizability". And then, I identified the syntactical features that supported the types, and reviewed what each type expresses the meaning <b>of</b> <b>possibility.</b> I discovered that the meaning <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> expression sentences cannot be clearly divided into and, but that there are types that show {{the transition from the}} former to the latter. In addition, I analyzed under what structural features the meaning <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> expressions tend to appear, and how the transition between two types takes place. Moreover, we cannot deny the linkage between the meaning <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> expressions and the form of tense that the predicate shows, but, I concluded that the meaning <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> expressions is directed by the relation between the situation and timeliness that a sentence expresses...|$|R

5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number <b>of</b> <b>possibilities</b> was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a first {{systematic}} study of the expression <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> in Kirundi, more specifically of its verbal markers. Possibility is traditionally seen {{as one of the}} core components of the semantic domain of modality. The onomasiological approach of this modal sub‑domain has resulted in the identification of four verbal potential markers, i. e., the auxiliaries ‑bâsh‑ and ‑shóbor‑, the semi‑auxiliary ‑shóbok‑, and the TAM affix ‑oo‑. These four markers <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> manifest different degrees of grammaticalization along the full verb > auxiliary > affix cline. Grammaticalization in the structural domain seems to be correlated with semantic change, both within and beyond the semantic domain <b>of</b> <b>possibility.</b> The related verbs ‑shóbor‑ and ‑shóbok‑, which have no or little remaining lexical uses, cover the entire semantic domain <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> in contrast to ‑bâsh‑ which has still clearly distinct lexical uses (‘to be active, to be healthy’) and only conveys participant‑inherent possibility. The inflectional affix ‑oo‑, covering the entire domain <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> and having developed other modal and non‑modal meanings, manifests the most advanced semantic generalization. Moreover, ‑oo‑ underwent the strongest subjectification within the semantic domain <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> and even developed different intersubjective uses. Hence, the most grammaticalized marker <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> in Kirundi not only underwent the strongest semantic generalization, but its meaning is also the most (inter) subjectified...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of a distinctively {{chemical}} notion <b>of</b> <b>possibility.</b> This is the notion <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> that occurs in chemical discourses when chemists speak <b>of</b> the <b>possibility</b> or impossibility <b>of</b> achieving a given result through chemical means. This notion pertains to the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> processes, not of compounds, so it differs from the kind <b>of</b> chemical <b>possibility</b> mentioned in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations or the kinds discussed {{in the literature on}} Putnam's Twin Earth argument. I argue that this process-oriented notion <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> cannot be reduced in a simple way to physical possibility, and that standard possible worlds semantics does not allow a natural analysis of this notion. I suggest an extension of possible worlds semantics that may overcome this limitation. I finish by pointing out some open questions about chemical possibility. Versio...|$|R

25|$|In general, {{the range}} <b>of</b> <b>possibilities</b> is first narrowed down (often by {{entering}} the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains {{more than one}} possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although this may seem painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing English.|$|E

25|$|On {{the way to}} his {{classification}} of Riemannian holonomy groups, Berger developed two criteria that must be satisfied by the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of a torsion-free affine connection which is not locally symmetric: one of them, known as Berger's first criterion, is a consequence of the Ambrose–Singer theorem, that the curvature generates the holonomy algebra; the other, known as Berger's second criterion, comes from the requirement that the connection should not be locally symmetric. Berger presented a list of groups acting irreducibly and satisfying these two criteria; this can be interpreted as a list <b>of</b> <b>possibilities</b> for irreducible affine holonomies.|$|E
