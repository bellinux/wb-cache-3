25|$|Kansas {{politics}} have been roiled in recent years. The {{rise of the}} Tea Party and the election <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> have prompted Republicans to embrace a purer brand of conservatism and purge what had long been a robust moderate wing from its ranks. Mr. Roberts has sought to adapt to this new era, voting against spending bills that included projects for the state that he had sought.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced {{support for}} the {{establishment}} of a Palestinian state—a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation. Upon the arrival <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with the Palestinians would be conditioned on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state.|$|E

25|$|At the {{direction}} <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama,</b> the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency played {{an active role}} since {{the early stages of}} the Syrian Civil War. The U.S. originally supplied the moderate rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid but soon escalated to providing training, money, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders. On 17 September 2014, the House of Representatives voted to authorize spending to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels.|$|E
25|$|After {{a sudden}} {{revolution}} in Tunisia in 2011, protests occurred {{in almost every}} Arab state. The wave of demonstrations {{became known as the}} Arab Spring, and the handling of the Arab Spring {{played a major role in}} Obama's foreign policy. After three weeks of unrest, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned at the urging <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama.</b> General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi eventually took power from Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi in a 2013 coup d'état, prompting the US to cut off arms shipments to its long-time ally. However, Obama resumed the shipments in 2015. Yemen experienced a revolution and then civil war, leading to a Saudi military campaign that received logistical and intelligence assistance from the United States. The period following the Arab Spring is sometimes called the Arab Winter, as many states experienced violence and government crackdowns.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} {{election}} <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama,</b> Associate Justice David H. Souter had {{expressed a desire to}} leave Washington, D.C., and return to his native New Hampshire. The election of a Democratic president in 2008 made Souter more inclined to retire, but {{he did not want to}} create a situation in which there would be multiple vacancies at once. Souter apparently became satisfied that no other justices planned to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's term in June 2009. As a result, in mid-April 2009 he privately notified the White House of his intent to retire from the Supreme Court at the conclusion of its business for that term. Souter submitted a resignation letter to Obama on May 1, who later that day made an unscheduled appearance during the daily White House press briefing to publicly announce Souter's retirement.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston {{exhibited}} …Out of Here: The Veterans Project. The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the bustle of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E

500|$|Amid {{the massive}} crowds that {{arrived at the}} U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to {{reserved}} areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates {{at the start of}} the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in underground tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the National Mall. People dubbed one such tunnel [...] "the Purple Tunnel of Doom", after the purple tickets that would-be viewers held. Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein, in her capacity as chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, launched an investigation to address complaints by the affected ticket holders. The committee later announced that ticket holders who were unable to enter the Capitol grounds to view the ceremony would receive a copy of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> and Vice President Biden and a color print of the inaugural ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Celebrations {{surrounding}} the inauguration, {{praise of the}} event's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse. In Kenya, the home country of Obama's father, people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday. Indonesians and Americans in Jakarta watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from State Elementary School Menteng 01, the school that Obama attended as a child. The city of Obama in Japan celebrated the event with fireworks, bell-ringing and hula-dancing at the Hagaji Temple. Governor General Michaëlle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians, while Mexican President Felipe Calderón wished Obama [...] "great success in the work as the new President of the United States". Israeli President Shimon Peres described Obama's inauguration as a [...] "great day" [...] for the United States, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted that [...] "The whole world is watching the inauguration <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama,</b> witnessing {{a new chapter in}} both American history and the world's history." ...|$|E
