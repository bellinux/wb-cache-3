5|$|James Murrell (c. 1785 – 16 December 1860), {{also known}} as Cunning Murrell, was an English cunning man, or {{professional}} folk magician, who {{spent most of his}} life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex. In this capacity, he reportedly employed magical means to aid in healing both humans and animals, exorcising malevolent spirits, countering witches, and restoring lost <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> property to its owner.|$|E
5|$|By 1829, Randolph {{had three}} {{commission}} warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern. In 1834, Randolph had {{a population of}} approximately 1,000. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, private schools, and more than ten saloons. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the Randolph Recorder and the Randolph Whig. In the 1830s, the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week. The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed {{in part to the}} use of slave labor, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> slaves.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association was {{established}} to promote the Manipuri pony breed and the game of polo. In recent years, breed numbers have decreased, and estimates place the breed at somewhere between 2,300 and 1,000 in population in the 21st century. Population numbers continue to dwindle {{in part due to}} high numbers of ponies being smuggled into Myanmar (Burma), where the breed is in demand, after either having been purchased <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> from their Indian owners. In 2005, a heritage park was begun by the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association with the goal of preventing the extinction of the breed and promoting them to tourists.|$|E
5|$|Murrell {{claimed that}} he could exorcise malevolent spirits, destroy witches, and restore lost <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> {{property}} to its owner, {{as well as providing}} services as an astrologer, herbalist, and animal healer. He charged a halfpenny for curing warts, and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch's spell. He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing his hands over their affected area, muttering a prayer, and then hanging an amulet about their neck, and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex, Suffolk, and northern Kent. During his lifetime, Murrell was known {{on both sides of the}} Thames Estuary, although not apparently beyond that. He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places, including from Essex girls who were working as maids in London.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Władysław {{successfully}} defended Poland {{against foreign}} invasions. He {{was recognized as}} a good tactician and strategist, who did much to modernize the Polish Army. Władysław ensured that the officer corps was significantly large so that the army could be expanded; introduced foreign (Western) infantry to the Polish Army, with its pikes and early firearms, and supported {{the expansion of the}} artillery. His attempt to create a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy resulted {{in the creation of a}} new port village, Władysławowo. Despite promising beginnings, Władysław failed to secure enough funds for the fleet creation; the ships were gone – sunk, <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> – by the 1640s.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, horses moved {{continually}} between Spain and Portugal, {{and horses}} from the studs of Andalusia {{were used to}} improve the Portuguese cavalry. Portugal's successful restoration war against Spain (1640–1668) was in part based on mounted troops riding war horses of Spanish blood. During the reign of Philip III of Portugal (also Philip IV of Spain), Portuguese horse breeding reached its lowest point. The Spanish passed laws to halt the country's production of cavalry horses, and what stud farms did exist were run in secrecy with horses smuggled <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> from Spain. These secret farms, however, provided the base for the modern Lusitano. In 1662, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal, the royal dowry included Portugal's Tangier and Bombay garrisons. These garrisons included large groups of Portuguese cavalry, mounted on Iberian horses.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E

The refund of a lost <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> Oyster card {{is based on the}} original pro-rata daily rate.

25|$|There {{are those}} that insist that because the governments of China and Taiwan {{abandoned}} their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. Such critics {{also point out that}} even though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers. Others dispute that Japanese colonial assets in large proportion were built <b>or</b> <b>stolen</b> with extortion or force in occupied countries, as was clearly the case with artworks collected (<b>or</b> <b>stolen)</b> by Nazis during World War II throughout Europe.|$|E
