In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E

5|$|Thallium is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
5|$|Jadranski naftovod (JANAF) {{operates}} an oil terminal at Omišalj, Krk Island. In 2010, the JANAF transported 6.4million tonnes of <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> 7% {{drop from}} 6.9million tonnes in 2009. In 2010, JANAF recorded annual revenue of 464.9million kuna (62.8million euro), down less than 1% from 2009, and annual net profit of 118.5million kuna (16million euro), up 11% {{from the previous}} year. However, JANAF operations include other facilities and services besides the oil terminal concession in the Port of Rijeka. JANAF is a joint stock company owned by the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute (50.5%), INA (16%), the Republic of Croatia (14.5%) and other shareholders owning less than 10% of stock each. JANAF's {{chairman of the board}} is Ante Markov. As of March 31, 2011, JANAF had 383 employees working in the Omišalj terminal and other JANAF facilities in Croatia.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

50|$|Oil cooling is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> system used solely for lubrication, oil cooling requires additional <b>oil</b> capacity, <b>a</b> greater flow rate through the <b>oil</b> pump, and <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> cooler (or <b>a</b> larger cooler than normal).|$|R
