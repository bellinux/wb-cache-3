40|$|Household {{consumption}} expenditure represents a crucial measure {{to be used}} for assessing individuals’ material living conditions and well-being. Indeed, the analysis of household conditions can provide policy makers with a clear picture of the economic and social situation of the area in which they are operating. However, <b>official</b> <b>sample</b> surveys which are generally used for this purpose, such as the Household Budget Survey in Italy carried out by the National Institute of Statistics, do not allow for reliable disaggregated estimates thus hindering appropriate and effective planning and evaluation of political interventions at local level. By referring to the 2012 Italian Household Budget Survey, this paper aims at obtaining reliable provincial estimates of household consumption expendi- ture in Italy.

In fact this amounts to a 3 % sample of the 1991 census being released in anonymous form, without any names and addresses and only coded to large geographical areas. This followed almost a decade of discussion and debate about the content, need and confidentiality aspects of possible microdata from the census.

40|$|The <b>official</b> <b>sample</b> {{surveys are}} not {{generally}} representative for foreigners, which increased {{the demand for}} reliable administrative records as sources of statistical information on migrants, especially if {{the focus is on}} demographic behaviors. To overcome the limits of existing data and to give proper importance to the information from administrative sources we have implemented a record linkage between of different datasets and of different years. Our main interest is to link the fertility behaviors of women with their migration history. Hence, we will focus on the Survey on Live Births of the Italian resident population and on information from the residence permits of the Italian Ministry of the Interior. The main novelty of this work is the use of stock and flow data from administrative registers to construct a longitudinal dataset that includes information on births and migrations in a determinate interval of years. This information was missing until now in the Italian context. The possibility of recovering information allows us to analyze the risk of having one or more children in the period considering also the migration history...|$|E
40|$|The {{minimum wage}} was first {{established}} in the former Czech and Slovak Federative Republic in 1991, currently the issue of minimum wage in the Czech Republic is stipulated by act number 262 / 2006 Coll., Labour Act. The aim of the submitted article is to identify {{the position of the}} minimum wage in the wage distribution of the entrepreneurial sector in the Czech Republic, the outline of the further development in wages with respect to average and median wages and the wages of the 1 st and 9 th deciles, as well as the outline of the development of the statutory minimum wage. <b>Official</b> <b>sample</b> survey data from the Information system on average salaries from the years 2001 - 2008 is used (quarterly-period frequency). This data is processed using the method of descriptive statistics. Conclusion can be reached based on an analysis of this statistical data that during the period of time in question all monitored wage categories saw wage rises. However the rise was not uniformly fast or balanced. The wages raised the most in case of the best-paid employees (9 th decile wage) and in case of the minimum wage, whereas the 1 st decile wage rose the least. The minimum wage amount was not adjusted since 1 st July 2006, so the growth in question had been recorded only between the years 2001 and 2006. The development of the calculated indices of the decile ratio can lead us to the conclusion that certain increase in wage differentiation took place, even though this process was not uniform again...|$|E

For laying hens, 2. 2 % of the flocks tested salmonella positive, i. e. 0. 4 % less than in the year 2010.

Scott Smith of Opflex, an oil clean-up company, states that <b>official</b> <b>samples</b> are of surface water only: “Exxon and the EPA are taking instantaneous water samples, grab samples from the surface. Obviously if the contaminants in oil sands oil, and chemicals, are in the water column beneath the surface you’re {{not going to get any}} of those molecules to test.” Keith Stephens of Arkansas Game and Fish has countered these findings, pointing out that there have been no dead fish or other wildlife that would indicate that there is oil in the main body of the lake.|$|R

Currently, an <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> plan for fresh fish defining sample size, inspection methods, and criteria to accept or reject the merchandise is lacking at the European and Italian level. In this study, we compared the visual inspection proposed by the sampling plan of the Lombardy Region (Italy) to the UV press method and to an optimized digestion procedure with the aim to assess its ability in detecting visible parasites.

30|$|Optimized {{cooperation}} between ECHA and suppliers {{as well as}} education campaigns for industry and trade actors could support them on how {{to carry out their}} legal duties. Information flow in the supply chain can be simplified by a standardized format for communication on SVHCs in articles [9, 43]. If information requests are facilitated in all EU countries, e.g., by easy-to-use smartphone applications like ToxFox or Scan 4 Chem, the number of information requests by consumers could be increased, leading to an increased awareness of consumers as well as of suppliers. An <b>official</b> <b>sample</b> letter, such as the one proposed in Box 1, could facilitate the answers to the consumer requests for suppliers and could render the answers better understandable for consumers. However, an exclusive focus on SVHCs might distract consumers from other dangerous substances in everyday products. For example, if SVHCs are absent in the packaging of personal care products, this might lead to a false sense of safety as the personal care product itself in the container may contain heavy metals, potential sensitizers, or endocrine disruptors. The information duty should therefore be extended to mixtures (like personal care products) and it should not only include SVHCs, but also address substances that were identified to be of risk in other regulations (see also [47]). A full declaration of ingredients in articles could better cope with a growing candidate list and increasing information about other hazardous substances. The SVHC information does not give the consumer any information either about the chemical exposure by the respective article or about the aggregated exposure from various sources. This aspect should also receive more consideration in future. Improvements are needed in the suppliers’ responses to support safe handling of articles by consumers. In addition, clear criteria are needed for substituting substances which ascertain that the new ingredients are proven to be less dangerous than the substituted substance according to the present assessment criteria. The SINimilarity tool is a first help to avoid substitution by substances of similar hazard [42].|$|E

40|$|Abstract] The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to compare various methods to determine flunixin in test samples collected periodically from horses after intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) dosing at the maximum recommended dosage and to document detection times for this drug in test samples. Flunixin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in horses, was administered to eight mares in five consecutive daily doses of 1. 1 mg per kilogram of body weight by the IM or IV route. Flunixin was detected in urine samples collected at various times after drug administration by flunixin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) methods. Detection me was defined as the time period over which flunixin was detected and was dependent on the method used. The shortest detection times were 24 to 48 h and were observed when the TIC method was used. On the other hand, detection times were as long as 15 days when HPLC, GC-MS, and flunixin ELISA methods were used. The use of these more sensitive tests to monitor <b>official</b> <b>samples</b> collected from racehorses could result in positive tests for flunixin when it is exerting no detectable clinical effects because it produces clinical effects lasting only 24 - 36 h in horses...|$|R
