25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened sense of taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Rise Up (Colors of Peace) was {{a musical}} project to turn Gülen's poems and {{writings}} in Turkish language into songs. A selection {{had already been}} published as English language translations under the title Broken Plectrum. A total of 50 poems were sent to various Muslim and non-Muslim artists from various countries, who were free to pick, and then compose and vocalize the poem chosen, record it {{in their own country}} and send it back for inclusion in the planned album. Reportedly, no restrictions were put on the artists in using instrumentation, despite reservations by stricter Muslim interpretations about music and use of musical instruments. The album Rise Up (Colors of Peace) turned into an album of world music encompassing various genres like jazz, pop, flamenco, rai, Indian music among others. The artists appearing (in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> on the track list) were: The Good Morning Diary, Maher Zain, Faudel, Cristelo Duo featuring Bruno Gouveia, Ryan Shaw, Natacha Atlas, Bon Bon, KK & Reet, Mazachigno featuring Ely Bruna, Bahroma, Carmen Paris, Kobi Farhi & Ruba Shamshoum. The project took more than two years to realize and the album was released in 2013 by Nil Production and Universal Music.|$|E
25|$|There was {{negative}} player feedback after release concerning {{the handling of}} playable characters, in particular that Alisha was not playable {{through most of the}} game despite her prominent presence in early promotional material. It was further inflamed by the announcement of Alisha After Episode, with many players saying that Alisha's absence from {{the second half of the}} main game was an excuse to monetize the character. During an appearance at the Taipei Game Show, Baba said that the appearance of characters in promotional material reflected their <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> in the game rather than their importance or prominence in the game. He also stated that the story did not have a specific heroine, leaving players the freedom to choose one for themselves. Later, Baba elaborated to Famitsu that the material sent to publications did not specifically refer to Alisha as the game's heroine, although the development team for mobile spin-off Tales of Asteria included information describing Alisha as Zestirias heroine, much to Baba's regret. He further stated that Alisha's story role is important despite her early departure, and that the ability for Rose to wear Alisha's DLC costumes was kept quiet to avoid spoiling the story. Bandai Namco kept this situation in mind while considering whether to release Alisha After Episode with the main game or as a standalone product in the west.|$|E

500|$|Epsilon Eridani was {{included}} in several star catalogues of medieval Islamic astronomical treatises, which were based on Ptolemy's catalogue: in Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars, published in 964, Al-Biruni's Mas'ud Canon, published in 1030, and Ulugh Beg's Zij-i Sultani, published in 1437. Al-Sufi's estimate of Epsilon Eridani's magnitude was 3. Al-Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al-Sufi (for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy's and Al-Sufi's magnitudes; original values of both these magnitudes are 3). Its number in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> is 786. Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani's coordinates in his observatory at Samarkand, and quotes magnitudes from Al-Sufi (3 for Epsilon Eridani). The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg's catalogue are [...] "U 781" [...] and [...] "Eri 13" [...] (the latter {{is the same as}} Ptolemy's catalogue designation).|$|E
500|$|Epsilon Eridani {{has been}} known to {{astronomer}}s since at least the 2nd century AD, when Claudius Ptolemy (a Greek astronomer from Alexandria, Egypt) included it in his catalogue of more than a thousand stars. The catalogue was published as part of his astronomical treatise the Almagest. The constellation Eridanus was named by Ptolemy ( [...] , [...] ), and Epsilon Eridani was listed as its thirteenth star. Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani , [...] (here [...] is the number four). This refers to a group of four stars in Eridanus: γ, π, δ and ε (10th–13th in Ptolemy's list). ε is the most western of these, and thus the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west. Modern scholars of Ptolemy's catalogue designate its entry as [...] "P 784" [...] (in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance)</b> and [...] "Eri 13". Ptolemy described the star's magnitude as 3.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, {{in order}} to combat boredom and {{absenteeism}} in his introductory zoology course, Eakin gave his first lecture in character, appearing unannounced in full costume and makeup as William Harvey, the 17th-century physician who made the first complete descriptions of blood circulation. His portrayals of historic scientists, including Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, and Gregor Mendel, often involved elaborate wigs, makeup, costumes, and props, aided by professional makeup artists and drama teachers- his portrayal of Darwin required up to three hours of makeup, wig, and beard preparation. His lectures were popular with students from the start and attracted international attention, with profiles in publications such [...] as LIFE, Der Spiegel, and the International Herald Tribune. He gave guest lectures at universities nationwide, and in 1975 compiled the text of his lectures, along with photographs, diagrams, and stage directions, into a book, Great Scientists Speak Again. Eakin typically gave six lectures in character during a course, with each [...] "guest lecturer" [...] introducing particular concepts. The figures portrayed, in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> during a typical course, were: ...|$|E
