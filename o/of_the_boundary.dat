5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary,</b> and using them to directly simulate the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary,</b> rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used}} to simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration.

The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, a later set of {{meetings}} at Champoeg created the Provisional Government of Oregon with a judiciary {{consisting of a}} Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace for trial level courts. Albert E. Wilson was the first judge chosen as the Supreme Judge under this new government, but never served. Other judges were appointed or elected during this pre-territory period {{over the next six}} years. Until 1846 with the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute, the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power. With the resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> issue, Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude, with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control California.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the United States and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boundary</b> Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E

5|$|Lismore {{was part}} of the kingdom of Dalriada in the 6th century and {{probably}} thereafter until the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century, after which it is likely the island was absorbed into the Norse-Gael Kingdom of the Isles. Magnus Barelegs had established direct Norwegian overlordship over this sprawling sea kingdom by 1098. In that year, Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus which settled much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Scots and Norwegian claims in these islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides but there were a few exceptions including Luing and Lismore, which were retained by the Scots.|$|E
5|$|M. rugustus, M. yaotunensis, and M. lashuyuanensis are {{all known}} from the Nanxiong Basin in Guangdong. This {{formation}} was deposited primary from streams, rivers, and lakes in that region. It spans across the K/T boundary, at which point most of the dinosaur eggs disappear, but Macroolithus apparently exists on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> (which would imply that some species of dinosaurs survived into the early Tertiary). However, sedimentological evidence suggests that these fossils were actually reworked by debris flows into the Tertiary rocks.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{remaining}} areas {{of what is now}} the state were purchased in 1803 from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase (the area west of the Mississippi having been recently acquired by France from Spain). Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in Rupert's Land, a large territory owned by Hudson's Bay Company. The exact definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{property}} {{on the road}} becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century.

In July 1866, following the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E

The highway then enters Washoe County, where the highway enters Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. It then turns northwest, running through Incline Village.

Just short of the California state line, it turns south to run parallel to the line and finally crosses into California at Crystal Bay.

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield. The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin. In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829, a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} settle the matter, the federal {{authorities}} set up a five-member commission presided over by Milovan Đilas in June 1945. The commission identified three sets of disputed territories. Those were the districts of Subotica, Sombor, Apatin and Odžaci in Bačka, districts of Batina and Darda in Baranja, and districts of Vukovar, Šid and Ilok in Syrmia. The districts in Bačka were awarded to Vojvodina, while those in Baranja were awarded to Croatia, both primarily along ethnic lines. The commission also noted that if Yugoslavia managed to acquire the region of Baja from Hungary, the decision regarding Bačka would be reviewed. The district of Vukovar was also awarded to Croatia, while Ilok and Šid were assigned to Vojvodina. In case of Ilok, the decision was specified to be provisional until authorities are consolidated on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary,</b> when the issue would be reexamined.|$|E
