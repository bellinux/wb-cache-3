40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the joint behaviour <b>of</b> <b>precedences</b> <b>of</b> one sample {{with respect to}} a threshold from the other sample and exceedances of second sample {{with respect to a}} threshold from the Їrst sample. Exact distributions under the same distribution of the samples and under stochastically ordered distributions are obtained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{results on}} the algebraic ordering properties <b>of</b> operator <b>precedence</b> grammars and languages. This work was motivated by, and applied to, the mechanical acquisition or inference <b>of</b> operator <b>precedence</b> grammars. A new normal form <b>of</b> operator <b>precedence</b> grammars called homogeneous is defined. An algorithm is given to construct a grammar, called max-grammar, generating the largest language which is compatible with a given precedence matrix. Then the class of free grammars is introduced as a special subclass <b>of</b> operator <b>precedence</b> grammars. It is shown that operator precedence languages corresponding to a given precedence matrix form a Boolean algebra...|$|R

5|$|The medal {{is ranked}} {{fourth in the}} order <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> of wearing of medals and decorations. The medals are {{produced}} at Alipore Mint, Kolkata {{along with the other}} civilian and military awards like Bharat Ratna, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Veer Chakra.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Army Cadets, they form the Canadian Cadet Organizations. Though the cadet {{programs}} {{have a close}} relationship with the CF, cadets are not members of the Forces, and are not expected or required to join the Canadian Forces. In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets stand last in the order <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> after the Royal Canadian Sea and Army Cadets.|$|E

50|$|The Sovereign may, as fount of honour, {{vary the}} <b>precedence</b> <b>of</b> the peers or {{of any other}} people. For example, Elizabeth II granted her husband, Prince Philip, Duke <b>of</b> Edinburgh, <b>precedence</b> {{immediately}} following her; otherwise, he would have ranked {{along with the other}} dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|In 1863, it {{provided}} an escort to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) through the Savernake Forest, {{in recognition of}} which {{it was the first}} regiment in the British Army to be awarded the title of 'Prince of Wales's Own' (entitling it to wear the Prince of Wales's feathers as a badge). In 1884, it was placed {{at the head of the}} newly formed Yeomanry Order <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> by Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Joint Secretaries in the Union Government is {{analogous}} to Major-General and equivalent ranks in Indian Armed Forces and are listed as such in the Order <b>of</b> <b>Precedence.</b> In the Cabinet Secretariat, the Military wing is headed by an officer {{from one of the}} three services with the rank of Major General and equivalent is given the status of this rank and is designated as Joint Secretary (Military) in the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's {{tenure of}} 11 years and 209 days as Prime Minister {{was the longest}} since Lord Salisbury (13 years and 252 days, in three spells) and the longest {{continuous}} period in office since Lord Liverpool (14 years and 305 days). She remains the longest-serving Prime Minister officially referred to as such, as the post was only officially given recognition in the order <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> in 1905.|$|E

5|$|The {{highest ranking}} civil servant is the Cabinet Secretary. He is ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board; {{the chief of}} the Indian Administrative Service and head of all civil {{services}} under the rules of business of the Government of India. He also holds the 11th position in the Order <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
50|$|Many {{programming}} language manuals provide a table <b>of</b> operator <b>precedence</b> and associativity; see, for example, {{the table for}} C and C++.|$|R

5|$|In {{cases of}} {{conflict}} between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and Søren Kierkegaard), there is no order <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of their close association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a choice between one or the other.|$|E
5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.|$|E
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to be a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{constraint}} based computational model <b>of</b> linear <b>precedence</b> as {{employed in the}} HPSG grammar formalism. An extended feature logic which adds a wide range <b>of</b> constraints involving <b>precedence</b> is described. A sound, complete and terminating deterministic constraint solving procedure is given. Deterministic computational model is achieved by weakening the logic such that it is sufficient for linguistic applications involving word-order...|$|R

5|$|Reception for {{the medal}} was mixed, with {{veterans}} criticizing {{the placement of}} the medal in the order <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> Production of the medal was halted on 12 March 2013, pending a review of its precedence as ordered by Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel. It was subsequently cancelled by Secretary Hagel on 15 April 2013 who made the decision to instead create and offer a new distinguishing device to existing medals. On January 8, 2016, the DoD presented two new award devices.|$|E
5|$|The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic {{effectively}} replaced {{as national}} orders the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), which the sovereign, as fons honorum, did not abdicate. Today these continue merely as dynastic {{orders of the}} Royal House in Exile. While their bestowal is suppressed by law in Italy, the use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is recognised, exclusive of any right <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> in official ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (19 March 2017–present), is {{the head}} of state and {{invested}} primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting {{of the members of the}} Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the German order <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the Bundestag.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the use <b>of</b> value <b>precedence</b> constraints to break value symmetry. We first give a simple encoding <b>of</b> value <b>precedence</b> into ternary constraints that is both efficient and effective at breaking symmetry. We then extend value precedence {{to deal with a}} number of generalizations like wreath value and partial interchangeability. We also show that value precedence is closely related to lexicographical ordering. Finally, we consider the interaction between value precedence and symmetry breaking constraints for variable symmetries. ...|$|R
5000|$|There is some {{ambiguity}} on {{the requirements}} needed {{to hold the}} post due to its workings being based mostly on custom and convention. The term of [...] "Leader of the Opposition" [...] is only legally recognized in a Royal Decree passed in 1983 establishing the order of preference of public authorities in general official acts organized by the Crown, Government or the State Administration, acknowledging the figure of Opposition Leader but only {{to put it in}} fifteenth place in the list <b>of</b> <b>precedences.</b>|$|R
50|$|According {{to several}} ancient sources, {{including}} occasions by the Dictionnaire de pédagogie et d'instruction primaire by Ferdinand Buisson in 1887, the first French settlement in Senegal {{dates back to}} the Dieppe Mariners in the 14th century. Flattering for Norman sailors, this argument gives credence also to the idea <b>of</b> a <b>precedence</b> <b>of</b> the French presence in the region, but it is not confirmed by subsequent work.|$|R
