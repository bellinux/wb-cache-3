He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London.

5|$|When the Secretary of State for Defence {{announced}} the {{contract for the}} vessels, the cost was initially estimated at £3.9billion. The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4,085m for two ships. The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years. This decision alone added £1,560m to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5,900m; taking off the cost of capital led to a MPR10 Capital DEL baseline cost of £5,254m at this time. If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £1.5bn <b>of</b> <b>planned</b> spending on Queen Elizabeth and £1.3bn <b>of</b> <b>planned</b> spending on Prince of Wales, but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £989m and £2,098m respectively. These long term savings were {{less important than the}} short term costs, there would have been nearly an extra £1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs in the FY11/12 budget. In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6,200m and BAE agreeing to pay 50% of any cost overruns rather than 10% as previously.|$|E

5|$|The JNA {{planned a}} {{two-stage}} mobilisation of troops. The {{first wave of}} call-ups was performed in July, and was meant to intimidate Croatia without an actual offensive being launched and allow timely deployment of crucial units. After {{the first stage of}} the mobilisation failed to deter Croatian forces, the second stage commenced on 15 September; it was met with a large-scale refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units and to abandon some operations. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26% of those called-up reported for service. Nonetheless, in September 1991, the JNA discharged conscripts that had completed their terms of service, and reached 73% <b>of</b> <b>planned</b> troop levels. The mobilisation problems demoralised JNA troops and commanders. A request made by JNA general command to Milošević for general mobilisation to strengthen troop levels was denied because he did not believe the campaign was needed nor feasible. Despite the mobilisation problems, the JNA and the TO forces deployed in support of the campaign consisted of approximately 145,000 troops, 1,100 tanks, 700 other armoured vehicles and 1,980 artillery pieces, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Peshwa's territories were {{absorbed into}} the Bombay Presidency and the {{territory}} seized from the Pindaris became the Central Provinces of British India. The princes of Rajputana became symbolic feudal lords who accepted the British as the paramount power. Thus Francis Rawdon-Hastings redrew the map of India to a state which remained more or less unaltered until the time of Lord Dalhousie. The British brought an obscure descendant of Shivaji, {{the founder of the}} Maratha Empire, to be the ceremonial head of the Maratha Confederacy to replace the seat of the Peshwa. An infant from the Holkar family was appointed as the ruler of Nagpur under British guardianship. The Peshwa adopted a son, Nana Sahib, who went on {{to be one of the}} leaders of the Rebellion of 1857. After 1818, Montstuart Elphinstone reorganized the administrative divisions for revenue collection, thus reducing the importance of the Patil, the Deshmukh, and the Deshpande.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} conceptual {{tools for}} the analysis <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. These are, firstly, a model <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems as learning systems, and then three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour, each described by defining a pair of dichotomous concepts at their far ends: 'blueprint' versus 'process' modes of planning; 'rational-deductive' decision-making versus 'disjointed incrementalism'; 'normative' versus 'functional' <b>planning.</b> Each <b>of</b> these concepts is discussed in detail, and some indicators {{for the analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour are suggested. Finally, a more complex model is constructed which combines the three dimensions. Elements of this model are firstly {{the level at which}} planning is conducted within a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems, and secondly, the 'planning sub-structure', that is the technology-image reflecting the nature <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> problems and available planning technologies.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by cast member William Shatner, following two films being directed by his co-star Leonard Nimoy. Shatner also developed the initial storyline, in which Sybok searches for God, but instead finds an alien being. Series creator Gene Roddenberry disliked the original script, while Nimoy and DeForest Kelley objected to the premise that their characters, Spock and Leonard McCoy, would betray Shatner's James T. Kirk. The script went through multiple revisions to please the cast and Paramount Pictures, including cuts in the effects-laden climax of the film. Despite a writers'-guild strike cutting into the film's pre-production, Paramount commenced filming in October 1988. Many Star Trek veterans assisted in the film's production; art director Nilo Rodis developed the designs {{for many of the}} film's locales, shots, and characters, while Herman Zimmerman served as its production designer. Production problems plagued the film on set and during location shooting in Yosemite National Park and the Mojave Desert. As effects house Industrial Light & Magic's best crews were busy and would be too expensive, the production used Bran Ferren's company for the film's effects, which had to be revised several times in order to lower production costs. The film's ending was reworked because of poor test-audience reaction, and the failure <b>of</b> <b>planned</b> special effects. Jerry Goldsmith, composer for , returned to score The Final Frontier.|$|E
5|$|While {{urban centres}} were rebuilt in local materials, {{including}} Aberdeen in granite and Glasgow in red sandstone, {{the homes of}} the rural poor remained basic, particularly in the Highlands. In the cities they were confined to the sprawl of suburban tenements like those of the Gorbals in Glasgow. One response to growing population was the creation <b>of</b> <b>planned</b> new towns, like those at Inverary and New Lanark. The nineteenth century also was the revival of the Scots Baronial style, pioneered at Walter Scott's Abbotsford House and confirmed in popularity by Queen Victoria's residence at Balmoral Castle. There was also a revival of Gothic styles in church architecture. Neo-classicism continued to be a major movement in the works of architects including William Henry Playfair and Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. The later part of the century also saw {{some of the most important}} architectural products of new engineering, including the iconic Forth Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} plan {{execution}} on agents/robots in highly dy-namic environments. Besides a formal semantics <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> execution and a repre-sentation <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> as programs, we introduce the concept <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> invariants. Plan invariants {{are similar to}} loop invariants in imperative programs in {{that they have to}} be true during the whole plan execution cycle. Once a plan invariant fails the plan execution is stopped and other plans that are more appropriate in the current context are considered for execution instead. The use <b>of</b> <b>plan</b> invariants allows for an early detection <b>of</b> problems. <b>Plan</b> assumptions that are required for a plan to succeed are explicitly represented by plan invariants. ...|$|R
