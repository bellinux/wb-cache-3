In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren's <b>one-two</b> finish allowed them to move within seven points from leaders Ferrari. Williams remained in third on 15 points, with twelve races remaining in the season.|$|E
5000|$|Bertrand {{has been}} {{described}} as a modern-day full-back who gives assistance in attacking down the flanks, keeping and retaining possession as well as defending and reclaiming possession, making quick runs into the box and often does <b>one-two's</b> with his teammates. Bertrand was described by Glenn Roeder, his manager at Norwich, as a defender who [...] "likes to bomb forward and is tenacious in the tackle when defending." ...|$|R
50|$|Bertos {{is known}} for his {{dribbling}} and quality skills on the ball. This was shown in the New Zealand vs Brazil game in which he dribbled around two defenders to win a corner. He also played many <b>one-twos</b> and did a drag-back once in the second half. In {{the first game of the}} New Zealand vs Malaysia series (which New Zealand won 1-0), Bertos received the Man of the Match award for his magnificent dribbling performance and domination of the Malaysian defence.|$|R
5000|$|... {{this was}} the last race where no European driver {{finished}} the race on the podium; two South American drivers and an Asian driver filled the three podium places for this race. It was also the only race where the Larrousse team scored a podium finish, during their eight seasons of competing in Formula One. It was also the first and only podium finish for the Lamborghini V12 engine in Formula One. Moreover, it was also the last of Brazil's eleven <b>one-twos</b> in Formula One, the only one featuring Piquet and Moreno - of the other ten, eight featured Piquet and Senna and the other two, Emerson Fittipaldi and José Carlos Pace.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Häkkinen moved up to second place in the Drivers' Championship, {{reducing}} Michael Schumacher's lead to fourteen points. Coulthard fell to third, two points behind Häkkinen. Barrichello moved up into fourth place on 13 points, and Ralf Schumacher fell to fifth overall. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead but McLaren's <b>one-two</b> finish moved to within seven points clear of the Italian team. Williams maintained third position with nine points. Frentzen's sixth-place finish allowed Jordan to move point clear of Benetton in the battle for fourth, with twelve races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren <b>one-two.</b> Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The IX Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race, held on 8 April 2007 at the Sepang International Circuit and {{the second}} race of the 2007 Formula One season. Reigning world {{champion}} Fernando Alonso won the race from second on the grid, with McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton finishing second. This marked McLaren's first <b>one-two</b> finish since the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. Previous race winner Kimi Räikkönen finished third. Räikkönen's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa started the race from pole position, but was passed by both McLarens {{in the first two}} corners of the first lap, eventually finishing in fifth place behind BMW's Nick Heidfeld.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely to end in a draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of <b>one-twos</b> towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|R
50|$|A {{respected}} and experienced manager, his coaching techniques, especially {{in regards to}} athletic preparation, fitness, and training (a field for which he has a particular interest), are also proverbial for their effort and diligence. Notable features of his system are the use of a high defensive line, the offside trap, high pressing, and zonal marking, as well as short first touch passes and <b>one-twos</b> played on the ground, although the deep-lying playmaker in his formation must also be competent at providing long passes and switching the play. The wingers in his system are set to move inside the channels, and usually play a free creative role. All of these elements combined made Zeman's tactics solid, spectacular and extremely versatile: they are effective against top teams as well as weaker ones.|$|R
50|$|St Aimie scored {{his first}} goal three games {{into the season}} on 18 August 2012 against Braintree Town, scoring the 2nd goal of the game on 18 minutes, {{slotting}} home Steven Leslie's flick-on from Luke Hubbins' right wing cross, Telford {{went on to a}} 3-0 victory. On 25 August 2012 he scored a decisive goal four minutes before half time at Luton Town, Steven Leslie's perfectly placed free-kick for St Aimie to head home past Mark Tyler. Two days later he scored a 56th-minute equaliser against Stockport County, good work from Luke Hubbins playing a couple of <b>one-two's</b> with Steven Leslie to slide the ball across for St Aimie to sidefoot home from close range, the game finishing a 2-2 stalemate. On 1 September 2012, he scored the 3rd and final goal of the game, a powerful header in the 57th minute from Steven Leslie's right-wing corner, to make it 0-3 away at Southport.|$|R
5|$|The result meant Hamilton {{extended}} his {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship to 14 points over Button. Vettel's third-place finish allowed him to tie with Webber in third place on 136 points, and Alonso's victory resulted in the Spanish driver reducing the deficit to be within 13 points of the Red Bull driver. McLaren maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship although Red Bull's finish of third and sixth meant they reduced the gap by one point. Ferrari's <b>one-two</b> result allowed them to reduce the points deficit to Red Bull slightly. Mercedes and Renault remained in fourth and fifth positions, with eight races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a <b>one-two</b> with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{athletic}} event {{held at the}} stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize. Attracted by a prize fund of £500 and the imminent AAA Championships in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion Murray Halberg and Peter Snell, the reigning 800m Olympic champion. Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the mile {{with a time of}} 4:03:70 and Snell led a New Zealand <b>one-two</b> in the 880-yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.|$|E
5000|$|A showman {{who liked}} to {{entertain}} the crowd, {{he was able to}} cut the ball with sufficient spin that it would roll towards an opponent only to stop and then return to him as though on a string. He was also adept at back heeling penalty kicks into the goal. He would rarely track back and defend however, and antics were sometimes criticised as [...] "unsportsman-like". On one occasion, 2-1 up against Arsenal with 5 minutes to go, he dribbled the ball into The Gunners' penalty area before putting his foot on it, pretending to comb his hair while looking at his watch. Other examples include mocking opposition full-backs by playing <b>one-twos</b> with the corner flag, literally sitting on the ball to torment defenders who couldn't dispossess him, and teasing a beaten goalkeeper by putting his foot on the ball on the goal line. Sunderland teammate Trevor Ford wrote in his autobiography that: [...] "where did it antics get us? Precisely nowhere. The result was that when he did make a move, the opposing defence was in position and the attack broke down. Time and again when I thought Shack was going to slip a goalscoring pass to me he would veer off". However Billy Bingham defended Shackleton by noting that Ford had poor positional skills.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} other similar {{variants}} upon the advanced playmaking role. Other advanced playmakers seemingly {{operate as a}} free, creative second striker, or inside-forward, often playing on the wing, alongside a main striker, or even down {{the centre of the}} pitch, and then falling back into a deeper role to link up the midfield and the attack. Attacking midfielder/playmaker Michel Platini would describe this more advanced creative role (exemplified by Roberto Baggio) as a nine and a half ("nove e mezzo" [...] in Italian), as it was halfway between the role of a goalscoring forward (shirt number 9) and a playmaking attacking midfielder (shirt number 10). This position allowed these technical players to make dribbling runs, and score many goals as well as assisting them. Unlike a pure number ten playmaker, however, the nine and a half/supporting forward does not usually participate in the build-up play as much as an attacking midfielder would. Their role is primarily that of an assist-provider, who can play <b>one-twos</b> as well as hold up and lay-off the ball for more offensive teammates; as the supporting forward initially originated from free-role attacking midfielders adapting to a more advanced position in the tactically rigorous 4-4-2 formations of the 1990s, their defensive contribution is also usually higher than that of a pure number ten playmaker. In Italy, this role is known as a [...] "rifinitore" [...] or [...] "seconda punta", whereas in Brazil, it is known as a [...] "segundo atacante" [...] or [...] "ponta-de-lança".|$|R
5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a <b>one-two</b> with Larsson, and then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a <b>one-two,</b> she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|Klose's goal {{initiated}} {{a flurry of}} German scoring as Brazil {{lost control of the}} game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike {{from the edge of the}} area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a <b>one-two</b> with Khedira before scoring again. Kroos' goals came just 70 seconds apart. Khedira himself scored in the 29th minute after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil. All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. Brazil had no shots on target in the first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly in shock or reduced to tears. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Nani {{began the}} new season by putting in {{a man of the}} match {{performance}} and scoring twice against derby rivals Manchester City in the 2011 Community Shield, including a 94th-minute winner, as United came from two goals down to win 3–2 on 7 August 2011. He scored his first league goal of the 2011–12 season by netting United's fifth goal in an 8–2 victory over Arsenal on 28 August. Nani made his 100th Premier League appearance on 18 September as he scored in a 3–1 home win over Chelsea. He scored with a long-range strike after cutting inside from the right wing. He was also awarded with the man of the match. In United's following league match at the Britannia Stadium, Nani scored his third goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Stoke City. He played a neat <b>one-two</b> with Darren Fletcher before making his way through Stoke's defence and firing a low shot inside the left post. Nani started the match against Manchester City where they fell victim to a 1–6 beating at home to their neighbours. On 1 November, Nani was shortlisted for the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or.|$|E
5|$|Standing at 6 feet 4 {{inches tall}} (1.93 m) and {{weighing}} 220 pounds (100kg), Wade is a shooting guard {{that is also}} capable of playing point guard as he did during his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups. On offense, he has established himself {{as one of the}} quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well {{as one of the best}} slashers in the NBA. Wade's signature <b>one-two</b> step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot. Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently; he ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA. He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive <b>one-two</b> finish.|$|E
5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected the ball from midfield and played a <b>one-two</b> with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off and looked up before curling the ball from 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{went into}} the first leg in Glasgow as massive underdogs, and the match {{seemed to be going}} as {{expected}} when 17 year old Michael Owen put the English side ahead on 6 minutes. Celtic continued to struggle during the opening 20 minutes, but began to find form as the first half progressed. The start of the second half saw Celtic pushing forward more and they equalised on 53 minutes. Jackie McNamara raced down the right wing, played a <b>one-two</b> with Craig Burley, then volleyed a powerful shot past David James. Simon Donnelly hit the post on 62 minutes, then a minute later the referee ignored {{what appeared to be a}} blatant foul on him in the penalty box. Celtic continued to press forward, and on 73 minutes were awarded a penalty when Larsson fell on being challenged by David James in the penalty box. Donnelly converted the resultant spot kick to put Celtic ahead. With full-time approaching, Steve McManaman picked the ball from inside his own half, dribbled 70 yards to the edge of the Celtic penalty box and curled a shot in to level the match at 22. The return match at Anfield produced fewer chances and no goals, seeing Liverpool knock out Celtic on away goals.|$|E
5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a <b>one-two</b> with Larsson, then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E
5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a <b>one–two</b> with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's luck would run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and nudged the barriers with his nose assembly, bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the chequered flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury returnee, Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E
5|$|He scored 14 {{goals in}} the 1970–71 campaign, the highest tally he ever recorded, {{including}} one in a 5–0 victory over Arsenal on 26 September that came third in the BBC Goal of the Season competition. The goal came after he played a <b>one-two</b> with Peter Dobing before striking a first-time shot into the net from 25-yards. Stoke reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time}} since 1899 in 1970–71, where they lost 2–0 to Arsenal after a replay; in the original tie Stoke had led 2–1 before conceding an equaliser five minutes into injury time. Conroy played in 19 of Stoke's 21 FA Cup and League Cup games in the 1971–72 season, as they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the League Cup. In the League Cup Stoke defeated Southport, Oxford United (after a replay), Manchester United (after two replays), Bristol Rovers and West Ham United (after two replays) to reach the Wembley final against Chelsea. Conroy was a key figure in the semi-final decider at Old Trafford against West Ham, as he won a penalty in the first half and then scored the winning goal on 49 minutes with a 25-yard volley. He also opened the scoring in the final itself, as he converted a simple header after five minutes, and helped Stoke to go on to secure the first trophy in the club's history with a 2–1 victory. Stoke also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, again losing to Arsenal, though Conroy missed this game as he was sidelined for the rest of the season after he injured his cartilage again in a defeat to Leeds United on 8 April.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, at {{the spring}} Talladega race, Gilliland pushed FRM {{teammate}} David Ragan {{to victory in}} a green-white-checkered finish that saw Gilliland notch a career-best finish of second, giving FRM a <b>one-two</b> finish in the race.|$|E
25|$|Dismantled {{and shipped}} to France, the RB-1 was flown by Howard Rinehart in the 28 September 1920 race, but was forced to {{withdraw}} after a cable failure prevented full retraction of the gear/flap mechanism, allowing the two Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racers to make a <b>one-two</b> finish.|$|E
