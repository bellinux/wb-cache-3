40|$|Summary. In the {{framework}} of clustering, the usual aim is to cluster observations and not variables. However the issue <b>of</b> clustering <b>variables</b> clearly appears for di-mension reduction, selection <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> or in some case studies. A simple approach for the clustering <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> could be to construct a dissimilarity matrix between the variables and to apply classical clustering methods. But specific methods {{have been developed for}} the clustering <b>of</b> <b>variables.</b> In this context center-based cluster-ing algorithms have been proposed for the clustering <b>of</b> quantitative <b>variables.</b> In this article we extend this approach to categorical variables. The homogeneity crite-rion of a cluster <b>of</b> categorical <b>variables</b> is based on correlation ratios and Multiple Correspondence Analysis is used to determine the latent <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> each cluster. A simulation study shows that the method recovers well the underlying simulated clusters <b>of</b> <b>variables.</b> Finally an application on a real data set also highlights the practical benefits of the proposed approach. Key words: clustering <b>of</b> <b>variables,</b> center-based clustering algorithm, latent vari-able, Multiple Correspondence Analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Large scale genomic {{studies with}} {{multiple}} phenotypic or genotypic measures may require {{the identification of}} complex multivariate relationships. In multivariate analysis a common way to inspect the relationship between two sets <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> based on their correlation is canonical correlation analysis, which determines linear combinations <b>of</b> all <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> each type with maximal correlation between the two linear combinations. However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets <b>of</b> <b>variables,</b> i. e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) which examines the relationships between two types <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> each type by maximizing {{the correlation between the}} subsets <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> different types while performing variable selection.
