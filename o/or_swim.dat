5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish).|$|E
5|$|There are, however, {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film's {{depiction of}} the Normandy campaign. At {{the time of the}} mission, American forces from the two American beach areas, Utah and Omaha, had not yet linked up. In reality, a Ranger team operating out of the Omaha beach area would have had to move through the heavily enemy-occupied city of Carentan, <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> or boat across the estuary linking Carentan to the channel, or transfer by boat to the Utah landing area. On the other hand, US forces moving out of Utah would have had direct and much shorter routes, relatively unencumbered by enemy positions, and were already in contact with some teams from both US airborne divisions landed in the area.|$|E

25|$|Biofilms may form {{on living}} or non-living {{surfaces}} {{and can be}} prevalent in natural, industrial and hospital settings. The microbial cells growing in a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same organism, which, by contrast, are single-cells that may float <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> in a liquid medium. Biofilms can be present on the teeth of most animals as dental plaque, where they may cause tooth decay and gum disease.|$|E
25|$|The fish {{approaching}} the ladder smell the attraction water, recognizing {{the scent of}} Lake Washington and its tributaries. They enter the ladder, and either jump over each of the 21 weirs <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> though tunnel-like openings. They exit the ladder into the fresh water of Salmon Bay. They continue following the waterway to the lake, river, or stream where they were born. Once there, the females lay eggs, which the males fertilize. Most salmon die shortly after spawning.|$|E

25|$|Some species try to bite immediately. Some {{will use}} their heads as sledgehammers and {{literally}} smash an opponent, some will rush <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> toward {{the threat from}} a distance, even chasing the opponent onto land or galloping after it. The main weapon in all crocodiles is the bite, which can generate very high bite force. Many species also possess canine-like teeth. These are used primarily for seizing prey, but are also used in fighting and display.|$|E
25|$|Alligators are {{generally}} timid towards humans {{and tend to}} walk <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> away if one approaches. This has led some people {{to the practice of}} approaching alligators and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.|$|E
25|$|A {{pattern of}} two breaths per diver should be {{established}} {{as soon as possible}} and then terminate the dive and start the ascent as soon as possible, as air consumption while buddy breathing is usually more than double the normal rate. Most demand valves will only drain correctly if the hose is to the user's right, and in these cases the divers should align themselves to allow convenient movement of the demand valve from donor to recipient and back. When the divers need to ascend <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> horizontally, it requires co-ordination and some skill, which is best practiced in a low hazard environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} of St Mark's College {{was driven by}} the demand for student accommodation, which the University of Adelaide did not provide at the time. The founders of the University believed that learning thrives best on 'haggis in a hovel', and that consequently there was no necessity {{for the provision of}} residence or its official control. It was thought that students should receive no tutorial assistance but rather sink <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> on a few lectures from their professors each week. The Reverend Julian Bickersteth led the drive to establish a residential college, with the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Adelaide appointing a committee to that end in September 1920.|$|E
25|$|In July 2002, The Waifs, Butler, and Stevens, {{founded the}} {{independent}} label Jarrah Records. The label was initially {{set up to}} issue both artists' material in North America, later it handled all their Australian releases. The growing international reputation of The Waifs led {{to the release of}} Sink <b>or</b> <b>Swim</b> in the US in 2002 by Jarrah Records. The Waifs first new work for Jarrah was a five-track EP, London Still, which appeared in July and reached the top50 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In October, London Still received two nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 for 'Best Independent Release' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'.|$|E
25|$|Davison {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the season eighteen closer, Logopolis, although it was to be a year until his first full season in the part began in 1982. In the meantime Alan Hart, Controller of BBC 1, had decided to move the programme from an autumn to a spring transmission slot. This was partly because, after eighteen years on Saturday evenings, he had also decided to change the transmission date, running the series twice-weekly on weekdays instead of once a week on Saturdays. This had the effect of halving the number of weeks the series was on-air to thirteen instead of twenty-six, and moving from an autumn to a spring debut. Additionally, Davison was also working on the BBC sit com Sink <b>or</b> <b>Swim</b> and was unavailable to record enough episodes to make an autumn start date viable.|$|E

I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink <b>or</b> <b>swim...</b> I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2005–06 season, the Islanders lost {{several key}} players to free agency or {{retirement}} and significantly retooled their roster. Captain Michael Peca {{was traded to}} free up room to sign free agents such as high-scoring wing Miroslav Šatan and Yashin became team captain. Journalists suggested that the team had finally been built around Yashin and would sink <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> with his performance. A common defence of Yashin's decreased offensive output had been {{the lack of a}} legitimate first line winger to play with him. Satan and Yashin showed signs of chemistry early in the season, but generally produced disappointing results. When Satan was moved off Yashin's line, his offensive output increased markedly. After the season ended with the Islanders out of the playoffs {{for the first time since}} his arrival, Yashin acknowledged that he needed to score more. After the season ended, there had been speculation that the Islanders would buy out his contract and rebuild in a different image, but the team decided to retain him.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink <b>or</b> <b>swim,</b> and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, the Indians had one {{of their}} finest seasons, though Feller {{experienced}} a season that had more ups and downs. Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh {{time in his career}} in the 1948 All-Star Game but declined to play, feeling that his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point he was winless for a month, and by July 22, his record was 9–12. Lou Boudreau, the Indians' player-manager, declared [...] "we sink <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> with Feller", and continued to pick him. Feller proceeded to go 10–3 for the remainder of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19–15, a league-leading 164 strikeouts, and a 3.56ERA. The Indians won a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox to determine the team to represent the AL in the World Series; {{it was the first time}} the team had won the pennant since the 1920 season.|$|E
500|$|Sonic Advance is a side-scrolling, action-platform game {{reminiscent}} of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis. Players journey through the fictional South Island to defeat Doctor Eggman, who is attempting to capture the island's animal population {{to turn them into}} evil robots. At the game's start, players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Sonic the Hedgehog is the fastest and can perform an [...] "insta-shield" [...] that protects him for a brief moment; Tails can fly <b>or</b> <b>swim</b> for a short amount of time; Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air and climb walls; and Amy Rose can destroy enemies using her hammer. With the exception of Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a cheat code, players can also control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.|$|E
