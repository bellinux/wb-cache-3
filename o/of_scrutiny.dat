5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic <b>of</b> {{individual}} parliamentary <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> European affairs in Slovakia. The aim of this thesis is to determine which factors influenced the formally strong system <b>of</b> parliamentary <b>scrutiny</b> in the Slovak National Assembly. 6 factors will be analyzed - Late accession to the EU, parliamentary strength, bargaining strength in the Council of EU, public euroscepticism, euroscepticism of political parties {{and the frequency of}} coalition and minority governments. The strength <b>of</b> parliamentary <b>scrutiny</b> can also be influenced by informal aspects. The informal aspects in this thesis will be mainly concerned with the efforts {{of the members of the}} European Affairs Committee to acquire additional information about legislative proposals of the EU in an informal way and also their efforts for a better cooperation in parliamentary scrutiny among various political parties. The empirical analysis found, that the factor of late accession to the EU and euroscepticism of political parties had the biggest effect on the formally strong system <b>of</b> parliamentary <b>scrutiny</b> in Slovakia. A partial effect can be also attributed to the factors of public euroscepticism and the frequency of coalition and minority governments.
