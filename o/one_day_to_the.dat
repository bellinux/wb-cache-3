25|$|Colston Hall {{was popular}} for wrestling matches from 1951. By {{the end of}} the decade, demand for matches was so strong that seats were block booked from <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. Harold Sakata made several wrestling {{appearances}} there before moving into acting in the 1960s. The last match was held in 2004; though an official reason was not given, locals believe it was no longer an appropriate image for Colston Hall.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Wheatstone {{translated}} French poetry, {{and wrote}} two songs, {{one of which was}} given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew's composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. Small for his age, but with a fine brow, and intelligent blue eyes, he often visited an old book-stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket-money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science. <b>One</b> <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he could buy a dictionary. Then he began to read the volume, and, {{with the help of his}} elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home-made battery, in the scullery behind his father's house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper-plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, 'We must use the pennies themselves,' said he, and the battery was soon complete.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} 16, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} two century breaks to whitewash Lee 5–0 for his 13th consecutive win and his 9th consecutive quarter-final. Regarding comments he made about his retirement after his previous match, O'Sullivan said, [...] "There's no point quoting me because what I say from <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next will be different". Maguire made a [...] of 140 in his 5–2 win over Ding, while Hamilton defeated Williams 5–3 for his fourth consecutive {{win over the}} world number two. Hendry, whose last tournament victory was this event last year, made four breaks over 60 in his 5–2 win over Carter {{to set up a}} match with Higgins, who made the highest break so far with a 141 in his 5–3 win over Pinches. Doherty became the fifth member of the top eight to lose when he was defeated 4–5 by Hicks, while Hawkins defeated Bingham 5–4 and Murphy beat Holt 5–3.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{clock in}} the Jewish scheme, so that the local civil clock is used. Though the civil clock, {{including}} the one in use in Israel, incorporates local adoptions of various conventions such as time zones, standard times and daylight saving, these {{have no place in}} the Jewish scheme. The civil clock is used only as a reference point – in expressions such as: [...] "Shabbat starts at ...". The steady progression of sunset around the world and seasonal changes results in gradual civil time changes from <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next based on observable astronomical phenomena (the sunset) and not on man-made laws and conventions.|$|E
2500|$|This {{exception}} {{saved the}} Ambrosian Rite, the Mozarabic Rite, {{as well as}} a few ancient modified forms of the Roman Rite, such as the Dominican, Carmelite, and Carthusian Missals. The differences in these Missals, however, hardly affect the Roman Canon, except in one or two unimportant rubrics. Since Pius V, the Canon, then, with the very slight retouches under Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, has been brought back to its original simplicity and remains unchanged throughout the year, except that on a few of the very greatest feasts slight additions are made to the [...] "Communicantes" [...] and the [...] "Hanc igitur", and on <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Qui pridie quam pateretur".|$|E
2500|$|In the astronomical-lunar-{{calendar}} system, {{a year of}} 12 lunar {{months is}} 354.37 days long. [...] In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely {{at the time of}} the monthly [...] "conjunction", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gregorian calendar every four years. The technical details of the adjustment are described in Tabular Islamic calendar.|$|E

2500|$|The Taínos {{had their}} own culture, customs and {{governing}} structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the [...] "Areyto" [...] which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about {{the traditions of the}} Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an [...] "Areyto" [...] in the following manner: [...] "And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call 'areytos,' were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) (...) was the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's {{favorite}} cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{sounds of}} the Adhan, the Muslim daily call to prayer. Preparing to attend, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on {{the sleeve of his}} prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times. While the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it {{does not appear to be}} attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said [...] "nothing changed".|$|E
