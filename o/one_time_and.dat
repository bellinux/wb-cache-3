5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Grandmaster (shortened as GM; {{sometimes}} International Grandmaster or IGM is used) {{is awarded}} to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster {{is the highest}} title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo chess rating (see below) of at least 2500 at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bennett {{noted that the}} two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were {{precisely}} separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> P. sternbergi (or Geosternbergia) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps.|$|E

Underworlds music is purely orchestral in style. There are pieces that do not loop, meaning they will only play <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> will be triggered on specific events. The score is made more of musical fragments, similar to the first five games of the Tomb Raider series, and there is less constant music than in Legend.|$|E
5|$|All {{of what is}} now NY31F was {{originally}} designated as part of Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 entered the village of Macedon on modern NY31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY96. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to utilize modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY31F was part of a legislative route at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> was state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted route number until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose ownership is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} distress call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons at any <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> they must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Micro-Volunteering is the {{phenomenon}} of volunteering <b>one's</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy for extremely short periods of time. It is often considered a subset of Virtual Volunteering where one can volunteer <b>one's</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy via the Internet. There are many successful examples of Virtual Volunteering such as the Gutenberg project and the Librivox project. However, in both these cases, a volunteer must donate {{a substantial amount of}} his or her time in activities such as reading books or proofreading books. This paper examines the concept of synchronous micro-volunteering where potential volunteers can effectively donate as little as 10 minutes of their <b>time</b> <b>and</b> immediately assist other people. The paper then describes the architecture which supports synchronous micro-volunteering. Keywords-component; micro-volunteering, dr math, mxit I...|$|R
