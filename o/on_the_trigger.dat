5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|E

In 1994, after failing in a {{previous}} bid for Histadrut leadership, Peretz joined forces with Haim Ramon to contest control of the then powerful trade union federation. They ran on an independent list against the favoured candidate of then Labor leader Yitzhak Rabin. They won, and Peretz became Ramon's deputy at the Histadrut, isolating him within the Labor Party. He became chairman of the Histadrut in December 1995, when Ramon reentered the cabinet following Rabin's assassination. During his early years {{at the helm of the}} Histadrut, Peretz was regarded as a militant firebrand, with an easy hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> of general strikes.

2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, the sear effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above. The end of the sear arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety here that is of vital importance: the [...] "hole" [...] {{in the side of}} the wheel into which the sear engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> to disengage the sear. Nor is the tip of the sear arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the [...] "hole" [...] is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and the sear has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on the sear.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of the static and dynamic stress changes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> of faults under slip-dependent friction law. We specifically focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2000 Western Tottori (Japan) earthquake and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> of its largest aftershock. To this end we compute the dynamic and static stress changes caused by the 2000 Western Tottori (Japan) earthquake for which a good knowledge of the rupture history and aftershock sequence exists. We compute the coseismic stress evolution caused by <b>the</b> mainshock fault, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault plane of the largest aftershock located 20 km SW of the mainshock. The static stress changes cannot explain the occurrence of the largest aftershock, located in a stress shadow whatever the friction coefficient that we use. Hence we propose that dynamic stresses have promoted <b>the</b> <b>triggering</b> of <b>the</b> largest aftershock. Using the discrete wavenumber and the reflectivity methods we compute the complete time-dependent coulomb failure function CFF(t). We investigate the influence of the adopted coefficient of friction μ, the depth and the location of <b>the</b> hypocenter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shape of the CFF(t). Finally, using a non-linear slip dependent friction law with a stability/instability transition, we constrain the frictional properties of the largest aftershock fault plane knowing the state of stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault and the time delay of 48 hours. We propose that Dc must be greater than 0. 3 m...|$|R
