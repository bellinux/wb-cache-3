5|$|In adults {{short term}} use <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number <b>of</b> <b>nasal,</b> facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} record <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> irrigation {{is found}} in the ancient Hindu practice of Ayurveda whose roots are traced to the Vedas. It was customary to perform jala-neti daily, as part of soucha (personal hygiene according to scriptures). The simplest method <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> irrigation, that is to sniff water from cupped hands and then blow it out, is also a step in the ablution practices (Wudu) of Muslims.|$|E
50|$|This small {{consonant}} inventory {{is typical}} of Lakes Plain languages. The complete lack <b>of</b> <b>nasals</b> is also a feature of these languages.|$|R

25|$|A later merger <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> codas as /ŋ/ {{occurred}} in Pu–Xian and some Eastern Min dialects, including Fuzhou, Fuding and Gutian, but not Fu'an and Ningde. A partial merger {{occurred in}} Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shantou, where -n merged with -ŋ.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women.

50|$|The {{acquisition}} <b>of</b> <b>nasals</b> in German {{differs from}} that of Dutch, a phonologically closely related language. German children produce proportionately more nasals in onset position (sounds before a vowel in a syllable) than Dutch children do. German children, once they reached 16 months old, also produced significantly more nasals in syllables containing schwas, when compared with Dutch-speaking children. This may reflect differences in the languages the children are being exposed to, although the researchers claim that the development <b>of</b> <b>nasals</b> likely cannot be seen apart from the more general phonological system the child is developing.|$|R

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts, because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> skin, better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting, nasal skin is the best source <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> skin. Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal skin flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|E
25|$|The third process, nasal substitution, also {{presents}} two varieties. Both varieties <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> substitution affect adjacent consonants {{of the same}} type: alveolar (coronal), bilabial, or velar. The first variety is often triggered by reduplication, resulting in spelling changes: sel is reduplicated to sensel ("tired").|$|E
25|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> congestion, sinus congestion and Eustachian tube congestion.

25|$|The {{different}} systems {{used to write}} Ojibwe are typically distinguished by their representation of key features of the Ojibwe inventory of sounds. Differences include: the representation of vowel length, the representation <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> vowels, the representation of fortis and lenis consonants; and the representation of consonants which require an International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbol that differs significantly from the conventional alphabetic symbol.|$|E
25|$|Sinus {{infections are}} treated by {{prolonged}} courses of antibiotics. The development <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, {{and over time}} reduce the person's sense of smell.

The upper prong of this bone is embedded into the forehead, while the two lower prongs attach to the sides of the skull. At the base of the {{upper mandible}} a thin sheet <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> bones is attached to the skull at the nasofrontal hinge, which gives mobility to the upper mandible, allowing it to move upwards and downwards.|$|E
40|$|A case of solitary fibrous tumour <b>of</b> the <b>nasal</b> cavity is reported.

5000|$|Nasalisation, {{also known}} as eclipsis in Modern Irish grammar, is the {{prepending}} <b>of</b> a <b>nasal</b> consonant to the word.

Due to later changes involving clusters <b>of</b> <b>nasals</b> and other consonants, in particular the coaliscing of nasal-stop clusters to voiceless plosives (such as [...] > [...] ), nasalisation may also manifest itself as voicing in Old Irish.|$|R

25|$|Based {{upon the}} {{available}} area <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> skin, the surgeon selects the locale for the bilobed flap, and orients the pedicle. If the defect {{is in the}} lateral aspect of the nose, the pedicle is based medially. If the defect is at the nasal tip, or at the nasal dorsum, the pedicle is based laterally. An ideal location for the second flap is along the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral nasal wall.|$|E
25|$|Many {{kinds of}} leprosy are known, but some {{symptoms}} {{are common to}} them, including runny nose, dry scalp, eye problems, skin lesions, muscle weakness, reddish skin, smooth, shiny, diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand, loss of sensation in fingers and toes, thickening of peripheral nerves, and flat nose due to destruction <b>of</b> <b>nasal</b> cartilage. Also, phonation and resonation of sound occur during speech. Often, atrophy of the testes with resulting impotence occurs.|$|E
