5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team <b>of</b> <b>attorneys,</b> which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is an attempt to}} {{determine}} the legal nature of establishing a proxy, or giving a power <b>of</b> <b>attorney,</b> and in particular to identify the recipient of the power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted by way of a statement of will of the person establishing a proxy. Further, the role of a proxy in the creation of an effective power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is analyzed. Issues such as the form, contents, legal effects of a power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> granted, or its active or passive legitimization are not discussed. In the author's opinion, the granting of a power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is a one-sided legal act the effects of which exist independently of the internal relations between the person establishing a proxy and the person to whom a power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is given. A statement of will of the person establishing a proxy is made in favour of the person receiving the power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>of</b> which he is only recipient. Accepting the granted power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> is an intrinsic element of the proxy being established and effective. Such an acceptance consists in an inclusion in the statement of will of the person establishing a proxy of the consent of the recipient of the proxy to receive the power <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> so given. Such a statement, however, {{does not need to be}} specifically addressed and submitted, and may take a form the proxy so established commencing to exercise the granted powers <b>of</b> <b>attorney...</b>|$|R
