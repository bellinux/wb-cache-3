5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on <b>occultation</b> data from an <b>occultation</b> on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself was suggested in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 <b>occultation</b> observations. Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{the first}} {{asteroid}} for which an <b>occultation</b> was observed. It passed {{in front of a}} dim star (SAO 112328) on February 19, 1958. Since then, several occultations by Juno have been observed, the most fruitful being the <b>occultation</b> of SAO 115946 on December 11, 1979, which was registered by 18 observers.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{has been}} {{observed}} occulting stars several times, including the best observed of all asteroid <b>occultation</b> events on 29 May 1983, when careful <b>occultation</b> timing measurements were taken by 140 observers. These resulted in the first accurate measurements of its diameter.|$|E
40|$|Predictions are {{presented}} for 54 <b>occultations</b> by Uranus' ring system, 24 <b>occultations</b> by Uranus, 22 <b>occultations</b> by Neptune, and ten possible <b>occultations</b> by Pluto {{during the period}} 1985 through 1990. Notable <b>occultations</b> by Uranus occur 24 May 1985, 16 April 1987, 27 May 1990, 21 June 1990, and 7 August 1990. The best Neptune <b>occultations</b> are on 7 June 1985 and 25 May 1990. Of the Pluto events, there are six which are nominally observable somewhere on the earth, although uncertainties in Pluto's position combined with uncertainties in the star positions preclude prediction of a ground track until just before the events...|$|R
40|$|Approximate {{signal-to-noise}} ratios {{are calculated}} for 12 stellar <b>occultations</b> by the rings of Uranus during 1977 - 1980. Four {{of the stars}} are apparently bright enough to permit observation of the epsilon-ring <b>occultations</b> with a large telescope. For {{the best of these}} events, <b>occultations</b> by rings alpha through delta should also be observable with a large telescope, and epsilon-ring <b>occultations</b> should be detectable with smaller telescopes. Formulas for the signal-to-noise ratios are given to aid potential observers in evaluating the quality of the results they can expect to obtain with their own photometric equipment...|$|R

5|$|In 1972, {{a team of}} Indian, British and American astronomers {{working in}} Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had {{detected}} a thin atmosphere during an <b>occultation,</b> when it and Jupiter passed {{in front of a}} star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa. However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an <b>occultation</b> of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The <b>occultation</b> measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 µPa. The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio <b>occultation</b> experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many <b>occultation</b> observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|A stellar <b>occultation</b> {{observed}} on 21 January 2017 and described in an 11 October 2017 Nature paper indicated {{the presence of}} a ring around Haumea. This represents the first ring system discovered for a TNO.|$|E
50|$|The {{accurate}} {{timing of}} lunar <b>occultations</b> is performed regularly by (primarily amateur) astronomers. Lunar <b>occultations</b> timed to an accuracy {{of a few}} tenths of a second have various scientific uses, particularly in refining our knowledge of lunar topography. Photoelectric analysis of lunar <b>occultations</b> have also discovered some stars to be very close visual or spectroscopic binaries. Some angular diameters of stars have been measured by timing of lunar <b>occultations,</b> which is useful for determining effective temperatures of those stars. Early radio astronomers found <b>occultations</b> of radio sources by the Moon valuable for determining their exact positions, because the long wavelength of radio waves limited the resolution available through direct observation. This was crucial for the unambiguous identification of the radio source 3C 273 with the optical quasar and its jet, and a fundamental prerequisite for Maarten Schmidt's discovery of the cosmological nature of quasars.|$|R
40|$|We have {{completed}} {{a search for}} candidates for stellar <b>occultations</b> by Triton over the years 1995 - 1999. CCd strip scan images provided star positions in the relevant sky area {{to a depth of}} about 17. 5 R magnitude. Over this time period, we find that Triton passes within 1. 0 arcsec of 75 stars. Appulses with geocentric minimum separations of less than 0. 35 arcsec will result in stellar <b>occultations,</b> but further astrometry and photometry is necessary to refine individual predictions for identification of actual <b>occultations.</b> Finder charts are included to aid in further studies and prediction refinement.

5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of <b>occultation</b> occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an <b>occultation</b> of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{that the}} rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar <b>occultation</b> in 1984 when the rings {{obscured}} {{a star on}} immersion but not on emersion. Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{discovery of}} the Uranian rings was made by astronomers James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink on March 10, 1977, using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and was serendipitous. They planned to use the <b>occultation</b> of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet's atmosphere. However, when their observations were analyzed, {{they found that the}} star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by the planet. They deduced that a system of narrow rings was present. The five <b>occultation</b> events they observed were denoted by the Greek letters α, β, γ, δ and ε in their papers. These designations have been used as the rings' names since then. Later they found four additional rings: one between the β and γ rings and three inside the α ring. The former was named the η ring. The latter were dubbed rings 4, 5 and 6—according to the numbering of the <b>occultation</b> events in one paper. Uranus's ring system was the second to be discovered in the Solar System, after that of Saturn.|$|E
40|$|<b>Occultations</b> {{of stars}} by planets, satellites, {{planetary}} ring systems, and asteroids offer opportunities {{to study the}} occulting bodies in ways not otherwise possible {{from the surface of}} the Earth. For example, one can detect even an extremely tenuous atmosphere and can measure the temperature and density profiles of the atmosphere in regions not ordinarily sampled by spacecraft. <b>Occultations</b> also permit direct measurement of the size and shape of solar system objects too small to be directly resolved by groundbased telescopes. The accuracy of such determinations is typically 1 - 2 percent and, moreover, is independent of the distance to the object. In this investigation, upcoming <b>occultations</b> through wide-ranging computer searches are identified, and accurate predictions for the more important events are provided. Selected <b>occultations</b> are observed with specially designed portable photometric equipment...|$|R
40|$|The data {{which can}} be {{acquired}} by observing <b>occultations</b> of stars by asteroids, the Pluto-Charon system, and comets using small telescopes are reviewed. A network of small telescopes {{may be the only}} possible means of observing a few specific types of <b>occultations.</b> The <b>occultations</b> are usually sufficiently bright so that small aperture telescopes can easily obtain high signal/noise ratios. The techniques and equipment are accessible to both professional, amateur and student astronomers, which is a favorable situation since {{only a small percentage of}} the nearly-hourly occurrence of <b>occultations</b> of stars by minor and distant planetary bodies are ever observed. Techniques employed for measuring the dimensions of asteroids by combining chords measured by distributed small telescopes are described and examples are provided of asteroids for which complete or incomplete size/density mappings have been made...|$|R

5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major <b>Occultation</b> until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in <b>occultation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought {{he had seen a}} ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar <b>occultation,</b> although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the <b>occultation</b> was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
