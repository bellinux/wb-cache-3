In November 2010, the Bentworth Mummers put on a performance of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen. Bentworth Cricket Club is {{just south of the}} village.

5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, <b>one</b> <b>just</b> going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} churches have since fallen into ruin. Of the 94 medieval parish {{churches in the}} countryside, 91 are still in use. Three were {{abandoned}} following the Reformation, when parishes were merged, and some churches became superfluous. There are in addition three chapel ruins, or ruins of small churches, in the countryside. There are also the ruins of two Cistercian abbeys, one in the countryside and <b>one</b> <b>just</b> outside the city wall of Visby.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, {{such as the}} <b>one</b> <b>just</b> described, use a {{signature}} that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} NY96 between exit29 and NY250 in Perinton {{serves as a}} major {{commercial}} strip, anchored {{by the presence of}} Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NY96 are a series of plazas, beginning with <b>one</b> <b>just</b> north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NY96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there. They used the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including <b>one</b> <b>just</b> north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this <b>one</b> <b>just</b> happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused by}} the pursuit of Bompart by the frigates under George Countess allowed the British to {{dispatch}} a more substantial squadron under Warren to the Donegal coast. Thus when Bompart arrived {{in the lee of}} Tory Island, he soon found himself threatened on all sides by a superior British force. Despite the damage his ships had suffered in the heavy weather conditions, Bompart attempted to escape but was swiftly run down and defeated in battle, his flagship and four frigates being captured and towed into Lough Swilly. Among the prisoners seized on board the flagship was Theobald Wolfe Tone, leader of the United Irishmen, whose capture and subsequent death signified the end of the rebellion. Over the next week, the scattered French survivors desperately attempted to reach the safety of French harbours {{in the face of a}} dozens of British warships cruising along their homeward route. Only three made it, three others being hunted down and captured, <b>one</b> <b>just</b> a few miles from the entrance to Brest. The French never again attempted an invasion of Ireland.|$|E

Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was too quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E
