40|$|The {{benefit of}} trolley truck systems is the {{substitution}} of the diesel fuel by the cheaper and more ecological electrical energy. Trolley trucks are powered by electricity from two <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines,</b> where one is the supply and the other the return conductor.

Automatic guidance prevents the trolley-powered trucks from leaving the track and thus allows higher operating speeds, higher loading capacity, and greater efficiency. Radar is the ideal sensing technique for automatic guidance in such environments. The presented radar system with two-dimensional digital beamforming capability offers a compact measurement solution as it can be installed on top of the truck. Besides the distance measurement, this radar system allows to detect the location and inclination of the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> by digital beamforming in two dimensions.

40|$|Railways are {{the most}} {{energy-efficient}} land-based mode of transport, and electrification is the most energy-efficient way to power the trains. There are many existing solutions to supply the trains with electricity. Regardless of which particular technology is chosen, it is beneficial to interconnect the public power grids to grids supplying power to the railways. This paper shows that the most efficient, flexible, and gentle-for-the-public-grid way of doing that is through power electronic-based power converters. Converters offer great benefits {{regardless of whether the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> are of DC-type or AC type, and regardless of the AC grid frequency. This paper presents neither new theory nor new experimental results. Based on already available information, this paper presents logical arguments leading to this conclusion from collected facts. Over time what used to be advanced and high-cost equipment earlier can nowadays be purchased at reasonable cost. It is obvious that for most electrically-fed railways, the use of modern power converters is attractive. Where the individual trains are high consumers of energy, the railway gradients are substantial, and the public grids feeding the railway are weak, the use of converters would be technically desirable, if not necessary for electrification. It is expected that more high-speed railways will be built, and more existing railways will be electrified in the foreseeable future. This paper could provide some insights to infrastructure owners and decision makers in railway administrations about value additions that converter-fed electric railways would provide.

On 5 December 2010, electronic interlockings were put into operation in Dessau and Raguhn, which replaced all other signal boxes on the section between Dessau and Wolfen. Between the spring of 2012 and the summer of 2013, further work was carried out on the section between Güterglück and Roßlau.

40|$|The {{method by}} which current is {{collected}} from <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> over the tracks via pantographs is widely used to supply power to EMUs and electric locomotives. Pantographs were first installed to trains in operation in Japan in 1914. Then, in 1922, the former Japanese National Railways completed the installation of pantographs to all electric locomotives and EMUs. Thus, pantographs have been playing the main role in current collection for rolling stock in Japan for nearly a century. The most important function required of pantographs is to collect the required current efficiently to vehicles when needed. To do that, pantographs need to have conductivity and capacity appropriate to their usage. These functions also should be maintained even in high speed running. Factors that determine the current collectivity of pantographs are largely classified into two factors: dynamic performance of the pantograph and wear resistance between the contact strip and the contact wire. Pantographs absolutely must follow the vertical deviation of the contact wire even in high speed running without fail. Contact strips are installed {{to the top of}} a pantograph that contacts the contact wire, (Fig. 1). If a pantograph cannot follow the contact wire and contact strips lose contact to the wire while large current is flowing, arcs are generated or current collection worsens. Such a situation is called contact loss. Arcs caused by contact loss increase wear of contact strips and contact wire; and in worse case scenarios, they break both. If contact wire or contact strips wear easily or cause wear on each other, that results in shorter lifespan and increase in maintenance expenses. Based on these factors, the Technical Center is carrying out R&D projects with an aim of extending lifespan of both of contact wires and contact strips by decreasing wear of those. Here I wil...|$|R
40|$|As in {{many other}} industries, such as {{construction}} and agriculture, overhead electric power lines are a serious hazard at mining and mining-related operations. Even when excluding injuries that occur during electrical maintenance work, over one fourth of electrical fatalities in the mining industry are due to accidental <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> <b>contacts,</b> and for each fatality nearly two serious non-fatal injuries occur due to such contacts. In incidents involving high-reaching mobile equipment, many of the victims touched the equipment after the fact, unaware that the machine frame had become energized by the <b>line</b> <b>contact.</b> MSHA data for accidents involving <b>overhead</b> power <b>line</b> <b>contacts</b> in the mining industry between 1980 and 1997 reveal that in 57 % of the cases personnel were unaware of the accidental <b>line</b> <b>contact</b> until after one or more workers touched the equipment or a hoisted load and were injured. The situation is similar in the construction industry, where according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) data at least 20 % of such victims are unaware of the <b>line</b> <b>contact.</b> This suggests that a device that alerts workers when a power <b>line</b> has been <b>contacted</b> could help prevent many of these injuries.

For {{the scope of this}} paper, the simulation means the simulation of quality of electric energy with the main focus on voltage and harmonic frequencies of current in distribution network. The point of connection of distribution network to the traction network was chosen as the point where measurements were taken and simulation was done. Introduction part deals with AC and DC traction network. Then the article discusses the problem of modeling of different parts of the distribution network and traction network, such as: <b>overhead</b> <b>line,</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> Filtration Compensation Equipment, twelve-pulse rectifier, three-phase three-wire transformer, traction transformer and load of railway tractive stock. The mathematical model of each part was drawn-up leading in a complex model of DC traction network connected to the 22 kV distribution network and the complex model of the one-phase AC traction network to the 110 kV distribution network. Software Pspice was employed to obtain simulations of particular components. Results of those simulations were compared with experimental measurements which were taken at the railway lap of traction current converter plant Hoštka – Mělník (for DC traction network) and at the railway lap of the traction sub-station Bohatice (for AC traction network). Based on comparision of measured and simulated data of AC and DC traction network it could be concluded that current harmonic frequencies take similar values, particular diferences are discussed in the paper. Another conclusion is that measeured and simulated data do not meet limits for harmonic frequencies of current given by standards PNE 33 3430 and ČSN IEC 61 000 - 3 - 4.

40|$|Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor {{technology}} has been attracting substantial industrial interests for the last decade. FBG sensors have seen increasing acceptance and widespread use for structural sensing and health monitoring applications in composites, civil engineering, aerospace, marine, oil & gas, and smart structures. One transportation system that has been benefited tremendously from this technology is railways, where it is {{of the utmost importance}} to understand the structural and operating conditions of rails {{as well as that of}} freight and passenger service cars to ensure safe and reliable operation. Fiber-optic sensors, mostly in the form of FBGs, offer various important characteristics, such as EMI/RFI immunity, multiplexing capability, and very long-range interrogation (up to 230 km between FBGs and measurement unit), over the conventional electrical sensors for the distinctive operational conditions in railways. FBG sensors are unique from other types of fiber-optic sensors as the measured information is wavelength-encoded, which provides self-referencing and renders their signals less susceptible to intensity fluctuations. In addition, FBGs are reflective sensors that can be interrogated from either end, providing redundancy to FBG sensing networks. These two unique features are particularly important for the railway industry where safe and reliable operations are the major concerns. Furthermore, FBGs are very versatile and transducers based on FBGs can be designed to measure a wide range of parameters such as acceleration and inclination. Consequently, a single interrogator can deal with a large number of FBG sensors to measure a multitude of parameters at different locations that spans over a large area. FBG is the most promising, cost-effective and distributed {{sensor technology}} that provides an ideal platform to monitor the condition and structural health of tracks, carriages and underframe equipment in railway systems. In the last few years, a number of field trial railway projects using FBG sensors for axle counting, track and train vibration measurements, monitoring of bogie conditions, structural health monitoring of train bodies, and interaction between <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> and current collectors (pantograph) were successfully conducted by a few research institutions. These studies demonstrated the superiority of FBG sensors over conventional sensors in many crucial aspects.
