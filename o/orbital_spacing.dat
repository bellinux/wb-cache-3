40|$|The {{solar system}} has changed {{dramatically}} since its birth, and so did our understanding of it. A considerable research effort has been invested {{in the past decade}} in an attempt to reconstruct the solar system history, including the earliest stages some 4. 5 billion years ago. The results indicate how several processes, such as planetary migration and dynamical instabilities, acted to relax the <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing</b> of the outer planets, and provided the needed perturbation to explain the present planetary orbits that are not precisely circular and coplanar. Here we highlight this work and illustrate the key results in a computer simulation that unifies several recently developed theories. The emerging view represents another step away from the initial perception of the solar system as part of unchanging heavens...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} a number of inferences as to the origin of planetary bodies, taking into account the present dynamical state of the solar system and some of the limitations which apply to the considered conclusions. Attention is given to the dynamical processes, specifically those processes which may have influenced the orbital or rotational properties of the planets and satellites. Collisional processes are explored, taking into consideration <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing,</b> planetary rotation, and stochastic effects. In connection with a discussion of the evolution of rotational motion, spin state evolution is investigated along with spin axis precession and resonance variation, and the Cassini states. The evolution of planetary orbits is also studied. The subjects considered are related to tides, secular resonances, disk dynamics, and disk-satellite interactions...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analytic}} model for transit timing variations produced by orbital conjunctions between gravitationally interacting planets. If the planetary orbits have tight <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing,</b> {{which is a}} common case among the Kepler planets, {{the effect of a}} single conjunction can be best described as: (1) a step-like change of the transit timing ephemeris with subsequent transits of the inner planet being delayed and those of the outer planet being sped up, and (2) a discrete change in sampling of the underlying oscillations from eccentricity-related interaction terms. In the limit of small orbital eccentricities, our analytic model gives explicit equations for these effects {{as a function of the}} mass and orbital separation of planets. We point out that a detection of the conjunction effect in real data is of crucial importance for the physical characterization of planetary systems from transit timing variations.

40|$|Mean orbital {{distances}} of planets from the Sun and of major satellites from the parent planets Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus are {{described by the}} square law 	, where the values of are consecutive integers, and is the mean orbital distance expected at for a particular system. Terrestrial planets and Jovian planets are analysed as separate sys-tems. Thus, five independent solar-like systems are considered. The basic assumption is that specific orbital angular momentum is ”quantized”. Consequently, all orbital parame-ters are also discrete. The number relates {{to the law of}} <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing.</b> An additional discretization, related to, i. e. to the scale of orbits, accounts for the detailed structure of planar gravitational systems. Consequently, it is also found that orbital velocity multi-plied by is equal to the multiple of a fundamental velocity km s, valid for all subsystems in the Solar System. This velocity is equal to one of the “velocity ” increments of quantized redshifts of galaxies...|$|E
40|$|An {{electron}} spin qubit in a silicon donor atom is a promising candidate for quantum information processing {{because of its}} long coherence time. To be sensed with a single-electron transistor, the donor atom is usually located near an interface, where the donor states can be coupled with interface states. Here we study the spin relaxation mechanisms arising from the coupling of a donor to confined interface states. We find that both Zeeman interaction and spin-orbit interaction can hybridize spin and orbital states, each contributing to phonon-assisted spin relaxation {{in addition to the}} spin relaxation for a bulk donor or a quantum dot. When the applied magnetic field $B$ is weak (compare to <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing),</b> the spin relaxation due to Zeeman interaction and spin-orbit interaction show the same $B^ 5 $ dependence on the magnitude of $B$ field, but show different angular dependencies on the orientation of $B$ field. We find that there are peaks (hot-spots) in the $B$-dependent and detuning dependent spin relaxation due to strong hybridization of orbital states with opposite spin. We also find spin relaxation dips (cool-spots) due to the interference of different relaxation paths. The electrically tunable spin relaxation hot-spots and cool-spots can be useful for fast spin initialization and the preservation of quantum information during the transfer of spin qubit...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} orbital {{architecture}} of multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler transit mission using N-body simulations, {{focusing on the}} <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing</b> between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting planets. We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12 mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability {{for as long as}} a billion years is, ~ 10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar, and ~ 12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities ~ 0. 02 (a value suggested by studies of planet transit-time-variations). This apparent coincidence, between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most, except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and larger spacings. So while the high multiple systems (five or more transiting planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the descendants of more closely packed high multiple systems. If this hypothesis is correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be {{different from that of the}} terrestrial planets. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaSatellites {{located at}} {{synchronous}} orbital altitudes are a resource {{vital to the}} support of military operations. These satellites must be protected from radio frequency interference with their communications and from physical damage that could occur in space. Collateral damage to a synchronous satellite is possible, {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack on another satellite, when the spatial separation distance required between satellites is not maintained. Physical damage to a synchronous satellite can also result from collision with another satellite, active or inactive, or collision with space debris objects, some too small to be under surveillance by ground tracking systems. While only a few collision and collision-potential incidents have occurred, the growing number of satellites and objects being placed in synchronous orbit increases the likelihood of problems arising in the future. This paper examines these threats to satellite integrity and operation and the analysis which has been accomplished on ways to protect against them. Satellite Position Management requirements are outlined and problems associated with managing satellite orbital positions are discussed. The Air Force recognizes the need to protect its space resources and is establishing guidelines and responsibilities for offices involved in the management of geosynchronous orbital altitude satellites. The actions being taken by the Air Force and other agencies to regulate satellite spacing and to reduce space debris are enumerated. The paper concludes that full protection will only be realized when DoD combines efforts with NASA and with foreign countries to develop international agreement on satellite <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing</b> and space debris control policies...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dynamical}} {{configuration of}} planets in binary star systems may not reflect their formation process since the binary orbit {{may have changed}} in the past after the planet formation process was completed. An observed binary system may {{have been part of}} a former hierarchical triple that became unstable after the planets completed their growth around the primary star. Alternatively, in a dense stellar environment even a single stellar encounter between the star pair and a singleton may singificantly alter the binary orbit. In both cases the planets we observe at present would have formed when the dynamical environment was different from the presently observed one. We have numerically integrated the trajectories of the stars (binary plus singleton) and of test planets to investigate the abovementioned mechanisms. Our simulations show that the circumstellar environment during planetary formation around the primary was gravitationally less perturbed when the binary was part of a hierarchical triple because the binary was necessarely wider and, possibly, less eccentric. This circumstance has consequences for the planetary system in terms of <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing,</b> eccentricity, and mass of the individual planets. Even {{in the case of a}} single stellar encounter the present appearance of a planetary system in a binary may significantly differ from what it had while planet formation was ongoing. However, while in the case of instability of a triple the trend is always towards a tighter and more eccentric binary system, when a single stellar encounter affects the system the orbit of the binary can become wider and be circularized.

40|$|The {{migration}} and encounter {{histories of the}} giant planets in our Solar System can be constrained by the obliquities of Jupiter and Saturn. We have performed secular simulations with imposed {{migration and}} N-body simulations with planetesimals to study the expected obliquity distribution of migrating planets with initial conditions resembling those of the smooth migration model, the resonant Nice model and two models with five giant planets initially in resonance (one compact and one loose configuration). For smooth migration, the secular spin-orbit resonance mechanism can tilt Saturn's spin axis to the current obliquity if {{the product of the}} migration time scale and the orbital inclinations is sufficiently large (exceeding 30 Myr deg). For the resonant Nice model with imposed migration, it is difficult to reproduce today's obliquity values, because the compactness of the initial system raises the frequency that tilts Saturn above the spin precession frequency of Jupiter, causing a Jupiter spin-orbit resonance crossing. Migration time scales sufficiently long to tilt Saturn generally suffice to tilt Jupiter more than is observed. The full N-body simulations tell a somewhat different story, with Jupiter generally being tilted as often as Saturn, but on average having a higher obliquity. The main obstacle is the final <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing</b> of the giant planets, coupled with the tail of Neptune's migration. The resonant Nice case is barely able to simultaneously reproduce the {orbital and spin} properties of the giant planets, with a probability ~ 0. 15 %. The loose five planet model is unable to match all our constraints (probability < 0. 08 %). The compact five planet model has the highest chance of matching the orbital and obliquity constraints simultaneously (probability ~ 0. 3 %) ...|$|E

40|$|We perform {{three-dimensional}} N-body integrations of {{the final}} stages of terrestrial planet formation. We report the results of 10 sim-ulations beginning with 22 – 50 initial planetary embryos spanning the range 0. 5 – 1. 5 AU, each with an initial mass of 0. 04 – 0. 13 M'. Collisions are treated as inelastic mergers. We follow the evolution of each system for 2 £ 108 years at which time a few terrestrial type planets remain. On average, our simulations produced two planets larger than 0. 5 M ' in the terrestrial region (1 simulation with one m ‚ 0. 5 M ' planet, 8 simulations with two m ‚ 0. 5 M' planets, and 1 simulation with three m ‚ 0. 5 M ' planets). These Earth-like planets have eccentricities and <b>orbital</b> <b>spacing</b> consid-erably larger than the terrestrial planets of comparable mass (e. g., Earth and Venus). We also examine the angular momentum con-tributions of each collision to the final spin angular momentum of a planet, with an emphasis on the type of impact which is believed to have triggered the formation of the Earth’s Moon. There was an average of two impacts per simulation that contributed more angular momentum to a planet than is currently present in the Earth/Moon system. We determine the spin angular momentum states of the growing planets by summing the contributions from each collisional encounter. Our results show that the spin angular momentum states {{of the final}} planets are generally the result of contributions made by the last few large impacts. Our results sug-gest that the current angular momentum of the Earth/Moon sys-tem {{may be the result of}} more than one large impact rather than a single impact. Further, upon suffering their first collision, the plan-etary embryos in our simulations are spinning rapidly through-out the final accretion of the planets, suggesting the proto-Earth may have been rotating rapidly prior to the Moon-forming impac...|$|E
