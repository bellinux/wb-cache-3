This experiment used changes in physical and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> to predict it's ripening rate. Moisture content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by using desiccation method and ripening stage <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by peel colour. Glucose (HK) Assay Kit was used to analyze glucose content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> and protein content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was analyzed by using Bradford reagent. These techniques were shown {{to be an effective}} way of analyzing unknown chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> fruits. The results of applying oxygen absorber in banana packaging were unexpected, lowering oxygen level alone in banana packaging promote ripening instead of delaying. Applying moisture absorber in banana packaging supported my hypothesis that reducing relative humidity of packaging environment can speed up ripening process. However, moisture absorber is not able to absorb excess water droplet cause by sweeting of fruit. The results showed that moisture absorber and oxygen absorber were not suitable to be used in either promoting or delaying ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> because active packaging cannot solve sweating problem leading to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> fruits. ...|$|R
40|$|Crown rot <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> {{caused by}} a fungal {{parasitic}} complex, {{is one of the}} main quality defects <b>of</b> exported <b>bananas.</b> Major variations in the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> to crown rot have been observed in different production zones. The physiological state <b>of</b> the <b>banana</b> fruit at harvest is said to influence its response to pathogenic attack and thus to modulate its susceptibility to crown rot. The susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> to this disease, however, appears to be influenced by many pre-harvest factors, although the underlying defense mechanisms have not been clearly identified. A recent report based on molecular analyses suggests that phenolic compounds might be involved in the different variations in the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> to crown rot.

30|$|The {{proposed}} technique bears {{at least}} three advantages. First, it leverages a training process to extract automatically multi-scale image features combining both the global and local features <b>of</b> the <b>banana</b> image.

Second, as the samples <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> with imperfections are also included in the experiments, the experimental results also validate that our method can be applied to fine-grained classification <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> at different ripening stages no matter the banana peel bears defects or not. Third, different from some existing methods [32], our indicator does not combine any information from the physiochemical or biological changes during the ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana.</b> However, it is still able to achieve competitive classification accuracy as validated by our experiments.|$|R

With increasing banana content, proximate composition, sweetness, and acidity <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> gruel increased, and pH showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 05). Saccharified banana gruel prepared with 15 ～ 45 % banana showed significantly lower viscosity.
