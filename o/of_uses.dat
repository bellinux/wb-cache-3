And there is no list featuring possibilities <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> From the wording of § 31 I 1 UrhG (“…einzelne oder alle…“, which means: “several or all”) it can be inferred that each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> shows distinctive characteristics.A type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> must, thus, be clearly distinguishable from any other type <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> [...] For each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> there is consequently a corresponding right <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> If there are several types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in connection with their work, there will be, in proportion, various rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> the author can grant. The types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> have changed and evolved {{in the course of}} technical development and they still continue to do so.The term “kind of use” refers to [...] "all technically and economically concretised utilisation of an author's work, meaning that the parties to a contract have specified the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the work as required for achieving the contractual purpose.The kinds <b>of</b> <b>use</b> listed in § 15 UrhG can be subdivided into several rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> which again can be matched, each, with a corresponding type <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> so it is always possible to restrict a right <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in many different ways as long as the specification <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> work makes clear the individuality of the type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> with respect to its economic and technical content.

They have a variety <b>of</b> <b>uses.</b> In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as}} a rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number <b>of</b> <b>uses.</b> The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E
5|$|The Norman Cob or Cob Normand is a {{breed of}} light draft horse that {{originated}} {{in the province of}} Normandy in northern France.

They are popular for recreational and competitive driving, representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several riding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in SaGa games {{is to increase}} character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: shields, helmets, breastplates, gauntlets, and shoes. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, {{and can be used}} only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number <b>of</b> <b>uses,</b> and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period, when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium, now Caernarfon. The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales, including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda, the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis, the Nantlle Valley quarries, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, where the slate was mined rather than quarried. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} software plasticity, i. e. {{the ability}} of interactive systems to adapt to context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> while preserving user-centered properties. In plasticity, a classical approach consists in concentrating design efforts {{on a set of}} pre-defined contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> that deserve high quality User Interfaces (UIs), and switching from one to another according to variations <b>of</b> context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> at runtime. However, key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> cannot be finely envisioned at design time, especially when dealing with the specific field of mobility. Thus, we propose a designer’s partner tool running on the end-user’s mobile device to probe key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the wild. The underlying principles are data gathering, bayesian learning, and clustering techniques. Probing key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> can save design efforts...|$|R

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break after a number <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the primary}} portion of Infinity Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E
