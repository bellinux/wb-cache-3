5|$|In the morning, {{attention}} focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> Saigon, where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested {{in front of}} the Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood by. The crowd and a government official equipped with a loudspeaker exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among the crowd and attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors.|$|E

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 8 July, the French had still failed to {{concentrate}} their forces, which consisted of 576 regular French Army soldiers and 2,717 militia dispersed across the island. Seeing that a landing {{on the beach at}} Grande Chaloupe was still practical, Captains Rowley and Lambert successfully landed their contingents, providing Keating with sufficient force to march on Saint Denis. While Keating was landing, Frazier had advanced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> from the west, storming a French barricade on the road from Saint Paul and routing its defenders with minimal casualties. Brushing aside French resistance in a series of minor skirmishes, Keating and Frazier's forces closed on Saint Denis. The advancing British were met at 18:00 by representatives of Sainte-Suzanne, who later signed a capitulation that surrendered the entire island to Rowley, Keating and Farquhar with its garrison and supplies.|$|E

5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions to operate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held {{a monopoly on}} these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin {{to be with}} Hitler at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} leave as the Red Army closed in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital.</b> After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her marriage certificate she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it with Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out. It gave Hugh Dowding AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Fighter Command, the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces. The British, possibly {{through the use of}} Ultra intelligence, recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital.</b> ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, {{it would not have been}} difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E

5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface of American life in the Depression was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E
5|$|The Siliwangi Division, {{originally}} {{headquartered in}} West Java, is temporarily based in Central Java {{owing to the}} Renville Agreement. After putting down a communist rebellion in Madiun, killing numerous members of the Communist Party of Indonesia in the process, {{they are on a}} break. The division's leader, Captain Sudarto, meets with an Indo woman named Connie, who is originally from Bandung. The two become friendly, but after a Dutch attack is launched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> at Yogyakarta, they must separate as the division heads westwards. Captain Sudarto leads his men– together with women and children– over more than , resting during the day and travelling in the morning and evening.

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} three years Sudirman saw negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial forces fail, first after the Linggadjati Agreement– which Sudirman participated in drafting– and then the Renville Agreement; he was also faced with internal dissent, including a 1948 coup d'état attempt. He later blamed these issues for his tuberculosis, which led to his right lung being collapsed in November 1948. On 19 December 1948, several days after Sudirman's release from the hospital, the Dutch launched an assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital.</b> Sudirman and a small contingent escaped Dutch forces and left the city, making their headquarters at Sobo, near Mount Lawu. There Sudirman commanded military activities throughout Java, including {{a show of force}} in Yogyakarta on 1 March 1949. When the Dutch began withdrawing, in July 1949 Sudirman was recalled to Yogyakarta and forbidden to fight further. In late 1949 Sudirman's tuberculosis relapsed, and he retired to Magelang, where he died slightly more than a month after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence. He is buried at Semaki Heroes' Cemetery in Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|France {{controlled}} {{a number}} of trading harbours along the Indian coast including Mahé and Chandernagore, all governed from the larger port of Pondicherry. However, the strongest French position in the region was the isolated island of Île de France, later known as Mauritius, with its subordinate bases of Réunion and small settlements on Madagascar in the Seychelles and on Rodrigues. Île de France, centred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> Port Louis, had important commercial agricultural features and an economy dominated by African slave labour. The islands were only commercially viable when left ungarrisoned, and if any troops had to be supported or the islands came under blockade there were corresponding economic difficulties and food shortages. The island was most valuable as a naval base, situated in an ideal position for raiders to intercept British trade between Europe and the East Indies. The upheavals of the French Revolution had reached Île de France, with accusations against senior officials leading to arrests in 1792. The arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery in August 1794 almost plunged the island into civil war, and only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented conflict.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, Marston {{sides with}} Mexican Army Colonel Agustín Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) and his {{right-hand}} man Captain Vincente de Santa (Hector Luis Bustamante), to help end a rebellion {{in return for}} Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays Marston, who then sides with the rebels. With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts (Ross Hagen), Marston, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes (Josh Segarra) {{and one of his}} lovers Luisa (Francesca Galeas), eventually turns the tide in favour of the rebels, killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. Marston is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. Marston and Reyes then take the fight to Allende, where Luisa is killed during the attack. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee, but are apprehended and executed. Reyes then takes charge of the local government and plans to advance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital,</b> while Marston leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.|$|E
5|$|In September 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 {{led by the}} Kraeng of Galesong {{crossed over}} from Madura to Java and later took Surabaya, the {{principal}} city of eastern Java. Mataram sent a large force, commanded by the crown prince (later Amangkurat II) to meet the rebels. A battle took place in Gegodog, east of Tuban, in 1676, resulting in the complete defeat of the much larger Mataram forces. The loyalist army was routed, the king's uncle Pangeran Purbaya was killed, and the crown prince fled to Mataram. The crown prince was blamed for this defeat due to his long wavering before attacking the rebels. In addition, there were rumours that he colluded with the enemy, which included his former protégé Trunajaya. In the {{few months after the}} victory in Gegodog, the rebels quickly took Javanese northern trading towns from Surabaya westward to Cirebon, including the towns of Kudus and Demak. The towns fell easily, partly because their fortifications had been destroyed due to their conquest by Sultan Agung about 50 years earlier. Only Jepara managed to resist capture, due to combined efforts of the new military governor and VOC forces who reinforced the town just in time. The rebellion spread inland when Raden Kajoran, Trunajaya's powerful father-in-law based to the east of the Mataram capital, joined the rebellion. Kajoran and Trunajaya's forces marched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital,</b> but were repelled by loyalist forces.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E
