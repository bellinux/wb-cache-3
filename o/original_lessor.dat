50|$|The {{impact of}} huur gaat voor koop in modern South African law {{is that the}} {{purchaser}} (the new owner) is substituted ex lege for the <b>original</b> <b>lessor,</b> and the latter falls out of the picture. On being so substituted, the new owner acquires, by operation of law, all {{the rights of the}} <b>original</b> <b>lessor</b> under the lease.|$|E
50|$|This {{position}} is accepted by {{proponents of the}} universal-or-particular-successors distinction, {{as it has been}} agreed that the doctrine applies not only to purchasers of leased property, but also to gratuitous successors in title of the <b>original</b> <b>lessor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{sublessor}} remains {{liable to}} the <b>original</b> <b>lessor</b> {{in accordance with}} the initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other original lease terms. In a down-market, the original lessee may require a lower rent payment from the sublessee than what he or she may have originally paid, leaving the remaining rent owed to the lessor to be paid by the original lessee. However, if market prices have increased since the original lease was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the <b>original</b> <b>lessor.</b> However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.|$|E
50|$|The lessee, in turn, is also {{bound by}} the lease. Provided that the new owner {{recognises}} his rights, the lessee {{does not have any}} option, or right of election, to resile from the contract on the alienation of the leased property by the <b>original</b> <b>lessor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thus, if the lessee elects not {{to abide}} by the lease, no damages may be {{recovered}} by him if the lessor is prepared to allow the tenancy to continue. The Appellate Division has adopted the approach of an automatic transfer of rights and obligations from the <b>original</b> <b>lessor</b> to the purchaser.|$|E
