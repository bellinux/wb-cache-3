Sometime later, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque on the stone, but it was absent {{at the time of its}} nomination in 1982. The marker is currently mortared into a retaining wall at the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> on 640 South Main Street at the intersection and has been since prior to 1982.

2500|$|It is 1980, and chalk artist Sonny Malone is {{dissatisfied}} with his sidewalk mural of the Greek Muses (daughters of Zeus) and determines to kill himself.

Zeus's rules require that Muses must always be disguised from mortals. Clio has the idea to wear roller skates, leg warmers, and sport an Australian accent, and the other muses agree. Clio changes her name to something contemporary: [...] "Kira".

40|$|The {{research}} {{addresses the}} questioning {{about how the}} spatial configuration and <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> influence <b>the</b> decision system in <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> pedestrians. <b>The</b> possible {{answer to the question}} stems from the hypothesis that there is an interrelation between <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course and the facilities offered for locomotions, i. e., if, in their movements, the pedestrians prioritize, in addition to saving on routes, sidewalks that offer better moving conditions, {{it would be possible to}} indicate and describe the most important factors that determine this movements. In methodological terms, through complementary focuses, what is discussed are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main factors linked to sidewalks which intervene in <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> pedestrians, namely: <b>the</b> configura-tional focus related to the Space Syntax method (Hillier & Hanson, 1984), i. e., <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban street network as an inductor of pedestrian movements; and a focus on <b>the</b> usable conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> linked to <b>the</b> Level-of-Service (KHISTY, 1994), i. e., it detects why the movements occur and where the movements and locomotions of pedestrians are spatially located. <b>The</b> cross-ing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Space Syntax and Level-of-Service techniques makes it possible for both <b>the</b> constituent parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> <b>sidewalks</b> and <b>the</b> series <b>of</b> elements involved in <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> pedest...|$|R
50|$|Car-oriented urban {{planning}} {{became even more}} extreme since the 1980s, pedestrians seeing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's popular streets being converted into car-parking spots.

There are plans to convert both ends of Taşköprü to squares and widen <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> in <b>the</b> old town where {{it is difficult to}} walk at <b>the</b> peddler-invaded narrow <b>sidewalks.</b> By far <b>the</b> most pedestrian friendly street <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city is Turgut Özal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in Çukurova district are also very convenient for walking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Disability, as a {{biological}} and social phenomenon, {{is a fact}} to be faced by all <b>the</b> societies regardless <b>of</b> their level of development; and their number is increasing every year as well. Due to a lot <b>of</b> issues like <b>the</b> war and <b>the</b> large numbers <b>of</b> handicapped and veterans in Iran, this has been considered so much. Therefore, developing the proper spatial and physical infrastructures is of particular importance. Today, so much physical deficiencies in cities have reduced <b>the</b> useful application <b>of</b> urban public spaces to minimum for the citizens {{and in many cases}} almost inconceivable to use. Meanwhile, we should note that among <b>the</b> urban spaces, <b>sidewalks</b> and walkways have specific importance, for <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> is not only a passing way, but <b>the</b> major part <b>of</b> urban street network.
