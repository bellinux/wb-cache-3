40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a price signal with two settings: <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> and on-peak tariff. Some loads {{are connected to}} specific electricity meters which allow the consumption of power only in off-peak periods. Historically, off-peak periods were located during the night and on-peak periods during the day. Changing the assignment of off-peak periods is an easy method for distribution system operators to access to the flexibility of small consumers. This solution can be implemented quickly as the infrastructure needed already exists in some countries. We propose a mixed-integer linear model to assign optimally the off-peak hours so as to minimize a societal cost. This cost gathers together the cost of electricity, the financial losses due to energy curtailments of photovoltaic installations and the loads’ wellbeing. Our model considers automatic tripping of inverters and constraints of the electrical distribution networks. Simulation {{results show that the}} new disposition of off-peak hours could reduce significantly the photovoltaic energy curtailed in the summer.

40|$|The {{industrial}} sector {{is the second}} largest consumer of energy in Malaysia. In this energy audit, the most important parameters that have been collected are as follows: power rating and operation time of energy-consuming equipments/machineries; fossil fuel and other sources of energy use; production figure; peak and <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> usage behavior and power factor. These data were then analyzed to investigate the breakdown of end-use equipments/machineries energy use, the peak and off-peak usage behavior, power factor trend and specific energy use. The results of the energy audit showed that the highest electrical energy-using equipment was an electric motor followed by pumps and air compressors. The specific energy use has been estimated and compared with four Indonesian industries and {{it was found that}} three Malaysian industries were more efficient than the Indonesian counterpart. The study also found that about 64 electrical energy was used in peak hours by the industries and the average power factor ranged from 0. 88 to 0. 92.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} reactive power support of single-phase electric vehicle chargers, during charging, in a low-voltage residential distribution grid. For a representative Flemish case study, reactive power support is investigated for three different electric vehicle charging strategies: uncoordinated charging, residential <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> charging, and vehicle-based peak shaving. For an increasing electric vehicle penetration rate and an increasing amount of reactive power injection, {{the impact on the}} residential voltage deviations, peak load, and grid losses is calculated. The results of the case study show that the implementation of a capacitive load behavior in electric vehicle chargers has a beneficial impact on the voltage deviations. Furthermore, for a capacitive power factor of 0. 95 or higher, there is no disadvantage with respect to the residential peak load and the residential grid losses. However, the cost related to the increased apparent power rating of the vehicle chargers, required to supply the reactive power, should be assessed compared to the mentioned advantages. If the benefits outweigh the costs, reactive power support could be considered in the grid compliance requirements of electric vehicle chargers, as it allows deferring distribution grid infrastructure investments. status: publishe...|$|E

It was also found that by utilizing the thermal mass of a concrete floor slab or by integrating external insulation, acceptable comfort levels during the heating season were maintained when operating the ASHP solely during <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> periods. A thinner concrete floor slab containing phase change material (PCM) provided a slightly improved comfort level during winter and also reduced overheating during summer in buildings {{with a high level of}} insulation.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} are {{growing at a}} significant rate {{in the world and}} that makes it essential for modern day electricity networks to be prepared for their integration. A common approach of preparing the network for any kind of demand {{is to be able to}} predict or estimate the same based on data and simulations using optimization techniques. This work was aimed at the same in two distinct parts. In the first part, game theoretic methods were tried to be applied to an existing multi agent probabilistic model estimating net demand from electric vehicle. Owing to the complexity of the undertaking, it was decided to only include a payoff based allocation of electric vehicle charging scenarios to estimate electric vehicle demand which accounted for all scenarios rather than all vehicles charging in a single scenario. In the second part, a smaller scenario of an affluent household with two electric vehicles and typical mobility pattern was formulated. Game theory solution concept of Nash Equilibrium was used to optimize the charging of both electric vehicles over a week of usage. The results from the first part, displayed an overall reduction in maximum loads while there were certain shifts in loads observed as well. As an exercise without any inherent optimization mechanism the overall results from this segment were inconclusive. The results from the second part, demonstrated needs for charging the EVs shifting to offpeak hours and charging of vehicles, a maximum of 1 - 2 times per week based on user range anxiety, game theoretic competition and mobility needs. Further, savings from charging at <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariffs</b> based on time of use electricity tariffs were also evaluated...|$|R
25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, <b>off-peak</b> electricity <b>tariff</b> such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|R
40|$|Provision {{of network}} {{infrastructure}} to meet rising network peak demand is increasing {{the cost of}} electricity. Addressing this demand is a major imperative for Australian electricity agencies. The network peak demand model reported in this paper provides a quantified decision support tool and a means of understanding the key influences and impacts on network peak demand. An investigation of the system factors impacting residential consumers' peak demand for electricity was undertaken in Queensland, Australia. Technical factors, such as the customers' location, housing construction and appliances, were combined with social factors, such as household demographics, culture, trust and knowledge, and Change Management Options (CMOs) such as tariffs, price, managed supply, etc., in a conceptual 'map' of the system. A Bayesian network was used to quantify the model and provide insights into the major influential factors and their interactions. The model was also {{used to examine the}} reduction in network peak demand with different market-based and government interventions in various customer locations of interest and investigate the relative importance of instituting programs that build trust and knowledge through well designed customer-industry engagement activities. The Bayesian network was implemented via a spreadsheet with a tickbox interface. The model combined available data from industry-specific and public sources with relevant expert opinion. The results revealed that the most effective intervention strategies involve combining particular CMOs with associated education and engagement activities. The model demonstrated the importance of designing interventions that take into account the interactions of the various elements of the socio-technical system. The options that provided the greatest impact on peak demand were <b>Off-Peak</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and Managed Supply and increases in the price of electricity. The impact in peak demand reduction differed for each of the locations and highlighted that household numbers, demographics as well as the different climates were significant factors. It presented possible network peak demand reductions which would delay any upgrade of networks, resulting in savings for Queensland utilities and ultimately for households. The use of this systems approach using Bayesian networks to assist the management of peak demand in different modelled locations in Queensland provided insights about the most important elements in the system and the intervention strategies that could be tailored to the targeted customer segments...|$|R
40|$|Today {{with the}} {{developments}} of technology, expansion and developments in industries and {{increase in the}} standard of living of the society, the demand for electricity keeps rising every day. It {{is the responsibility of the}} utility to increase its supply to meet this demand in order maintain the demand supply balance. It is not always economical to meet this increasing demand by building new power plants. Hence today, more interest is shown towards controlling the demand, through Demand Side Management (DSM). In this thesis, several customer categories were first studied in order to identify the potential DSM options that can be implemented. The selected option was Thermal Energy Storage in buildings, by constructing storage tanks to store chilled water during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> period, and using the stored chilled water to meet the peak-time cooling demand. The technical potential for savings that can be obtained through applying this technology in Sri Lankan context is analyzed, and the potential saving that can be achieved in the General Purpose and Hotel category customer group is calculated. DSM projects should ideally be a win-win option to the economy, the utility and the customer. The potential benefits of thermal energy storage, to the three parties expected to benefit are separately analyzed in this study. The results of the thesis is that Chilled Water Storage technology is a viable DSM project in Sri Lanka. It is the responsibility of the Utility to actively market it to its customer base and motivate them to participate in the project. This also requires the utility intervention to make this project more attractive to its customers through providing part of the investment cost.

40|$|In recent decades, {{around the}} world, {{a huge amount}} of daytime peak power has been shifted to the {{off-peak}} hours by using different types of thermal energy storage systems. However, the contribution of these systems in Malaysia is still minor in comparison with their potential. Therefore, the feasibility and potentiality of employing ice thermal storage (ITS) systems for office building cooling applications is studied to investigate their economical and environmental benefits. The air conditioning systems in Malaysia are considered as the major energy consumers in office buildings with around 57 share. The economical analysis of the cost benefits is carried out for a system including chiller and storage system. The installation costs are mainly dominated by the total system capacity; hence the study was conducted for a range of 100 - 2000 tons of refrigeration (TR) (352 - 7034 kW) for two storage strategy of full storage and load levelling storage strategy. The results indicate that considering the special <b>off-peak</b> <b>tariff</b> rate of 0. 06 /kWh for the total system capacities of 500 and 1500 TR (1758 kW and 5275 kW), the annual cost saving varies from 230, 000 to 700, 000 and from 65, 000 to 190, 000 for full storage and load levelling storage strategy, respectively. The overall results show that the full storage strategy can reduce the annual costs of the air conditioning system by up to 35 while this reduction is limited to around 8 for a load levelling strategy. The comparison study reveals that for the full storage strategy the payback period varies between 3 and 6 years while the payback period for the load levelling strategy varies between 1 and 3 years. It was concluded that the ITS system can {{play a vital role in}} consuming the natural resources in a more efficient, economical and environmentally benign way by changing the electricity consumption pattern to overcome the disparity between energy generation and energy demand...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for the optimization {{of the daily}} operations of a pumping plant has been developed. Two major issues have been investigated in relation to pump operations; maximizing pumping during <b>off-peak</b> electricity <b>tariff</b> periods and minimizing the head against which water is pumped. The new approach {{presented in this paper}} incorporates the combination of both a pump schedule and trigger levels to control the system. Different trigger levels are used during different periods of the day, such that peak pumping and pumping head are minimized. Additionally, scheduling is used to maximize pumping in the off-peak period thereby ensuring that the maximum amount of water is available in elevated storage facilities at the start of peak tariff periods. A genetic algorithm that incorporates realvalue and integer decision variables has been developed to determine the best combinations of trigger levels and scheduling for a predicted demand flow for the next day. The methodology has been applied to the Murray Bridge Water Treatment plant in South Australia. The current operating controls based on fixed trigger levels in the upper tank at this plant have been compared with the new combined scheduling/trigger levels operating controls approach. Very promising results have been obtained, with a 20 % saving predicted on energy costs during low and moderate demands. Michael D. Kazantzis, Angus R. Simpson, David Kwong, and Shyh Min Ta...|$|R
40|$|A {{predictive}} {{load shifting}} control {{system for a}} heat pump has been developed and installed in a low carbon test house located at the BRE Innovation Park, Motherwell, near Glasgow. The house features an exhaust-air source heat pump supplying an under floor heating system. The controller predicted the day-ahead space heating requirements for the house, based on forecast air temperatures and solar radiation levels and then automatically set the heat pump’s start and stop times for the following day. The heat pump’s operation was restricted where possible to <b>off-peak</b> electricity <b>tariff</b> periods (00 : 00 - 07 : 00). The controller’s operating parameters were pre-set using a calibrated building simulation model. After installation, the controller’s performance was monitored during September 2015 and analysis of test data showed that the predictive control maintained indoor air temperatures between 18 - 23 oC for around 87 % of notional occupied hours between 07 : 00 - 22 : 00; this was better than predicted by simulation. However, the energy performance of the heat pump was extremely poor as it did not function well under intermittent load-shifting operation, {{with the majority of}} the heat was delivered primarily by an auxiliary immersion coil rather than the heat pump itself.

30|$|As all {{components}} of the system have already been constructed and considered sufficient for {{the operation of the}} system, there are no design decisions to consider, only operating decisions. For this case study, operating decisions consist of trigger levels in the various storages. These types of decision variables are chosen considering the control system available at each pump station (based on storage levels and not on time of the day) {{and the fact that the}} controls have to be defined for an operational horizon of 1 year or longer. As all of the pump stations have two or more pumps arranged in parallel, having different trigger level values may have a large impact on the operating point of the pumps and consequently their energy consumption. It is also likely that different trigger levels will be chosen for peak and <b>off-peak</b> electricity <b>tariff</b> periods when they are included in a cost optimization. For this system a peak/off-peak electricity tariff applies on weekdays, with weekends priced at the off-peak rate. A peak monthly electrical energy demand charge also applies to the Macquarie River pipeline pumping system. In order to assess the performance of different tank trigger levels, the infrastructure to be modeled includes the natural and urban catchments for the surface water and stormwater systems respectively, Suma Park reservoir, pipelines and pumps in the groundwater, Macquarie River and stormwater systems, and wetlands and storage ponds in the stormwater systems.|$|R
40|$|Peak {{electricity}} demand poses a particular challenge both to network operators and to energy suppliers. A reduction in peak demand would allow existing networks to accommodate load growth with lower investment, and {{also reduce the}} cost of electricity generation during peak periods. To explore the potential for peak reduction, the Customer-Led Network Revolution project has trialled a Time of Use (ToU) tariff scheme. By increasing electricity prices during the weekday peak period (4 pm- 8 pm) for throughout the year and reducing prices in <b>off-peak</b> periods, the <b>tariff</b> incentivises a shift in consumption out of the peak period. A static ToU tariff was used – that is, the tariff remained constant and did not change dynamically depending on expected network loading. Based on smart meter data and survey responses, test cell (TC) 9 a investigated the electricity use patterns of 574 domestic users on a ToU tariff between October 2012 and September 2013 and compared them to those of the control group (test cell 1 a). The impact of demographic profile on customers’ responses to the ToU tariff was also considered. On average, when compared to consumers in the control cell TC 1 a, customers on the ToU tariff had lower consumption during the peak period on weekdays, and higher consumption at other times – indicating that the tariff achieved the intended behaviour change.
