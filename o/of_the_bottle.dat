5|$|In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn {{formed a}} country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bottle</b> Rockets). Henneman {{impressed}} Uncle Tupelo, {{and he was}} invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.|$|E
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle {{in combination with other}} point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|With {{contamination}} of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having {{been the source of}} the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> sealed with foil and the lid secured to the bottle with plastic wrap.|$|E
50|$|Cojocaru {{confessed to}} {{throwing}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles,</b> and to having provided fuel, a lighter and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass <b>bottles.</b> However, {{he claimed that}} {{he had no idea what}} the group was up to.|$|R
500|$|After packaging, <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> {{were stored}} {{from three to}} five weeks at [...] {{in a dark room}} as the yeast {{continued}} to ferment the remaining sugars in the beer. [...] The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of carbonation. [...] During this period, an average of four to five percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> would burst due to carbonation levels exceeding <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2016 to analyze <b>the</b> bacteriological quality <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> {{drinking water and}} that of municipal tap water in Dharan found, that one hundred percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tap water samples and 87.5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water samples to be contaminated with heterotrophic bacteria. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> tap water samples, 55.3% were positive for total coliforms, compared with 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water, but no bottled water samples were positive for fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, in contrast to 21.1% and 14.5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tap water samples being contaminated with fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, respectively. One hundred percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tap water samples and 54.2% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water samples had pH in the acceptable range.|$|R
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{spilling}} or spraying any Champagne, open the Champagne bottle by holding the cork and rotating the bottle at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> at speed. Also, holding the bottle at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E

25|$|Made {{famous by}} the {{champagne}} used to christen large ships at launch, sparkling white wine {{is produced in}} almost all wine-producing countries {{and has become a}} benchmark for providing a festive and commemorative spirit to an event. This unique side is found in the labelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Firstly the gas pressure requires a heavier bottle, then the plug with its mushroom shape must be retained by a Muselet, and finally the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> is covered with a metallic foil shell gold or silver coloured.|$|E
25|$|Another {{variation}} {{is within the}} disposal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Some witch's bottles were thrown into a fire and when they exploded, the spell was broken or the witch supposedly killed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} who sell their own products {{directly to the}} consumer, explain these natural phenomena to the customer who then serve the wine gently {{in order to prevent}} the crystals forming in the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Escola was a {{waitress}} in a restaurant. She was putting away glass bottles of Coca-Cola when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> spontaneously exploded in her hand. She successfully {{argued that the}} company was liable.|$|R

25|$|Because COT is {{unstable}} and easily forms explosive organic peroxides, {{a small amount}} of hydroquinone is usually added to commercially available material. Testing for peroxides is advised when using a previously opened bottle; white crystals around the neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> may be composed of the peroxide, which may explode when mechanically disturbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of off-flavours in the cork used to bottle a wine during prolonged aging can {{be detrimental to}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> The formation of cork taint is a complex process which may result {{from a wide range}} of factors ranging from the growing conditions of the cork oak, the processing of the cork into stoppers, or the molds growing on the cork itself.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{preservation}} of perfumes involves keeping {{them away from}} sources of heat and storing them where {{they will not be}} exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, {{as long as it is}} well stored. However the presence of oxygen in the head space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.|$|E
50|$|A {{novel use}} is as a {{building}} material in third-world countries. According to online sources, <b>the</b> <b>bottles,</b> in a labor-intensive process, {{are filled with}} sand, then stacked and either mudded or cemented {{together to form a}} wall. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> can be filled instead with air or water, to admit light into the structure.|$|R
40|$|Bottled {{water is}} clean water ready to drink quickly without cooking however, {{it is not}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water have a good quality. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> water can be {{observed}} from <b>the</b> optical properties <b>of</b> water, such as clarity and refractive index. A study {{has been carried out}} by using interferometer Murty method to know the relation between turbidity and refractive index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water. <b>The</b> refractive index measurement was carried out for 20 samples from 10 brands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottled</b> water. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> refractive index measurement shows that <b>the</b> refractive index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water is about 1, 1, in averge on the other hand <b>the</b> refractive index <b>of</b> water based on literature is 1, 33. Along with the refractive index measurement by using interferometer Murty, turbidity was also measured by using Turbidimeter. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> measurement show that there is a relation between turbidity and refractive index. <b>The</b> deviation <b>of</b> refractive index values obtained in this measurement from the literature data is because there are some error in the measurement process. By improving the error, better measurement will allow the interferometer Murty to be used to inspect water clarity...|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} of Champagne and many sparkling wines requires a second fermentation {{to occur in}} the bottle in order to produce the carbonation necessary for the style. A small amount of sugared liquid is added to individual bottles, and the yeast is allowed to convert this to more alcohol and carbon dioxide. The lees are then ricked into the neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> frozen, and expelled via pressure of the carbonated wine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then {{inflated}} against a two-part mold to form {{them into the}} final shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> Preforms (uninflated bottles) are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some Red Cross chapters distribute {{them as part of}} the Vial of Life program to homeowners to store medical history for emergency responders. Another increasingly common use for the preforms are containers in the outdoor activity geocaching.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{peroxides}} can spontaneously precipitate as concentrated crystalline solids {{within a}} storage container for ether. When this solid is formed {{at the mouth}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle,</b> merely twisting the cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to detonate. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they are {{more of a problem}} in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle. Low-volume users should acquire only small amounts of peroxide-prone solvents, and dispose of old solvents on a regular periodic schedule.|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{rain water}} collector is disclosed {{to collect a}} plurality of successive rain water samples, comprised of a reservoir into which rain water is collected and discharged, and a motor-driven turntable which holds a plurality <b>of</b> sample <b>bottles.</b> When <b>the</b> reservoir is filled to a predetermined volume, means, such as a liquid level sensor, actuates a valve to open same and discharge the liquid sample from the reservoir into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> at a filling station on the turntable. The valve then closes and the turntable rotates to index <b>the</b> next <b>bottle</b> beneath <b>the</b> reservoir at the filling station, and the operation is repeated to fill <b>the</b> latter <b>bottle.</b> When all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottles</b> on <b>the</b> turntable have been filled, the indexing means is deactivated and liquid accumulating in the reservoir is diverted to an overflow bottle...|$|R

25|$|The exact {{formula of}} Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients, which are {{listed on the}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> or can) is a trade secret. The {{original}} copy of the formula was held in SunTrust Bank's main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the underwriter for the Coca-Cola Company's initial public offering in 1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which {{will be on display}} for visitors to its World of Coca-Cola museum in downtown Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of wine components are dissolved in the wine: certain components, however, may take an insoluble form during ageing or storage of wine – {{this is the}} case with tartaric acid. A salt containing potassium, potassium bitartrate {{is in the form of}} crystals at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> This is a natural phenomenon but many producers seek to avoid this as dealers and uninformed consumers take these crystals as a fault. It is caused or accelerated by cold storage: low temperature reduces its solubility. The habit of refreshing white wine makes this wine particularly sensitive to this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or the orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due {{to the risk of}} the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel {{on the floor of a}} wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
