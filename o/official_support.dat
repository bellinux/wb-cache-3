5|$|The Naval Academy's {{first ever}} {{football}} team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no <b>official</b> <b>support</b> from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by {{its members and}} their fellow students. This would continue until 1892, when that season's team was led by coach Ben Crosby. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, likely {{due to the lack of}} support.|$|E
5|$|According to Ellsworth P. Bertholf's biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. The Naval Academy's first ever football team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no <b>official</b> <b>support</b> from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by its members and their fellow students. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, apparently on the Academy superintendent's cow pasture. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, {{due to the lack of}} support from officials. When football returned to the academy in 1882, the squad was led by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and won 8–0 in a match with Johns Hopkins, starting a seven-year rivalry between the schools. The 1883 season resulted in Navy's first ever loss, a 2–0 defeat by Johns Hopkins. Navy returned the favor the following year, defeating Hopkins in a close 9–6 game.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks <b>official</b> <b>support</b> for online {{multiplayer}} play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E

5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, <b>official</b> <b>support</b> emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In England, Nicolls {{failed to}} obtain <b>{{official}}</b> <b>support</b> for the Creeks, and Josiah Francis failed to receive official recognition for his credentials as the Redstick Creek emissary from the Foreign Office, {{although he did}} receive recognition as a former Colonel of the British Army in Florida as well as publicized encounters with British notables, before returning to West Florida in 1816. Josiah Francis and another Seminole leader, Nehemathla Micco, were summarily executed by the Americans in Spanish territorial waters in April 1818. Nicolls himself was retained on full pay status in the duties of a captain and brevet major of the Royal Marines. While he was in America, he had the local rank of lieutenant colonel (by authority of Vice Admiral Cochrane) as he was commander of a battalion of the Corps of Colonial Marines. He was awarded a pension of £250 annually on 28 December 1815 {{for a total of}} 24 serious battle wounds suffered, and awarded a sword of honour by Britain's Patriotic Fund. He was made a brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 August 1819.|$|E

5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic relations with Israel and {{is said to have}} secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou Strip to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew <b>official</b> <b>support</b> to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and Australia, early {{memorials}} {{were closely}} linked to the need to promote military recruitment and the state had an ambivalent attitude towards the informal memorials that emerged during the conflict. In Britain, stone memorials to the war began to be erected in towns and villages from 1915 onwards; some of these were given out by the state as rewards to communities for meeting military recruitment targets. In Australia, the existing memorials to mark the Boer War were used initially for commemorative ceremonies intended to increase military recruitment. As casualties increased, rolls of honour listing the dead began to be displayed in Britain and honour tablets with the names of those who had enlisted were put up inside Australian buildings: Australia used these lists to apply moral pressure on those who were not yet joined up. Informal memorials began to multiply as the war progressed. Local Australian groups erected small monuments, such as drinking fountains and stone pillars, {{to the point where the}} government became concerned about the expenditure on them and passed a law in 1916 to control their numbers. In Britain, some Anglican church leaders began to create street war shrines to the dead. These cheap, local memorials were mainly constructed in working class districts, often built from wood and paper, and were used for holding short services in honour of the dead and to hold donations of flowers. They were criticised, however, as promoting Catholic ritualism. <b>Official</b> <b>support</b> for the shrines only came after a national newspaper campaign, efforts by the Lord Mayor of London and a well-publicised visit from Queen Mary to a shrine, and standardised stone shrines then began to replace the earlier, temporary versions.|$|E
