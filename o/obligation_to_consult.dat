25|$|After the {{creation}} of British North America, Canadians were entitled to receive British imperial honours, though the awarding of these was not consistently allowed. From Confederation until the Nickle Resolution in 1919, the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George served as the equivalent of today's Order of Canada, being the highest non-peerage honour available to Canadian politicians, judges, and civil servants. Appointments into the Order of the British Empire, into grades below those that carried a title, were also commonly made. Besides knighthoods, peerage titles (both hereditary and life) were also bestowed on Canadians, sometimes with uniquely Canadian designations—such as Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe and Baron Beaverbrook of Beaverbrook in the Province of New Brunswick and of Cherkley in the County of Surrey—and permitted those so honoured {{to sit in the}} House of Lords at Westminster. Such acts of recognition were carried out by the reigning British monarch. Prior to Confederation, the sovereign did so on the advice of the British prime minister, the names of those to be honoured either selected by the colonial governor or governor general in British North America and passed on to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and then the prime minister, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and passed on to the prime minister, or by the prime minister himself. The British government felt no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> any government in British North America before bestowing an honour upon any resident of the colonies. Following Confederation, the Prime Minister of Canada submitted a list of names to the monarch via the governor general, though the governor general also continued to recommend individuals for honours without the Canadian prime minister's knowledge.|$|E

40|$|This Article explores three {{theories}} of humanitarian intervention that appear in, or are inspired by, {{the writings of}} Hugo Grotius. One theory asserts that natural law authorizes all states to punish violations {{of the law of}} nations, irrespective of where or against whom the violations occur, to preserve the integrity of international law. A second theory, which also appears in Grotius’s writings, proposes that states may intervene as temporary legal guardians for peoples who have suffered intolerable cruelties at the hands of their own state. Each of these theories has fallen out of fashion today based on skepticism about their natural law underpinnings and concerns about how they have facilitated Western colonialism. As an alternative, this Article outlines a third theory that builds upon Grotius’s account of humanitarian intervention as a fiduciary relationship, while updating Grotius’s account for the twenty-first century. According to this new fiduciary theory, when states intervene to protect human rights abroad they exercise an oppressed people’s right of self-defense on their behalf and may use force solely for the people’s benefit. As fiduciaries, intervening states bear <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> with and honor the preferences of the people they seek to protect, and they must respect international human rights governing the use of force within the affected state. By clarifying the respective responsibilities of the Security Council and individual states for humanitarian intervention, the fiduciary theory also lends greater coherency to the international community’s “responsibility to protect” human rights...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{whether there}} is a legal duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> with Indigenous groups prior to the {{ratification}} of international trade and investment agreements. It considers both the content of the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> and the circumstances under which such a duty is triggered. In doing so, this paper analyzes the arguments of Hupacasth First Nation v Canada, the only case that has been brought to the courts on this issue. Although the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the Hupacasath First Nation’s claim that the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> extends <b>to</b> negotiations that the federal government enters into with other State governments for Foreign Investment Protection Agreements (FIPAs), the analysis was confined to the particulars of the case.

To conclude, this paper investigates other potential sources of the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> in law, including First Nations treaties, exemption clauses in Free Trade Agreements and FIPAs, and international <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> indigenous peoples...|$|R

40|$|As {{the duty}} <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> Aboriginal peoples becomes operationalized within the {{frameworks}} of government decision-making, the agencies {{responsible for these}} decisions are increasingly turning to environmental assessment (EA) processes {{as one of the}} principal vehicles for carrying out those consultations. This article explores the practical and theoretical dimensions of using EA processes to implement the duties <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> and accommodate. The relationship between EA and the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> has arisen in a number of cases and a clear picture is emerging of the steps that agencies conducting EAs must carry out in order to discharge their constitutional <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> Aboriginal peoples. The paper examines the implementation of the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> through various stages of the EA processes, identifying the EA practices that are best able to satisfy the legal requirements and the aspirations of the duty <b>to</b> <b>consult,</b> as well as to identify areas that are likely to present challenges moving forward. The paper also considers the broader approach to EA that is more likely to contribute to the overarching goal of reconciliation. Here the central claim is that greater attention must be paid to the deliberative and justificatory qualities of EA...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications of transfers of undertakings is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings. Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses - the Transfer Directive. The paper aims to achieve a critical analysis of European regulations on the protection of employees' rights in the event of transfer of undertakings {{as a result of a}} merger. The scope of the Transfer Directive, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> inform and <b>consult</b> employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result of a merger are being approached. In the study, matters on which the current European legal framework requires improvements so that the achieving of its objective be possible beyond interpretation and controversy are highlighted...|$|R
