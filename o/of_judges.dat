50|$|The most {{developed}} {{aspect of}} virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory <b>of</b> <b>judging.</b> A virtue-centered theory <b>of</b> <b>judging</b> offers {{an account of}} the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge.

5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels <b>of</b> <b>judges.</b> In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E

5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment.

5|$|Ability <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> {{to balance}} {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials.

This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E

5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law.
