She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of <b>office</b> <b>administrator</b> in her absence.

She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} transcendental phenomenological {{study was to examine}} the life experiences of 11 central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> from rural school divisions in Virginia, and investigate their shared experiences when assisting and supporting marginal special education teachers. The four theories guiding this study were Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, Collins, Brown and Newman’s cognitive apprenticeship theory, Evans’ path-goal leadership theory, and Burns’ transformational leadership theory. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory discusses the environment of a child impacts their growth and development. Collins, Brown, and Newman’s cognitive apprenticeships theory in context of this study describes how master teachers or administrators must train marginal teachers. Evans’ path-goal leadership theory pertains to this study by encouraging administrators to provide supports to teachers to meet necessary goals. Burns’ transformational leadership theory supports the idea that administrators must provide motivation to their teaching staff in order to raise them to acceptable levels. This study used the following research questions: R 1 : How do central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> in rural school districts in Virginia describe their experiences when working with marginal special education teachers?

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} central offices {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} central office in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's central office supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the central office and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> create and establish effective support for school principals.

The {{purpose of this}} qualitative study is to examine perceptions of women central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> who do not aspire to the superintendency {{in order to better}} understand this lack of aspiration. In addition, the study examined perceptions of aspiring women to provide a comparative base. Specifically, the study uncovered 1) perceptions related {{to the nature of the}} superintendency, and 2) conceptions and practices of power. This purpose was achieved through a secondary analysis of a pre-existing data set drawn from the American Association of School Administrators (AASA) National Study of U. S. Women Superintendents and Central <b>Office</b> <b>Administrators</b> (Brunner & Grogan, 2007). The study analyzed data from 5 of 8 open-ended questions contained in the survey through an emergent theme analysis method. The conceptual framework for the study was an adaptation of Farmer`s (1985) Model of Career and Achievement Motivation and also contained elements of Bandura`s (1986) Social Cognitive Theory. Data was sorted through an open coding procedure in order to discover patterns or concepts and also allow for a systematic analysis of the data. Conclusions of the study on the effects of background, environmental, and personal elements are: 1) It was concluded that background characteristics have very little, if any, affect on aspiration to the superintendency; 2) Environmental elements identified by participants were school boards and politics, although aspiring women ranked school boards at a much higher rate. Recent research by Kim and Brunner (2009) indicates that career paths of aspiring and non-aspiring women central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> differ in that aspiring women come up through line positions and non-aspiring women come up through staff positions. The different paths may shape their perceptions through the experiences to which they are exposed; 3) Personal elements (conceptions of power) identified with high frequency by non-aspiring and aspiring women central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> were influence and collaboration. A notable difference was that aspiring women identified research and data at a higher rate of frequency. Again, power perceptions may be influenced by career path experiences. It was also found the non-aspiring women central <b>office</b> <b>administrators</b> were more likely to identify with power as power-over than were aspiring women. This discovery may be used to inform superintendent preparation programs to train women about their understanding and use of power. Other emergent themes that hold possibility for future research was the identification of long hours and hard work. Although both groups identified long hours as a way they get things done, non-aspiring women deemed the work as hard as a much higher frequency than aspiring women; 4) The high frequency themes identified in What else needs to be known was Good Old Boys and Gender-bias by both groups. A notable difference between the groups was that aspiring women were more concerned about mentors and networks than non-aspiring women. This finding may have implications for professional organizations...|$|R
