It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament {{on a platform of}} support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E
5|$|Mild {{impairment}} <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> concentration {{may occur}} in any mental illness {{where people are}} anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities {{may be associated with}} pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E

5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> perception.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E

25|$|Negative priming is {{believed}} to {{play a crucial role}} in attention and memory retrieval processes. When stimuli are perceived through the senses, all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own internal representation. In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in short-term memory. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>and</b> memory.|$|E
