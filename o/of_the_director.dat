5|$|During post-production, as the {{producers}} {{decided to change}} the film into a more serious horror film, they filmed numerous scenes for that purpose without the participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director.</b> Among those scenes is the entire prologue of the astronauts in space and West waking up in a hospital--these are the only scenes in which Rebar's face is seen without makeup. Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by {{the producers}}.

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I, and the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. Queen Mary received her director before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} under the command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E

5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> {{to align}} along an {{external}} field {{is caused by}} the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I and the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. Lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>director,</b> Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{created the}} Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the {{functions}} and assets of the Manhattan Project. President Harry S. Truman appointed its five commissioners on 28 October 1946, and Groves appointed Nichols as the military liaison officer to the AEC. Nichols' main responsibility was to help organize an orderly transfer of assets and responsibilities from the MED to the AEC. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E
