25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E

2500|$|In June, 2008, Taguba {{was again}} in the {{headlines}} when he wrote the preface {{to a report by}} Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner [...] abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison, in Guantanamo Bay, and in Afghanistan. In it, he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes and called for the prosecution of those responsible. He wrote, [...] "There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes.

2500|$|A 2004 book on Russian {{floating}} {{nuclear power}} stations {{was written by}} a number of authors, including [...] "Vladimir Kuznetsov, formerly of the Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety; Alexey Yablokov, a biologist, former environmental advisor to the Russian president and president of the Center for Russian Environmental Policy; Yevgeney Simonov, senior engineer at the Obninsk nuclear power plant; Vladimir Desyatov, an engineer who worked in nuclear submarine construction; and Alexander Nikitin." [...] The book concludes that such stations are impossible to protect against terrorism, that safety cannot be guaranteed ("The <b>only</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how serious the emergency and its consequences."), and that an accident would be uniquely difficult to contain. Besides that, the book argues that such stations would be uneconomic.|$|E
