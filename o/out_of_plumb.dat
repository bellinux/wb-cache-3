The towers are {{designed}} as working minarets, a traditional element of mosques, a place for a muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chhatri that echoes the design of those on the tomb. The minaret chhatris share the same finishing touches: a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. Each of the minarets was constructed slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>plumb</b> to the outside of the plinth, so that in the event of collapse (a typical occurrence with many such tall constructions of the period) the structure would fall away from the tomb.|$|E

Helen Gardner refers to its [...] "unsurpassable excellence", to be surveyed, studied and emulated by architects of later ages. Yet, as Gardner points out, there is hardly a straight line in the building. Banister Fletcher calculated that the stylobate curves upward so that its centres at either end rise about 2.6inches above the outer corners, and 4.3inches on the longer sides. A slightly greater adjustment has been made to the entablature. The columns at the ends of the building are not vertical but are inclined towards the centre, with those at the corners being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>plumb</b> by about 2.6inches. These outer columns are both slightly wider than their neighbours and are slightly closer than any of the others.|$|E

60|$|Behind {{the black}} boles of the elms that swept the vista {{of the street}} with the fine gray tracery of their boughs, stood the houses, deep-sunken in the accumulating drifts, through which each householder kept a path cut from his doorway to the road, white and clean as if hewn out of marble. Some cross streets straggled away east and west with the poorer dwellings; but this, that {{followed}} the northward and southward reach of the plain, was the main thoroughfare, and had its own impressiveness, with those square white houses which they build so large in Northern New England. They were all kept in scrupulous repair, though here and there the frost and thaw of many winters had heaved a fence <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>plumb,</b> and threatened the poise of the monumental urns of painted pine on the gate-posts. They had dark-green blinds, of a color harmonious {{with that of the}} funereal evergreens in their dooryards; and they themselves had taken the tone of the snowy landscape, as if by the operation of some such law as blanches the fur-bearing animals of the North. They seemed proper to its desolation, while some houses of more modern taste, painted to a warmer tone, looked, with their mansard roofs and jig-sawed piazzas and balconies, intrusive and alien.|$|E

Deen got pipes, but not T joints to make the rungs; some were provided to him so he would not fail. After Andrew lashes out at everyone (Simon in particular) for not reading the instructions to the adhesive when assembling the ladder. Matt fails as he had purchased PVC adhesive instead of ABS adhesive (which {{would mean that the}} adhesion was, at best, only temporary). Cory fails as his adhesive sets before he assembles the whole ladder. Deen also fails when he admitted that he had never closed the adhesive can lid the whole time he was using it, which allowed the adhesive to set. Angela and Simon also fail, though Simon learns an important lesson on reading the instructions.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, experimenters {{noticed that}} bare speaker wires could deliver a jolt and began using {{recorded}} and live sound for electrostimulation. At that time, {{there were no}} professionally made attachments for such play, so people built their own <b>out</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>plumbing</b> parts and other metal pieces with attention to resistors placed in series with the human parts to control the current for safety. Although early e-stim units used only a simple, pulsed, sinusoidal wave, newer units use more complex wave forms and also allow {{for the use of}} ambient sound or prerecorded wave forms like music or specially designed computer files for specific types of stimulation. There are now sites dedicated to the creation of MP3 files specifically for erotic journeys or symphonies, which can include such routines as rewards, punishments, very strong, and pleasantly soft portions.|$|R

50|$|The {{frame members}} are {{generally}} made from plain rectangular stock but are often visually enhanced {{through the application}} of cock beading or applied mouldings. Typically a frame member will be between 25mm to 50mm in width, depending upon the application and the desired appearance of the cabinet. For built in cabinets, it is common for stiles that are to abut a wall to be cut wider than the final size so that these may be scribed to the shape of the wall. This compensates for <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>plumb</b> or uneven walls, which are common in many houses.|$|E

The building is distinctively 6 in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>plumb,</b> giving it a noticeable tilt, although its doorways and windows are properly square and plumb, suggesting that something occurred during construction to shift the frame of the building.

5000|$|The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic {{approach}} to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and {{for the fact that}} columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.The most obvious adjustment is to the profile of columns, which narrow from base to top. However, the narrowing is not regular, but gently curved so that each columns appears to have a slight swelling, called entasis below the middle. The entasis is never sufficiently pronounced as to make the swelling wider than the base; it is controlled by a slight reduction in the rate of decrease of diameter.The Parthenon, the Temple to the Goddess Athena on the Acropolis in Athens, is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture. Helen Gardner refers to its [...] "unsurpassable excellence", to be surveyed, studied and emulated by architects of later ages.
