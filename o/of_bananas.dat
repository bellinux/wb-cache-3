This experiment used changes in physical and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> to predict it's ripening rate. Moisture content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by using desiccation method and ripening stage <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by peel colour. Glucose (HK) Assay Kit was used to analyze glucose content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> and protein content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was analyzed by using Bradford reagent.

The results of applying oxygen absorber in banana packaging were unexpected, lowering oxygen level alone in banana packaging promote ripening instead of delaying. Applying moisture absorber in banana packaging supported my hypothesis that reducing relative humidity of packaging environment can speed up ripening process. However, moisture absorber is not able to absorb excess water droplet cause by sweeting of fruit. The results showed that moisture absorber and oxygen absorber were not suitable to be used in either promoting or delaying ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> because active packaging cannot solve sweating problem leading to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> fruits. ...|$|R

5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage.

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well.

5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter <b>of</b> <b>bananas.</b> By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around creatures known as Tikis, which {{are new to}} the series. The different types of Tikis fill {{the role of the}} antagonists in the story, replacing the Kremlings from Donkey Kong Country. Cranky Kong, who owns shops throughout the island, is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy. The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption, and play music to hypnotize the animals on the island into stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis' music, he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve his hoard <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> from the Tikis. Throughout the game, the pair travel through eight worlds to recover their stolen bananas: the Jungle, the Beach, the Ruins, the Cave, the Forest, the Cliff, the Factory, and the Volcano. In each world, they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader: Kalimba, the Maraca Triplets, Gong, Banjo, Panflute, Xylophone, Accordion (who hypnotizes other animals in the jungle to fight the Kongs), and Tiki Tong, the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe. After Tiki Tong is defeated, the Kongs are launched into space where they punch down on the Moon, crushing Tiki Tong's base and sending bananas flying everywhere.|$|E
