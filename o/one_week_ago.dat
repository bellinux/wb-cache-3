2500|$|Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye {{is set in}} 1935 India and is told through twelve {{letters and}} telegrams {{scattered}} throughout the queue as well as three newsreels shown before guests board the attraction. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has reunited missing fragments of a map scroll of parchment documenting the precise location of an ancient Bengalese temple. The Temple of the Forbidden Eye, containing countless intriguing artifacts buried beneath silt by a flood of the Lost River Delta over two thousand years ago, is undergoing excavation for archaeological research. The temple deity Mara seems to conditionally offer one of three gifts to all {{who come to the}} hallowed site: earthly riches, eternal youth, or visions of the future. The only condition is that one may never gaze into the eyes of Mara. Although Jones’ discovery, dubbed the [...] "Temple of the Forbidden Eye" [...] by the media, has set the archaeological community abuzz, his funding has run out. To raise money so the excavation can continue, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies / Bob Joles) has begun conducting guided tours. Good fortune has come to many of the tourists who survive, but others have not returned. Promising to find the missing tourists, Jones ventured inside the temple approximately <b>one</b> <b>week</b> <b>ago,</b> and has not yet reappeared. Jones also hoped to find the temple’s power source: the mysterious “Jewel of Power”, which Abner Ravenwood believed to be within an immense cavern, beyond the Gates of Doom. Marcus Brody has asked Sallah to continue conducting the tours, in the hope they may locate Dr. Jones.|$|E
2500|$|On both 23 May and 30 May after Friday prayers, tens of {{thousands}} of demonstrators rallied in various cities including Tripoli and Benghazi in support of Gen. Haftar and his campaign against Islamist militias and also in support of Haftar's calls to suspend parliament. In Benghazi, thousands of pro-Haftar demonstrators gathered outside Tibesti Hotel and in the city's Tahreer Square, as well as others in the city of Bayda further east. [...] "No to militias, Libya will not become another Afghanistan" [...] and [...] "Yes to the army, yes to the police", their banners read. Meanwhile, crowds in Tripoli's Martyr's Square chanted against the parliament and in support of a national army and police force to replace the militias that run rampant in the country. They sang the national anthem as they waved the flag and carried banners that read [...] "Yes to Dignity". They called for an official response to the militias. [...] "Libya is in trouble, we want police, we want army", they chanted. While some Libyans don't back Haftar and don't want military rule, they support what he is doing. The protest, dubbed the [...] "Friday of Dignity", took its name from the offensive launched by Haftar, <b>one</b> <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> in the eastern city of Benghazi. The demonstrations were some of the largest the country has seen since the uprising three years ago and were the first since then to be held simultaneously in cities across Libya, which put more pressure on the embattled Islamist-led parliament to offer concessions. The interim government issued a statement in support of Friday’s protests and reasserted its proposal this week to suspend parliament. [...] "The participation of tens {{of thousands}} [...] requires all to answer {{to the demands of the}} people who represent legitimacy that can't be ignored", the statement said.|$|E

40|$|RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) mediates post-transcriptional {{control of}} gene {{expression}} and contains Argonaute 2 (AGO 2) protein {{as a central}} effector of cleavage or inhibition of mRNA translation. In the brain, the RISC pathway is involved in neuronal functions, such as synaptic development and local protein synthesis, which are potentially critical for memory. In this study, we examined the role of RISC in memory formation in rodents, by silencing AGO 2 expression in dorsal hippocampus of C 57 BL/ 6 mice and submitting animals to hippocampus-related tasks. <b>One</b> <b>week</b> after surgery, <b>AGO</b> 2 downregulation impaired both short-term and long-term contextual fear memories. Conversely, no long-lasting effects were observed three weeks after surgery, when AGO 2 levels were re-established.

Scotiabank, by far the principal creditor guaranteed with a credit of almost CAD$36,000,000, had given an opinion of defect <b>one</b> <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> and half. Adventure Electronics, not having been able to find the funds necessary to the re-establishment of its situation, the chain, which was committed in a plan of rectification since the beginning of 1998, had to resign itself to close its 143 stores. This was blamed on rival Future Shop's expansion into Quebec in 1995.|$|E

50|$|BACK FROM ARIZONA. Mr. Mack Returns with Particulars of Mr. Marsh's Death:Mr. Stephen Mack, {{superintendent}} of the Golden Fleece Mining Company, and who was with the late John O. Marsh, when that gentleman died, <b>one</b> <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> to-day, arrived in town last evening. This morning he was immediately besieged {{by a host of}} inquiring friends who were anxious to learn further details concerning the death of our lamented fellow citizen. A DEMOCRAT representative called upon Mr. Mack at his residence on Green Street, and learned the following facts from him. When Mr. Marsh arrived in Arizona he was much wearied by the long, tedious journey, and the slight symptoms of illness which he then displayed were attributed to this cause. His sickness, however, increased so long before it developed into typhoid fever, the details and sad result of which have already been published. It is not necessary to give the particulars of the long days and sleepless nights that preceded the termination of the sad affair; it is sufficient to say that Mr. Mack affirms the statement that everything within the power of skillful medical attention and careful nursing was done to relieve the sufferer. In regard to the remains of the deceased, Mr. Mack says that it will be impossible to remove them to Ithaca until cold weather, for the frontier village where Mr. Marsh died is utterly void of those improved undertaking appliances for the preservation of remains so common in the east rapidly that it was not. When asked as to the prospects of the mining company which he represented, and the stock of which is largely owned by Ithaca gentlemen, Mr. Mack did not feel at liberty to talk upon that subject, although he said that he felt satisfied that they had a good claim. Mr. Mack left Arizona Sunday morning.The fate of the company is not known in detail, but very probably the interests and properties of the company were transferred to the Golden Fleece Mining and Milling Company (Iowa), which was incorporated 1893 under the laws of Iowa. George W. Peirce was the secretary and treasurer of both companies.|$|E
