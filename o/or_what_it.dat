More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

If MATCH PARTIAL is added after the REFERENCES declaration then any non-null must match the foreign key, e. g. ('Doe', NULL) would still match, but ('Smith', NULL) would not. Finally, if MATCH FULL is added then ('Smith', NULL) would not match the constraint either, but (NULL, NULL) would still match it.|$|E
500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he imagined it to take place ten years after the first game, as he thought that would be roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not even imagine what the world would look like a hundred years into the future <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> had been like during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei.

[...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt).

In a pattern typical of many older cities, Jackson's population had declined while its suburbs grew. Some people expect that pattern to change, noting people's renewed preferences for denser neighborhoods, city amenities, and other attractions. After 1980, the city population declined to the 2010 Census, with 173,514 citizens.

2500|$|For Tillich, {{the existential}} {{questions}} {{of human existence}} {{are associated with the}} field of philosophy and, more specifically, ontology (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be, to exist, to be a finite human being. [...] To be correlated with these questions are the theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation. [...] The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions. [...] However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich’s notion of faith as “ultimate concern” necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers. [...] Thus, {{on one side of the}} correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer. [...] This is because the Christian message claims, a priori, that the logos “who became flesh” is also the universal logos of the Greeks.|$|E

2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture.
