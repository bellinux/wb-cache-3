Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern slopes of the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal.

5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} {{writing at the}} University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles {{as part of the}} National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shore</b> <b>of</b> the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Itza Maya from Motul de San José began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the Yucatán Peninsula {{at the end of the}} Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the King of the Itzá, demonstrating that the Itza were already in the Petén region at this time.

5|$|Motul de San José {{has been}} {{identified}} as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities. The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Carillon, {{also known}} as the 1758 Battle of Ticonderoga, was fought on July 8, 1758, during the French and Indian War (which was part of the global Seven Years' War).

5|$|The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also {{known as}} the Stone House, the William R.

It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, {{including}} R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts.

5|$|The Dominicans {{established}} {{themselves in}} Xocolo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century.

5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871. By October, {{the men were}} wintering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> northern Greenland, making preparations {{for the trip to}} the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him.

5|$|After {{crossing}} the eastern terminus of CR52 (WilsonBurt Road), NY78 continues north {{through the town}} of Newfane, entering the hamlet of Burt. Through Burt, the route passes a former railroad grade at Railroad Avenue and passes east of Fisherman's Park. Continuing north, NY78 enters the hamlet of Olcott. In Olcott, NY78 retains the name of LockportOlcott Road, becoming a two-lane residential road. The route soon bends northwest, intersecting with NY18 (Lake Road) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> Eighteenmile Creek. This intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY78, while the right-of-way continues north as Lockport Street, which terminates at the shore of Lake Ontario.|$|E

5|$|After this battle, the Rhodian admirals {{decided to}} leave Chios and sail back home. On {{the way back to}} Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he {{received}} at Chios, but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes.

5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> the Sea of Galilee. A squadron of the 9th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. By the time they arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th Light Horse Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on stores of grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E
5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>of</b> Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E
