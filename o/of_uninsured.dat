5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an {{organisation}} run {{by several}} insurance {{companies in the}} absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{generally}} ranks highly {{among states}} in most health and disease prevention categories. In 2014, the United Health Foundation ranked {{the state as}} third-healthiest overall. Massachusetts has the most doctors per 100,000 residents, the second-lowest infant mortality rate, and the lowest percentage <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> residents (for both {{children as well as}} the total population). According to Businessweek, commonwealth residents have an average life expectancy of 78.4 years, the fifth-longest in the country. 37.2% of the population is overweight and 21.7% is obese, and Massachusetts ranks sixth-highest in the percentage of residents who are considered neither obese nor overweight (41.1%). Massachusetts also ranks above average in the prevalence of binge drinking, which is the 20th-highest in the country.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Omar's {{landfall}} in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada {{declared a}} state of emergency, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses, helping over 11,000people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> public buildings, although it usually only provide 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27members of the Guam National Guard and 700members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government. The local Red Cross provided $6million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September30.|$|E
25|$|From 2006, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> Massachusetts {{residents}} dropped from about 6% to about 2% in 2010 {{according to the}} Massachusetts Department of Healthcare Finance and Policy (DHCFP), depending on the methodology used, According to the Massachusetts Center on Health Information and Analsysis (CHIA), which replaced the DHCFP in 2012, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> rose back to between 3–4% in 2012. The United States Census Department shows a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> for the same years but a similar trend line. Both trend lines mirror—from different baselines—the approximately 400,000 Massachusetts residents added to the rolls of the insured in 2006/2007 via an expansion in Medicaid eligibility rules and the subsidization of the Commonwealth Care insurance program.|$|E

Nearly one fifth <b>of</b> the <b>uninsured</b> population is able to afford insurance, almost one quarter is eligible for public coverage, and the remaining 56% need financial assistance (8.9% of all Americans).

40|$|ABSTRACT Access to {{care is a}} {{major problem}} in urban America that {{increasingly}} affects new segments of the population. Although the demographic profile <b>of</b> the <b>uninsured</b> has changed, recording large increases in numbers <b>of</b> moderate-income <b>uninsured</b> persons, it has not been accompanied by changes in health care safety net programs or increased availability of private insurance products tailored to these groups. Any such changes, however, need to be based on a good understanding of the similarities and differences between low-income and moderate-income uninsured. Based on a telephone survey <b>of</b> the <b>uninsured</b> in three northern New Jersey counties, this study presents a systematic comparison of low-income (below 150 % of federal poverty level) and moderateincome (150 % to 350 % federal poverty level) uninsured on attitudes to health care, perceptions regarding access to care, health status, and health care utilization. We discuss the implications of this comparison for expanding health care access and design of safety net programs and institutions...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, about 68% of all U.S. women age 40-64 had {{a mammogram}} {{in the past}} two years (75% of women with private health insurance, 56% of women with Medicaid insurance, 38% <b>of</b> {{currently}} <b>uninsured</b> women, and 33% <b>of</b> women <b>uninsured</b> for more than 12 months).All U.S. states except Utah require private health insurance plans and Medicaid to pay for breast cancer screening. As of 1998, Medicare (available to those aged 65 or older or who have been on Social Security Disability Insurance for over 2 years) pays for annual screening mammography in women aged 40 or older.|$|R
25|$|Under 2017 American Health Care Act (AHCA) {{legislation}} {{under the}} House and Senate, both versions of proposed Republican bills have proposed cuts to Medicaid funding on differing timelines. Under both bills, the Congressional Budget Office has rated these as reducing coverage of Americans by Medicaid, with the Senate bill reducing costs of Medicaid {{by the year}} 2026 with by a reduction of cost by 26 percent in comparison to projections of ACA subsidies. Additionally, CBO estimated have predicted number <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> rising under AHCA from 28 million persons to 49 million (under the Senate bill) or to 51 (under the House Bill).|$|E
25|$|The reduced state HSN {{payments}} anticipated (but not realized), that {{by reducing}} the number <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> people, Commonwealth Care would {{reduce the amount of}} charity care provided by hospitals. In a subsequent story that same month, The Boston Globe reported that Commonwealth Care faced a short-term funding gap of $100 million and the need to obtain a new three-year funding commitment from the federal government of $1.5 billion. By June 2011, enrollment was projected to grow to 342,000 people at an annual expense of $1.35 billion. The original projections were for the program to ultimately cover approximately 215,000 people at a cost of $725 million.|$|E
25|$|Applicants for driver's {{licenses}} {{would not}} be required to prove legal immigration status and would be allowed to present a foreign passport as identification. At that point, eight other states did not require individuals to prove their legal immigration status when applying for a driver's licenses. Spitzer said that the new policy would help all New Yorkers by improving traffic safety, because unlicensed drivers are nearly five times as likely to be in fatal car crashes compared to licensed drivers. Spitzer also claimed that the policy would effectively allow illegal immigrants to buy auto insurance, which would reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> drivers in the state and therefore decrease insurance premiums for all New Yorkers by an estimated $120 million.|$|E

40|$|The problem <b>of</b> the <b>uninsured</b> - those eschewing the {{purchase}} of health insurance policies - cannot be fully understood without considering informal alternatives to market insurance called self-insurance and self-protection, including the publicly and charitably-financed safety-net health care system. This paper tackles the problem <b>of</b> the <b>uninsured</b> by formulating a full-insurance paradigm that includes all 4 measures of insurance as interacting components, and analyzing their interdependencies. We apply both a baseline and extended versions of the model through calibrated simulations to estimate {{the degree to which}} these non-market alternatives can account for the fraction of the non-elderly adults who are uninsured, and estimate their behavioral and policy ramifications. Our results indicate that policy analyses that do not consider the role of self-efforts to avoid health losses can grossly distort the success of the ACA mandate to insure the uninsured and to improve the health and welfare outcomes <b>of</b> the previously <b>uninsured...</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{concern is}} the rate <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being {{conducted}} a survey {{and found that the}} uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.|$|E
25|$|The Affordable Care Act faced {{considerable}} {{challenges and}} opposition after its passage, and Republicans continually attempted {{to repeal the}} law. The law also survived two major challenges {{that went to the}} Supreme Court. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a 5-4 majority upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, though it made state Medicaid expansion voluntary. In King v. Burwell, a 6-3 majority allowed the use of tax credits in state-operated exchanges. The October 2013 launch of HealthCare.gov, a health insurance exchange website created under the provisions of the ACA, was widely criticized, though many of the problems were fixed {{by the end of the}} year. The number <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> Americans dropped from 20.2% of the population in 2010 to 13.3% of the population in 2015, though Republicans continued to oppose Obamacare as an unwelcome expansion of government. Many liberals continued to push for a single-payer healthcare system or a public option, and Obama endorsed the latter proposal, as well as an expansion of health insurance tax credits, in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Brownsville {{suffers from}} major health disparities in {{comparison}} to the rest of New York City. In 2006, Brownsville had the highest infant mortality rate in New York City (12.5 per 1,000 births), twice the overall city rate (5.9 per 1,000 births). Preterm and teenage births were also more common in Brownsville than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 13.8 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 9.0 per 1,000 citywide), and 38.5 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 23.6 per 1,000 citywide), giving the area the second-highest teenage birth rate of any neighborhood in the city. In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span (74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood. A New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community health profile the next year found that in Brownsville, the average life expectancy is more than ten years shorter than in Manhattan's Financial District. Brownsville has a high population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through Medicaid. In 2015, this population <b>of</b> <b>uninsured</b> residents was estimated to be 18%, which is lower than the citywide rate of 20%, and is expected to decrease in coming years because of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.|$|E
5000|$|Proponents of no-fault {{insurance}} {{argue that}} automobile collisions are inevitable and that at-fault drivers {{are not necessarily}} higher risk and should not necessarily be punished; moreover, they note {{that the presence of}} liability insurance insulates reckless or negligent drivers from financial disincentives <b>of</b> litigation; also, <b>uninsured</b> motorists are often [...] "judgment proof" [...] (i.e., can't and won't end up paying for their liability anyway), so that in regions with high numbers <b>of</b> such <b>uninsured</b> motorists, no-fault systems may make more sense.|$|R
