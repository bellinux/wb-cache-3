The methodology relies on dynamic simulations carried out with Daysim and EnergyPlus used in synergy to perform a parametric study to assess the indoor daylighting conditions and the energy performance of rooms with different architectural features: room depth, window size, external <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> and glazing visible transmittance. Furthermore, different lighting and shading control strategies were tested.

40|$|Under low {{latitude}} conditions, minimisation {{of solar}} irradiance within the urban environment may often {{be an important}} criterion in urban design. This can be achieved when the <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> is large (high H/W ratio, H = height, W = width). Solar access to streets can always be decreased by increasing H/W to larger values. It is shown in this paper that the street canyon orientation (and not only the H/W ratio) has a considerable effect on solar shading and urban microclimate. The paper demonstrates {{through a series of}} shading simulation and temperature measurements that a number of useful relationships can be developed between the geometry and the microclimate of urban street canyons. These relationships are potentially helpful to assist in the formulation of urban design guidelines governing street dimensions and orientations for use by urban designers...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} (PHOENICS) {{was used to}} investigate the role of stream deflector angle and length on the flow field in a rectangular laboratory flume. Subsequent bed topography surveys were performed to examine the role of <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> on scour hole development over time. The model was capable of predicting laboratory velocity and turbulent kinetic energy measurements, performing better for flow over a flat stable bed than over a deformed sand bed. A new method of incorporating complex bed topography into a structured Cartesian mesh {{was developed in the}} process. Flow field properties such as dynamic pressure, velocity amplification, separation zone length and width, and downwelling extent and magnitude were found to be strongly dependent on deflector geometry. Equilibrium scour hole depths and geometry are also angle-dependent. A predictive equation was produced explaining the rate at which scour holes reach equilibrium, and compared well with existing literature. Finally, a method was developed whereby characteristics of the flow field over a flat, stable bed could be used to predict equilibrium scour hole geometry...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new computer}} model for city skyline simulation. It works by shaping medium and high-rise buildings to their best performance. This new tool was conceived to simulate and analyze cities where tall buildings are emerging on pre-existing urban schemes with irregular geometry and where inter-building spacing {{is proportional to the}} height of built blocks. The model is based on two main inputs, namely: the description of the network formed by land subdivision of the actual or irregular urban schemes, and the building regulations quantitative parameters based on solar <b>obstruction</b> <b>angles</b> and maximum usability rates. By combining data from these inputs, the computer model presents the dimensions of the building envelop for maximum profitability of each plot. That way the architect will immediately know the number of floors that leads to the maximum built area, for certain plots. In addition to this, the built blocks images are presented in the screen, as well as corresponding tables and Cartesian graphs. Furthermore, this model can also be used for analyzing city skyline for large urban areas. This analysis can range from a mere visual inspection of the variety of images built blocks will take under different legal constraints, to a more intricate analysis of how city skyline and built area, amongst others, are affected by different the regulations...|$|R
40|$|Many Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) {{versions}} {{have been}} proposed and some are in use today for terrestrial wired networks over the Internet Protocol (IP), e. g. Tahoe, Reno and many others. TCP/IP is being studied to overcome its limitations within the satellite medium and to allow its use in hybrid terrestrial/satellite networks. Studies mainly concentrate on use of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) constellations. However interest in use of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations is increasing, especially for multimedia transmissions within the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). This paper aims at providing some TCP performance results in a satellite scenario, both with GEO and LEO satellites. First it discusses some main problems of adaptation of the protocol to a satellite environment. Then it presents basic characteristics of some main TCP versions. Finally, it provides simulation results for goodput in case of LEO polar and inclined constellations. Results are provided both for an unshadowed scenario and for shadowed scenarios.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from a parametric study that assessed {{the amount of}} daylight in rooms with different architectural features: the orientation, window size and visible glazing transmittance, room depth, external <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> and site. Annual lighting simulations were run {{in order to understand}} how the daylight availability within a space changes {{as a function of the}} architectural features. A sub-dataset of the full result database is examined in detail for north- and south-facing rooms in Turin, north-west Italy, with a visible glazing transmittance of 70 %.

This was developed to provide a synthesis of information to the design team. It shows the influence of preliminary design solutions on the amount of indoor daylight.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical tool which {{is intended to}} be used during the earliest design stages to predict the daylight amount within a space as a function of different architectural features. The daylight amount is expressed in terms of Daylighting Dynamic Performance Metrics, DDPM, resulting from a climate based daylighting simulation. The tool was built based on the results from a parametric study carried out for a sample room with different room orientation and depth, window area, visible transmittance and external <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle.</b> The analysis was repeated for three sites, representative of different climate conditions (Turin and Catania - Italy - and Berlin - Germany). The paper describes the graphical tool which was developed and how it could be fruitfully used by the design team to predict the daylight availability within a space. Potentials and drawbacks of the proposed tool are also discussed in comparison with other tools which are commonly used during the earliest design stages of the daylighting design process (such as the average daylight factor formula or the recent software Lightsolve). It is shown that the information obtained through the different tools is consistent and that the proposed graphical tool can be useful for the design team, as it offers different information about the daylight availability within the designed spac...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Patients with OSAS (obstructive {{sleep apnea}} syndrome) {{demonstrate}} decreased upper airway dimension and craniofacial skeletal abnormalities. The study {{was performed to}} analyze whether upper airway dimensions differed among Chinese nonsnoring children of different sagittal and vertical skeletal facial morphologies. Materials and Methods: Lateral cephalometric records were {{used to measure the}} dimensions of the upper airway. Two groups of subjects were studied. A group of subjects with a normodivergent facial pattern (n 5 190; FH-MP angle between 23. 5 u and 30. 5 u) was divided into three subgroups according to ANB angle (Class I, II, or III). A second group of subjects with a normal sagittal facial pattern (n 5 180; ANB angle between 0. 7 u and 4. 7 u) was divided into three subgroups according to the FH-MP angle (low angle, normal angle, or high angle). All subgroups were matched for age and sex. Results: In the group of subjects with a normodivergent facial pattern, a significant tendency for reduced upper airway dimension in the inferior part (palatopharyngeal and hypopharynx) was found in the Class III, Class I, and Class II subgroups, in that order. In the group of subjects with a normal sagittal facial pattern, the superior part of the airway (nasopharyngeal and palatophar-yngeal) decreased with increasing mandibular plane angle. Conclusion: The sagittal and vertical skeletal patterns may be contributory factors for the variation of the inferior and superior part of the upper airway, respectively. Skeletal deficiency of nonsnoring Chinese children may predispose them to upper airway <b>obstruction.</b> (<b>Angle</b> Orthod. 2010; 80 : 267...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tiotropium is a potent, long-acting, {{selective}} anticholinergic bronchodilator. Treatment with tiotropium produces sustained {{improvements in}} lung function, particularly FEV 1 (peak, trough, average, and area under the curve) compared with either placebo or ipratropium {{in patients with}} moderate to severe COPD. Preliminary evidence suggests that treatment with tiotropium may slow the rate of decline in FEV 1, but this finding awaits confirmation. Tiotropium reduces lung hyperinflation, with associated improvements in exercise capacity. Tiotropium, compared with either placebo or ipratropium, improves a variety of patient-centered outcomes, including subjective dyspnea ratings and HRQL scores. Tiotropium reduces the frequency of COPD exacerbations and of hospitalizations due to exacerbations, but has not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality. Compared with the long-acting bronchodilators, tiotropium provides incrementally better bronchodilation, {{but it is not}} clearly superior in terms of patient-centered outcomes. Tiotropium has a good safety profile; however patients with severe cardiac disease, bladder outlet <b>obstruction,</b> or narrow <b>angle</b> glaucoma were excluded from all studies. Medico economic analyses suggest that treatment with tiotropium may also be cost-effective, primarily by reducing costs associated with hospitalizations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{appropriate}} daylighting design can influence the global energy performance of a building as well as the visual and thermal comfort for the occupants. Furthermore the increasing awareness of the potential benefits of daylight has resulted in an increased need for objective information and data on the impact that different design solutions can have on the daylighting condition within a space, in relation with the architectural features. This kind of analysis {{is becoming more and more}} requested, during all stages of the design process. The purpose of this paper is to describe a reliable simulation approach to consider daylight when assessing the energy performance of a building. The methodology is based on the use of both Daysim and EnergyPlus which were employed in synergy for a parametric study to assess lighting and energy performances of rooms with different architectural features: orientation, window size and glazing visible transmittance, room depth, external <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> and site. Daysim was chosen to perform daylighting analyses since it allows us to accurately estimate the annual amount of daylight in a space and calculating climate-based daylight metrics as well as the annual electric lighting use for different lighting controls. The Daysim output file that describes the status of all lighting and shading groups in the space during the year was then used as input in EnergyPlus to estimate the influence of the daylighting and artificial lighting design on the global energy performance of a space. The paper presents some considerations on the simulation approach adopted in the study and the most important results that were obtained in terms of daylighting conditions and energy demand for lighting, heating and cooling, to demonstrate the substantial influence of daylight harvesting on the reduction of the global energy performanc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} energy demand for {{electric}} lighting in office buildings: in particular, aim {{of the study is}} to estimate the variation of electric lighting energy demand in response to changes in some building features such as orientation, room depth (from a private to an open-plan office), window size (expressed in terms of window- to-wall ratio, which was varied in the range 0, 2 - 0, 6) and external obstruction (varied in the range 0 ° - 75 ° of <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle).</b> Furthermore, the impact of a daylight responsive lighting control system with respect to manual control is also considered. As a first step, the analysis is carried out for the climatic conditions of Turin, Italy (latitude: 45 ° north). The software DAYSIM, which allows calculating daylighting availability and its integration with electric lighting through a dynamic climate-based annual simulation, was used for the purpose. Daylighting and energy demand were first calculated for a single office room; simulations were repeated changing the different building features. During a second phase, a number of simplified sample office buildings were considered: these were obtained by putting together some of the north-facing and south- facing single rooms which were simulated individually. The Lighting Energy Numerical Indicator value (LENI) was finally calculated for the sample buildings. The results obtained in the study are intended to provide architects and designers with more detailed information about the consequences on daylighting and energy demand {{for electric lighting}} due to different architectural solutions, as well as, the other way around, with strategies to guarantee a desired energy and/or environmental performance. Results are hence expressed in terms of: comparison between the lighting energy demand for a manual and for a daylight-responsive control system; correlation of the energy demand to a daylight factor criterion; percent variation of energy demand as building features vary (room depth, WWR, obstruction angles), highlighting for which combination a manual or a daylight responsive control system is worthwhil...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{within the field of}} {{daylight}} in buildings. The purpose of the work has been to investigate how daylighting systems could improve the daylight uniformity and increase the daylight levels in the inner part of sidelighted offices. This is studied through full-scale and scale model experiments together with computer simulations. In sidelighted interiors the available daylight decreases rapidly with the distance from the window. The main parameters influencing the daylight distribution are daylight availability, building and window location, surface photometric properties and room geometry. The first part of the thesis shows which effect these parameters have for the daylight distribution. Daylighting systems are modifications in the windows with the intention of redirecting incoming daylight into the darker zones of deep rooms. It can be special types of glass, reflectors or other optical systems that reject, scatter or redirect the daylight in controlled directions. A lot of different daylighting systems are available, and those suitable for windows are presented shortly. A more detailed presentation is given for those systems investigated for quantitative performances; light shelves, venetian blind, prismatic panels and laser-cut panels. These daylighting systems were investigated in full-scale measurements under natural sky conditions and under an artificial overcast sky. The full-scale experiments were carried out under the natural sky in six daily occupied office rooms situated in Sandvika, near Oslo. Five rooms were adapted for experimental measurements of daylighting systems and one room was used as reference without daylighting system. In total four daylighting systems were examined; two light shelves with different surface properties, one prismatic panel and one laser-cut panel. The daylighting systems were investigated under both overcast sky and clear sky conditions. The results show that frequently changes in the sky luminance distribution make reproducibility of results difficult, and it was found that further daylighting experiments should be performed in more controllable surroundings. As a consequence, calibrations and fundamental tests were carried out for a newly built artificial sky in the daylight laboratory at the Department of Building technology, NTNU. The artificial sky, an octagonal box consisting of a luminous ceiling with mirrored walls which produce an infinite series of reflections. The distance between corresponding pairs of parallel mirrors is approximately 3. 5 m, and the height of the box is 1. 5 m. The investigations showed good reproducibility for quantitative daylighting measurements. The results also showed good agreement with corresponding experiments under both natural and artificial overcast sky performed by other researchers. A sample group of daylighting systems were evaluated with the objectives to increase the daylight level in the intermediate and rear part of a sidelighted room, and to level out the daylight distribution throughout the working plane. A corresponding model situation without any window modifications served as reference. Only a few of the investigated daylighting systems showed satisfactory performance data with respect to the evaluation parameters. • Exterior light shelves level out the daylight distribution throughout the room depth. Depending on the shelf and ceiling surface properties a positive angle of inclination can increase the daylight level in the rear wall zone up to 55 %. • Laser-cut panels vertically fixed on the facade give a more uniform daylight distribution. A positive cut angle of 10 ° can increase the daylight level in the inner part of the room with 25 % to 50 %. • Tilted laser-cut panels above the daylight window produce somewhat better daylight uniformity in the working area. Depending of tilt angle and ceiling properties the daylight evel in the rear wall zone can be increased up to 25 %. The strategy of these daylighting systems is to utilize daylight from the bright zenith of the sky vault to increase the daylight levels in the inner part of the rooms. The investigations show that the relative effect increases {{as a function of the}} height of the horizon obstruction. Daylighting systems can thus be an effective solution to increase the daylight levels in situations where obstructions reduce the daylight to unacceptable levels. To prepare for adequate daylight conditions in the interior there is a need for instructions related to the site planning stage. By computer simulations, a parameter study evaluated how the obstruction height and surface reflectances influence the daylight level in a sidelighted office room. The results showed that: • A horizon <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> should be kept smaller than 25 ° to give potential for good daylighting in the interior of a sidelighted room. • A critical <b>obstruction</b> <b>angle</b> of 40 ° should not be exceeded. • For obstruction angles between these two values more detailed analyses should be carried out. Factors to be considered for each specific building are the window design (area and location), the room depth and the surface reflectances within and outside the building. This work has focused on quantitative performance data for daylighting systems under overcast sky conditions. To obtain a complete picture for the selected systems, the following investigations should also be performed: • mapping of data under sun conditions • evaluation of other performance parameters (luminance distribution, glare etc) Attention should also be paid to daylighting systems not considered in this work. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
