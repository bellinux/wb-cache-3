5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

Now that TOEFL is computer based, listening comprehension items are being created that include both audio and visual information. A nested cross-over design (participants nested in pro ciency, level and form) {{was used to examine}} the effects of visual condition (present or absent), type <b>of</b> <b>stimuli</b> (dialogues/short conversations, academic discussions and mini-talks) and language pro ciency (high or low) on performance on CBT (Computer-based Test) listening comprehension items.

On the fifth anniversary of the library's opening, Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state. In 2009, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010. On September 30, 2011, Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge, which opened to the public on October 2, 2011.|$|E

30|$|This {{possibility}} is {{also consistent with}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>stimuli</b> on pair correlations.

Here we wanted to investigate whether duration judgments <b>of</b> digit visual <b>stimuli</b> are biased depending {{on the side of}} space where the stimuli are presented and on the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>stimulus</b> itself. Different groups of healthy subjects performed duration judgments tasks on various types <b>of</b> visual <b>stimuli.</b> In the first two experiments visual stimuli were constituted by digit pairs (1 and 9), presented in the centre of the screen or in the right and left space. In a third experiment visual stimuli were constituted by black circles. The duration <b>of</b> the reference <b>stimulus</b> was fixed at 300 ms. Subjects had to indicate the relative duration <b>of</b> the test <b>stimulus</b> compared with the reference one.

25|$|The diffuse-light flash {{stimulus}} {{is rarely}} used nowadays {{due to the}} high variability within and across subjects. However, it is beneficial to use this type <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> when testing infants, animals or individuals with poor visual acuity.

These squares and stripes are equal in size and are presented, one image at a time, via a computer screen.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in fMRI signal {{in response to}} a stimulus is additive. This means that the amplitude of the hemodynamic response (HDR) increases when multiple stimuli are presented in rapid succession. When each block is alternated with a rest condition in which the HDR has enough time to return to baseline, a maximum amount of variability is introduced in the signal. As such, we conclude that block designs offer considerable statistical power. There are however severe drawbacks to this method, as the signal is very sensitive to signal drift, such as head motion, especially when only a few blocks are used. Another limiting factor is a poor choice of baseline, as it may prevent meaningful conclusions from being drawn. There are also problems with many tasks lacking the ability to be repeated. Since within each block only one condition is presented, randomization <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> types is not possible within a block. This makes the type <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> within each block very predictable. As a consequence, participants may become aware of the order of the events.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} {{allows the}} SSEP to directly control the stimulus that elicits the SSEP without the conscious {{intervention of the}} experimental subject. For example, the running average of the SSEP can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the SSEP falls below some predetermined value, and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value. The amplitude of the SSEP then hovers about this predetermined value. Now the wavelength (colour) of the stimulus is progressively changed. The resulting plot <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} body a {{stimulus}} refers {{to a form of}} energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. Sensory receptors are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another.

Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory neurons; modified to deal with specific types <b>of</b> <b>stimulus,</b> thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body.

25|$|A {{source of}} {{nonlinearity}} in the fMRI response {{is from the}} refractory period, where brain activity from a presented stimulus suppresses further activity on a subsequent, similar, stimulus. As stimuli become shorter, the refractory period becomes more noticeable. The refractory period does not change with age, nor do the amplitudes of HDRs. The period differs across brain regions. In both the primary motor cortex and the visual cortex, the HDR amplitude scales linearly with duration of a stimulus or response. In the corresponding secondary regions, the supplementary motor cortex, which is involved in planning motor behavior, and the motion-sensitive V5 region, a strong refractory period is seen and the HDR amplitude stays steady across a range <b>of</b> <b>stimulus</b> or response durations. The refractory effect {{can be used in}} a way similar to habituation to see what features of a stimulus a person discriminates as new.|$|E

This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain {{times of the day}} and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy, which is often used to help early morning wakers reset their natural sleep cycle, can also be used with sleep restriction therapy to reinforce a new wake schedule.
