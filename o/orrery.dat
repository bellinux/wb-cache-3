5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain {{to lobby for}} his release from prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and <b>Orrery,</b> and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was {{closely associated with the}} group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged {{his son in}} the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject {{to the extent that he}} constructed an <b>orrery,</b> much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, the old visitor centre {{closed and}} work on a new visitor centre started. The new Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on Monday 11 April 2011. It {{includes}} a new entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a new Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, and a glass-walled cafe {{with a view of}} the Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaping of the gardens including a new Galaxy Maze. A large <b>orrery</b> was installed in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Other {{exhibits}} in the revamped Astrocentre {{included a}} new 50-seat mini-theatre, wall murals illustrating the {{phases of the}} moon, plus {{an increasing number of}} hands-on exhibits and interactive computer-driven displays. There were also displays of astronomical globes, an <b>orrery</b> and pictures of the planets, many taken by contemporary space probes. The Astrocentre also featured the world's first commercial Stellarium, a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in our immediate stellar neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Tompion was {{the first}} English clockmaker with an {{international}} reputation {{and many of his}} pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat escapement, <b>orrery</b> and mercury pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge who created the first lever escapement. Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who used the Pinchbeck alloy.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the <b>orrery</b> demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1790s Dennie {{contributed to}} various journals, {{including}} the Federal <b>Orrery</b> and the Massachusetts Magazine, often using pen {{names such as}} Academicus and Socialis. In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, The Tablet. William Spotswood, a Boston printer and bookseller, agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel idea at the time, and it was well received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The <b>Orrery.</b> The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
5|$|In The <b>Orrery,</b> all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and {{the figure of the}} boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E

5000|$|After <b>Orrery's</b> {{death in}} 1679, his title was {{passed on to}} his oldest son. <b>Orrery's</b> second son had four sons of his own, Roger, Henry, Charles and William, {{and it was this}} Henry who {{became a member of the}} Privy Council of Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He was {{elevated}} to the peerage in 1756 as Baron Castlemartyr, Viscount Boyle, Earl of Shannon. It was he who provided the land for the construction of a new church in the village (St. Anne's Church of Ireland) when an act of Parliament allowed for the dismantling of Ballyoughtera Church and the re-use of some of the stones on the new Church.|$|R
50|$|First {{opened in}} 1949, the planetarium {{was used to}} train Gemini and Apollo program astronauts in {{celestial}} navigation.

The facility was donated to the university by alumnus John Motley Morehead III who invested more than $3 million in the facility.|$|R
50|$|John Fulton (1803 - 1853), was {{originally}} a cobbler or shoemaker by trade. He built three <b>orrerys</b> in a workshop attached to at his home, now demolished, in the Kirton Brae area of Fenwick and was eventually appointed instrument maker to King William IV, moving to London, but retiring to Fenwick. He {{is buried in}} the Fenwick Kirk graveyard.|$|R
25|$|The term planetarium is {{sometimes}} used generically to describe other devices which illustrate the solar system, {{such as a}} computer simulation or an <b>orrery.</b> Planetarium software refers to a software application that renders a three-dimensional image of the sky onto a two-dimensional computer screen. The term planetarian is used to describe {{a member of the}} professional staff of a planetarium.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 1704, Boyle married Mary Sackville, illegitimate {{daughter}} of Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset and widow of Lionel Boyle, 3rd Earl of <b>Orrery,</b> who died twelve years later, bearing no children. In January 1720, Boyle remarried, {{this time to}} Grace Senhouse, {{daughter of}} John Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumbria; they had one child, Grace, Countess of Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|With extreme sarcasm, Muratori ridicules {{not only}} {{the subject of the}} book, but also the style as well. Granting Kenney stylistic ability, he takes it to a level of sarcasm by {{comparing}} <b>Orrery</b> to a display of fireworks. It is overly bombastic in opinion because of its briefness. Were he able to write more and include more analytic evidence, this review might not be a bad source for negative criticism.|$|E

30|$|Simulating {{models of}} the {{physical}} world is instrumental in advancing scientific knowledge and developing technologies. Accordingly, the task has long been at the heart of science. For example, <b>orreries</b> have been used for millennia to simulate {{models of the}} motions of celestial objects [1]. More recently, differential analysers or mechanical integrators were developed to solve differential equations modelling e.g. heat flow and transmission lines [2, 3].|$|R

25|$|The Antikythera {{mechanism}} was an <b>orrery</b> and {{is claimed}} to be an early mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J. de Solla Price. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity {{comparable to that of}} the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his major}} {{victories}} in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of <b>Orrery,</b> Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in Cork to change sides and fight with the Parliament. At this point, word reached Cromwell that Charles II (son of Charles I) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the Covenanter regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from Youghal on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.|$|E
25|$|The Zamarons are {{the first}} to acknowledge, after {{learning}} of Larfleeze's role in banishing the <b>Orrery</b> of Archangel Invictus into another dimension, that the events like Sinestro becoming a Green Lantern once again, the fall of the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lanterns Central Battery being poisoned, the return of Invictus and the Reach invasion in Odym are no coincidence, a fact that was currently revealed to be the Guardians of the Universe doing as they try to bring about the rise of the Third Army.|$|E
