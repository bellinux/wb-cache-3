5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{execution}} of Joachim III, who had previously saved Theodore Svetoslav from Byzantine captivity, are not entirely clear. Historians Ivan Bozhilov and Vasil Gyuzelev speculate that the Patriarch was among the responsible dignitaries for a Mongol invasion in 1285, after which Theodore Svetoslav had to be sent a hostage in the Golden Horde. John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggests that the alleged treachery might {{be linked to the}} obscure period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. Others believe that the verdict was a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of the new emperor to seek personal retribution from those who he deemed responsible for the hardships of his youth. However, most agree that the actions of Theodore Svetoslav consolidated the shaken imperial authority and paved the way for his long and successful reign. Bulgaria prospered between 1300 and 1321; the Mongol interference was dealt with and the country even regained Bessarabia from the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness {{reminded him of his}} mortality and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} express a lower bound on <b>the</b> {{variance}} <b>of</b> parameters, <b>the</b> CRB [18] is given, which is used as the theoretical bound to evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> practical estimation methods in many papers [19, 20].

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> signals in Wigner Domain.

5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} the theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way}} that the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky, which are particularly studied in this book.|$|E

25|$|In Political Justice Godwin had {{acknowledged}} that {{an increase in}} the standard of living as he envisioned could cause population pressures, but he saw an obvious solution to avoiding distress: “project a change in the structure of human action, if not of human nature, specifically the eclipsing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for sex by the development of intellectual pleasures”. In the 1798 version of his essay, Malthus specifically rejected this possible change in human nature. In the second and subsequent editions, however, he wrote that widespread moral restraint, i.e., postponement of marriage and pre-nuptial celibacy (sexual abstinence), could reduce the tendency of a population to grow until distress was felt.".|$|E
25|$|Another {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> {{to ensure}} that money was well-spent in military matters was {{the institution of the}} deputy-in-the-field.

Unfortunately, these deputies often interfered with operational decisions and were generally considered more of a hindrance than a boon by the top commanders. The Duke of Marlborough was especially caustic about them, when he commanded the States Army during the War of Spanish Succession, but a deputy like Sicco van Goslinga sometimes rendered useful services during that campaign.|$|E
