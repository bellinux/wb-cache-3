McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} work , you get more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past". Contrarily, Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap." [...] Croshaw also states that the gameplay is [...] "infinitely stronger [...] in that it's merely bad." ...|$|E

[...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because that is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out.

2500|$|The Super Bowl {{controversy}} {{was also}} a subject of humor {{on all of the}} late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he [...] "was happy to see this thing happen... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS". The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a [...] "Department of Wardrobe Security" [...] to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions. On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction. Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener. Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting [...] "I wore them once, they were cute." [...] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation [...] "silly", commenting [...] "In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this." [...] Dean added [...] "I don't find it terribly shocking relative to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has {{a lot of other things}} they should be pursuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matson found {{valuable}} {{support in}} Vipassana meditation and extensive psychotherapy during these later decades. Both endeavors brought depth to poems about relationships. Equal in Desire (ManRoot, San Francisco, 1982 and 1983) also expanded the direct expression style into love poems, {{at the same}} time including awareness of gender and pro-feminist concerns. Hourglass (Seagull Press, Oakland, CA: 1987) is a series of eight-syllable line sonnets with rhyme and half-rhyme schemes, each with a creative process travelogue in prose. All the poems celebrate meditation and the relation of mind and body, along with struggles inherent in establishing a practice. These came as his meditation took hold and blossomed. After he began Crazy Child workshops, Matson discovered he was one of many who, on cracking {{open the door to the}} creative unconscious, was overwhelmed by floods of images. Chaotic first drafts were eventually shaped into Squish Boots (Broken Shadow Publications, Oakland, CA: 2002), concerned with childhood and core family issues. The process fit William Carlos Williams’ teaching, [...] "The beauty of writing is…the discovery of something you DON’T know, rather than the synthesis [...] repetition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> do already know. It's a jump forward into life, unknown future life…." [...] Emotional daring and openness helped this effort contribute to the voice of Chalcedony Songs (Minotaur Press, WA: 2007, 2009). These came as protest of one of Matson's female characters, in an unfinished story, who faked her orgasms. Chalcedony explores intricate layers of love and relationship in an open and easily involved manner. Matson stayed with the challenge. He wrote from a female perspective and let that voice expand. The style, added to the consciousness of Squish Boots, developed into Matson's most authentic voice to date. In the background resonates his learning from Ancient Greek Classics, William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Ranier Maria Rilke, Pablo Neruda and Rumi, as well as contemporary poets. The voice aided in making a flexible structure for a series of poems, War Allies, inspired by difficult political times toward the end of the 20th Century, by 9/11, and by the encroachment of marketing into our private lives. The collection is scheduled for production by Torean Horn Press of Sonoma, California, in 2018. These poems, along with Chalcedony and current work, indicate that the primitive heart is at the basis of Matson's effort. His poems evolve in a roughly straight line from Beat lyrics to direct expression to a deeper level of language, involving the primitive heart and limbic system. The short essay Being Present: Paleo Poetry came about with help from Marie Martin, painter and childhood friend, and from John Paige (formerly Ceely) who has remained an insightful advisor since 1964. The essay, under consideration by Ambush of San Francisco, delineates the term [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] precisely.|$|E
