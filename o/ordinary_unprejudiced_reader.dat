60|$|The {{most ardent}} and devoted of Swift's admirers could hardly find a juster {{criticism}} of the work. It should satisfy any <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> of the printed History as we now have it, and to that extent emphasize the authenticity.|$|R
60|$|And ridiculous as it {{may seem}} to the <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader,</b> this {{positive}} expression and conviction of Miss Clark, like all positive convictions, was not without its influence on the larger unimpanelled Grand Jury of One Horse Gulch, and, by reflection, at last on the impanelled jury itself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{publishers}} write"This book ... answers with clarity all the unsolved {{questions of}} human existence. The recognitions mediated {{with this book}} are so immense that they force the <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> to ponder, investigate and go forward. The Grail Message will appeal to any human being who is seeking to understand life, his or her place in Creation, {{and the source of}} oneâ€™s being." ...|$|R
6000|$|Have we not here, then, {{the guiding}} {{principle}} of moral education? Must we not infer {{that the system}} so beneficent in its effects during infancy and maturity, will be equally beneficent throughout youth? Can any one believe that the method which answers so well {{in the first and}} the last divisions of life, will not answer in the intermediate division? Is it not manifest that as [...] "ministers and interpreters of Nature" [...] it is the function of parents to see that their children habitually experience the true consequences of their conduct--the natural reactions: neither warding them off, nor intensifying them, nor putting artificial consequences in place of them? No <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> will hesitate in his assent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maxwell's hints are {{extremely}} valuable to me," [...] I continued, [...] "for they confirm my own methods, {{some of which}} I had to learn by tedious experience. If I had known, for instance, the folly of allowing everybody to quiz the psychic, I might have been spared many hours of tiresome sitting. Maxwell is, indeed, an ideal investigator--he has made a great advance in methods, and his conclusions, though tentative, are most suggestive. No <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> can finish his book, Metapsychical Phenomena, without feeling that its author is a brave and fearless writer, {{as well as a}} cautious and sane reasoner. His published experience throws a flood of light on mediums and their puzzling peculiarities." ...|$|R
6000|$|You will {{carefully}} observe, <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader,</b> {{that we use}} {{the word}} [...] "some" [...] in speaking of those people. We are very far from pitting the poor against the rich. We are bound to recognise the fact that amongst both classes there are gems of brightest lustre, irradiated by rays from the celestial sun, while in both there are also found qualities worthy of condemnation. But when we record {{the fact that some}} of the white senhoras looked with jealousy and scorn upon our sweet little Indian heroine, we ought to recognise the undeniable truth that they themselves, (so long as actuated by such a spirit), were beneath contempt--fit subjects only for pity.|$|R
6000|$|This critique, the justness {{of which}} was {{unfortunately}} lost on poor Catherine, {{brought them to the}} door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and the feelings of the discerning and <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs. Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. [...] "Ah, Mother! How do you do?" [...] said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand. [...] "Where did you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch. Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near." [...] And this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed that they both looked very ugly.|$|R
60|$|It is an {{established}} opinion amongst some men, {{that there are}} in the understanding certain INNATE PRINCIPLES; some primary notions, KOIVAI EVVOIAI, characters, as it were stamped upon the mind of man; which the soul receives in its very first being, and brings into the world with it. It would be sufficient to convince <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>readers</b> of the falseness of this supposition, if I should only show (as I hope I shall in the following parts of this Discourse) how men, barely by the use of their natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have, without the help of any innate impressions; and may arrive at certainty, without any such original notions or principles. For I imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the ideas of colours innate in a creature to whom God hath given sight, and a power to receive them by the eyes from external objects: and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths to the impressions of nature, and innate characters, when we may observe in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of {{them as if they were}} originally imprinted on the mind.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{deny that}} there is great force and an {{imposing}} verisimilitude {{in this and the}} preceding chapter, and much that demands silent thought and respectful attention. But still the great question presses on me:--'coming in a cloud'! What is the true import of this phrase? Has not God himself expounded it? To the Son of Man, the great Apostle assures us, all power is given in heaven and on earth. He became Providence,--that is, a Divine Power behind the cloudy veil of human agency and worldly events and incidents, controlling, disposing, and directing acts and events to the gradual unfolding and final consummation of the great scheme of Redemption; the casting forth of the evil and alien nature from man, and thus effecting the union of the creature with the Creator, of man with God, in and through the Son of Man, even the Son of God made manifest. Now can it be doubted by the attentive and <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> of St. Matthew, c. xxiv, that the Son of Man, in fact, came in the utter destruction and devastation of the Jewish Temple and State, during the period from Vespasian to Hadrian, both included; and is it a sufficient reason for our rejecting the teaching of Christ himself, of Christ glorified and in his kingly character, that his Apostles, who disclaim all certain knowledge of the awful event, had understood his words otherwise, and in a sense more commensurate with their previous notions and the prejudices of their education? They communicated their conjectures, but as conjectures, and these too guarded by the avowal, that they had no revelation, no revealed commentary on their Master's words, upon this occasion, the great apocalypse of Jesus Christ while yet in the flesh. For by this title was this great prophecy known among the Christians of the Apostolic age.|$|R
60|$|So {{the letters}} would run on for sheets upon sheets, in the closest cramped handwriting; and I leave any <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader</b> {{to say whether}} the writer of such {{documents}} must not have been as silly and vain a creature as ever lived, and whether {{she did not want}} being taken care of? I could copy out yards of rhapsody to Lord George Poynings, her old flame, in which she addressed him by the most affectionate names, and implored him to find a refuge for her against her oppressors; but they would fatigue the reader to peruse, as they would me to copy. The fact is, that this unlucky lady had the knack of writing a great deal more than she meant. She was always reading novels and trash; putting herself into imaginary characters and flying off into heroics and sentimentalities with as little heart as any woman I ever knew; yet showing the most violent disposition to be in love. She wrote always as if she was in a flame of passion. I have an elegy on her lap-dog, the most tender and pathetic piece she ever wrote; and most tender notes of remonstrance to Betty, her favourite maid; to her housekeeper, on quarrelling with her; to half-a-dozen acquaintances, each of whom she addressed as the dearest friend in the world, and forgot the very moment she took up another fancy. As for her love for her children, the above passage will show how much she was capable of true maternal feeling: the very sentence in which she records the death of one child serves to betray her egotisms, and to wreak her spleen against myself; and she only wishes to recall another from the grave, in order that he may be of some personal advantage to her. If I DID deal severely with this woman, keeping her from her flatterers who would have bred discord between us, and locking her up out of mischief, who shall say that I was wrong? If any woman deserved a strait-waistcoat,--it was my Lady Lyndon; and I have known people in my time manacled, and with their heads shaved, in the straw, who had not committed half the follies of that foolish, vain, infatuated creature.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{these are}} only two out {{of a number of}} cases that I have seen myself, in which a similar {{explanation}} of his cure has been given to me by the person cured, and I would like to ask the <b>unprejudiced</b> and open-minded <b>reader</b> how he explains them. Personally I cannot explain them except upon an hypothesis which, as a practical person, I confess I hesitate to adopt. I mean that of a direct interposition from above, or of the working of something so unrecognized or so undefined in the nature of man (which it will be remembered the old Egyptians, a very wise people, divided into many component parts, whereof we have now lost count), that it may be designated an innate superior power or principle, brought into action by faith or 'suggestion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Fables" [...] of Dryden are {{the best}} {{examples}} of his talents as a narrative poet; those powers of composition, description, and narration, which must have been called into exercise by the Epic Muse, had his fate allowed him to enlist among her votaries. The [...] "Knight's Tale," [...] the longest and most laboured of Chaucer's stories, possesses a degree of regularity which might satisfy the most severe critic. It is true, that the honour arising from thence must be assigned to the more ancient bard, who had himself drawn his subject from an Italian model; but the high and decided preference which Dryden has given to this story, although somewhat censured by Trapp, enables us to judge how much the poet held an accurate combination of parts, and coherence of narrative, essentials of epic poetry.[10] That a classic scholar like Trapp should think the plan of the [...] "Knight's Tale" [...] equal to that of the Iliad, is a degree of candour not to be hoped for; but surely to an <b>unprejudiced</b> <b>reader,</b> a story which exhausts in its conclusion all the interest which it has excited in its progress, which, when terminated, leaves no question to be asked, no personage undisposed of, and no curiosity unsatisfied, is, abstractedly considered, more gratifying than the history of a few weeks of a ten years' war, commencing long after the siege had begun, and ending long before the city was taken. Of the other tales, it can hardly be said that their texture is more ingenious or closely woven than that of ordinary novels or fables: but in each of them Dryden has displayed the superiority of his genius, in selecting for amplification and ornament those passages most susceptible of poetical description. The account of the procession of the Fairy Chivalry in the [...] "Flower and the Leaf;" [...] the splendid description of the champions who came to assist at the tournament in the [...] "Knight's Tale;" [...] the account of the battle itself, its alternations and issue,--if they cannot be called improvements on Chaucer, are nevertheless so spirited a transfusion of his ideas into modern verse, as almost to claim the merit of originality. Many passages might be shown in which this praise may be carried still higher, and the merit of invention added to that of imitation. Such is the description of the commencement of the tourney, which is almost entirely original, and most of the ornaments in the translations from Boccacio, whose prose fictions demanded more additions from the poet than the exuberant imagery of Chaucer. To select instances would be endless; but every reader of poetry has by heart the description of Iphigenia asleep, nor are the lines in [...] "Theodore and Honoria,"[11] which describe the approach of the apparition, and its effects upon animated and inanimated nature even before it becomes visible, less eminent for beauties of the terrific order: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{point of}} style and artistic effect, the {{different}} parts of the Qur'an are of very unequal value. An <b>unprejudiced</b> and critical <b>reader</b> will certainly find very few passages where his aesthetic susceptibilities are thoroughly satisfied. But he will often be struck, especially in the older pieces, by a wild force of passion, and a vigorous, if not rich, imagination. Descriptions of heaven and hell, and allusions to God's working in Nature, not infrequently show a certain amount of poetic power. In other places also the style is sometimes lively and impressive, though it is rare indeed that we come across such strains of touching simplicity as in the middle of xciii. The greater part of the Qur'an's message is decidedly prosaic; and so indeed is its style. Of course, with such a variety of material, we cannot expect every part to be equally vivacious, or imaginative, or poetic. A decree about the right of inheritance, or point of ritual, must necessarily be expressed in prose, {{if it is to be}} intelligible. No one complains of the civil laws in Exodus or the sacrificial ritual in Leviticus because they want the fire of Isaiah or the tenderness of Deuteronomy. But Muhammad's mistake consists in persistent and slavish adherence to the semi-poetic form which he had at first adopted in accordance with his own taste and that of his hearers. For instance, he employs rhyme in dealing with the most prosaic subjects, and thus produces the disagreeable effect of incongruity between style and matter." ...|$|R
