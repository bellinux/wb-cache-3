50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an <b>oil</b> <b>sealed</b> rotary vane <b>pump</b> (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented to}} predict the oil film thickness in an axial sealing contact based on grease properties and operating conditions. It is assumed that {{a small amount of}} grease will form an oil reservoir on the rotating part and slowly supply <b>oil</b> to the <b>sealing</b> contact. The <b>oil</b> bleed model from a previous study is implemented and oil loss due to centrifugal forces and the <b>seal</b> <b>pumping</b> action are taken into account. The results show that, depending on the operating conditions, an oil film is present in the sealing contact for a certain period of time. The oil film thickness decreases in time due to the decreasing oil supply from the grease reservoir and oil loss from the contact due to centrifugal forces. <b>Seal</b> <b>pumping</b> has only a small effect and the seal material and geometry are therefore not important for the predicted time until the mixed lubrication regime is reached. This time depends on the oil viscosity, rotational speed, and seal contact radius and scales with the η /(n 2 ·ds) parameter.

40|$|Gas foil {{bearings}} offer {{several advantages}} over traditional bearing types {{that make them}} attractive for use in high-speed turbomachinery. They can operate at very high temperatures, require no lubrication supply (<b>oil</b> <b>pumps,</b> <b>seals,</b> etc.), exhibit very long life with no maintenance, and once operating airborne, have very low power loss. The use of gas foil bearings in high-speed turbomachinery has been accelerating in recent years, although the pace has been slow. One of the contributing factors to the slow growth has been a lack of analysis tools, benchmarked to measurements, to predict gas foil bearing behavior in rotating machinery. To address this shortcoming, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has supported the development of analytical tools to predict gas foil bearing performance. One of the codes has the capability to predict rotordynamic coefficients, power loss, film thickness, structural deformation, and more. The current paper presents {{an assessment of the}} predictive capability of the code, named XLGFBTH (Texas A&M University). A test rig at GRC is used as a simulated case study to compare rotordynamic analysis using output from the code to actual rotor response as measured in the test rig. The test rig rotor is supported on two gas foil journal bearings manufactured at GRC, with all pertinent geometry disclosed. The resulting comparison shows that the rotordynamic coefficients calculated using XLGFBTH represent the dynamics of the system reasonably well, especially as they pertain to predicting critical speeds...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The {{cause and}} effects of a large subsynchronous {{vibration}} (3. 5 mils at 3490 cpm) in an FCC wet gas compressor are examined. The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the balance piston and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils. The rotordynarnic analysis also identified other modifications to the bearing and balance piston design that should be made to increase the rotor's margin of stability. Both steady-state and transient spectral vibration data are provided before and after the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> modification to validate the rotordynarnic model of the compressor...|$|R
40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or recesses as part of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land grooves in an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

[...] MTT assay showed that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> induced cell death and enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The IC₅₀ values of paclitaxel in MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were reduced 3. 3 - and 2. 4 -fold, respectively, by the inclusion of 0. 016 % <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Morphological assessment and DNA strand break assay indicated that more cells treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> underwent apoptosis than that with paclitaxel alone treatment. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> alone was also found to induce apoptosis in both cell lines. Western blot showed that the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Bcl- 2 protein in both cell lines was down-regulated by <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and was inhibited further when cells were treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> GC assay determined that the total PUFAs increased significantly in the intracellular lipid composition following incubation with <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> which may be responsible for the increased lipid peroxides found in cells incubated under the same conditions. [...] In addition to <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> Intralipid®, which is a soybean oil emulsion mainly containing ω- 6 PUFAs, was also studied for its cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction.

[...] In conclusion, <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was found to induce apoptosis, and to enhance the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in both breast cancer cell lines, which may be due to its ability to down-regulate the expression of Bcl- 2 protein and to produce lipid peroxides.
