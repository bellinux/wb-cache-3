30|$|A further {{question}} that has emerged in LSP ‘strong’ BUPLAS CA assessment processes has been the number of calls to be assessed to make a QA assessment.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) declined by an average of 24. 5 + 14. 3 [*]mmHg and 12. 6 + 9. 1 [*]mmHg, respectively. BP responder rates defined as attaining BP < 140 / 90 [*]mmHg were significantly (P< 0. 001) and substantially higher among younger patients, nonpostmenopausal women, and patients receiving monotherapy.

This study is the rst to characterise the landform assemblages within Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand, and develop {{a model for the}} post-glacial evolution of the valley. In particular, it assesses the origins of hummocky topography on the valley oor which, like in many other parts of the world, have previously been interpreted to be glacial in origin. Geomorphic eld mapping, GPR, sedimentology (clast and agglomerate identi cation), and a novel terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND) method of extracting meteoric 10 Be from pyroxene minerals were utilised to reconstruct the geomorphology of the valley during the Holocene. Glacial deposits were con rmed at Knobs Flat and Eglinton Flat while RA deposits were conclusively found at Knobs Flat, Deer Flat, and adjacent to Lake Malvora. Eglinton Valley has been completely blocked <b>on</b> (<b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>of)</b> <b>three</b> separate occasions, forming a large lake each time, with only Lake Gunn and a few minor swamps and lakes (e. g. Lake Malvora) remaining today. Relative age dating evidence suggests the rst lake was formed by the large Deer Flat RA, the next formed due to the extensiveWesney Creek alluvial fan, and the youngest, Lake Gunn, {{as a result of the}} Lake Gunn Landslide ~ 7. 6 kyrs BP. TCND was uncompleted due to lab contamination at the nal step, however, the methods attempted here appeared to yield promising results. The Eglinton Valley has been sculpted by glacial, mass movement, and uvial processes. This work advances the knowledge of the processes responsible for the hummocky terrain found throughout Eglinton Valley, and adds to the currently limited pool of research into the reinterpretation of hummocky deposits within deglaciated valleys in a global and New Zealand context...|$|E
40|$|Aims. Multiwavelength {{observations}} of the young massive cluster Westerlund 1 have revealed evidence for {{a large number of}} OB supergiant and Wolf-Rayet binaries. However, in most cases these findings are based on the detection of secondary binary characteristics, such as hard X-ray emission and/or non-thermal radio spectra and hence provide little information on binary properties such as mass ratio and orbital period. To overcome this shortcoming we have initiated a long temporal baseline, multi-epoch radial velocity survey that will provide the first direct constraints on these parameters. Methods. VLT/FLAMES+GIRAFFE {{observations of}} Wd 1 were made on seven epochs from late-June to early-September 2008, covering ~ 35 confirmed members of Wd 1 and ~ 70 photometrically-selected candidate members. Each target was observed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> epochs, with brighter cluster members observed on five (or, in a few cases, seven) occasions. Individual spectra cover the 8484 – 9001 Å range, and strong Paschen-series absorption lines are used to measure radial velocity changes in order to identify candidate binary systems for follow-up study. Results. This study presents first-epoch results from twenty of the most luminous supergiant stars in Wd 1. Four new OB supergiant members of Wd 1 are identified, while statistically significant radial velocity changes are detected in ~ 60 % of the targets. W 43 a is identified as a short-period binary, while W 234 and the newly-identified cluster member W 3003 are probable binaries and W 2 a is a strong binary candidate. The cool hypergiants W 243 and W 265 display photospheric pulsations, while a number of early-mid B supergiants display significant radial velocity changes of ~ 15 – 25 km s - 1 that we cannot distinguish between orbital or photospheric motion in our initial short-baseline survey. When combined with existing observations, we find 30 % of our sample to be binary (6 / 20) while additional candidate binaries support a binary fraction amongst Wd 1 supergiants in excess of ~ 40 %, a figure that is likely to increase as further data become available...|$|E

Twenty-two elders who spent 60 minutes or more awake during the night <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> nights per week for at least six months received treatment. The study utilized an experimental design with repeated measures. The subjects were randomly assigned to either an immediate or delayed (waiting list control) treatment group. Subjects completed daily sleep diaries and several other measures. The behavioral intervention was a treatment package consisting of sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control instructions, sleep education, and an optional daytime nap. A six-week treatment program consisting of four weekly classes and two weekly telephone interventions was implemented. Between and within group differences were identified using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc analyses were performed to identify significant differences. The between group analysis of sleep behaviors revealed an improvement in wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency for the immediate treatment group. After intervention, the delayed treatment group improved on the same sleep behaviors as well as total sleep time. The therapeutic improvement was maintained at the three month follow-up. Sleep-wake impairment, dysfunctional cognitions, and presleep anxiety were reduced for both groups. The mood measures indicated that the subjects were not depressed prior to treatment and remained nondepressed following intervention. State and trait anxiety levels decreased. Favorable ratings for therapy evaluation were received. The majority of subjects felt they were compliant with treatment and had corresponding decreases in wake after sleep onset. In addition to statistical significance, the clinical significance of the study was established. Insomnia in older adults can be effectively treated using nonpharmacological intervention. Replication of the study is warranted as well as analysis to examine moderating factors affecting treatment outcomes. An effort should be made to increase the demographic diversity of subjects in future studies.

40|$|Background Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (MTBI) is frequent and sometimes leads to persistent disability. It remains a matter of controversy as to what impact the different main determinants - brain injury factors and psychosocial factors - exert {{on the development of}} postconcussional disorder (PCD). Aims, subjects and methods The overall aim was to find predictors for PCD after MTBI. One hundred and twenty-two persons with MTBI were assessed with CT and MRI brain scans, S 100 B, S 100 A 1 B, and clinical variables. The first week after the trauma an extended assessment was performed, including previous history of psychiatric disorder, psychological function the year before the trauma, personality, coping ability, and concurrent psychosocial streamers. Three months post injury outcome was assessed by use of self assessment questionnaires for MTBI symptoms and disability. Cognitive impairment was assessed with a computerized Automated Psychology Test (APT) and neuropsychological testing. Thirtyfive healthy control persons were assessed for comparison. Results Is increased S 100 associated with cognitive impairment? S 100 B and S 100 A 1 B were increased in 42 % and 64 % of the patients. Cognitive impairment was found in 8 % when assessed with APT and in 30 % when assessed with neuropsychological tests. No significant correlation was found between S 100 B or S 100 A 1 B and cognitive impairment, nor between subjectively reported cognitive dysfunction and test performance, regardless of the method used. What is the clinical course after MTBI? At least one persisting symptom was reported by 49 % of the patients at three months - most commonly poor memory, sleeping problems and fatigue. High symptom load at day one correlated with high symptom load and disability at three months, when 25 % also reported disability in at least one domain of everyday life. How should PCD be defined? The ICD- 10 definition of PCD was considered too liberal as no disability was required. Sixteen % of control subjects were considered "cognitive impairment cases" as compared to 28 % in the MTBI group. The results from neuropsychological testing had insufficient specificity to qualify, as proposed in the DSM-IV, as a defining property of PCD. A definition of PCD based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> symptoms and two domains of disability at three months post injury was proposed, which yielded 17 % PCD cases in the whole sample. Which risk factors predict the development of PCD? Preinjury psychological vulnerability (previous psychiatric disorder, trait anxiety, embitterment), lower preinjury psychological function (GAF) and concurrent psychosocial stressors were significant predictors of PCD. Posttraumatic stress (hyperarousal) one week after the MTBI had the highest impact on the outcome. Female gender and concurrent medical condition were also correlated to PCD, but no correlation was found between PCD and injury related factor. Summary Signs of brain injury or brain dysfunction are present in the early phase after MTBI but show poor correlation to PCD as defined by at least three symptoms in combination with disability at three months post injury. The results from neuropsychological testing had insufficient specificity to qualify as a defining property of PCD. Prognosis after MTBI is good in most cases, but a minority of patients develop PCD, which emerges {{as a result of the}} interaction between premorbid psychological vulnerability, brain dysfunction in the early phase, posttraumatic hyperarousal and concurrent psychosocial stressors.

40|$|Government policy {{requires}} that valuable resources should be recovered and recycled from biodegradable waste. A successful and growing organics recycling industry delivers this policy with composting {{being one of}} the principal technologies deployed to process suitable feedstock such as garden and food waste. Composting inevitably generates bioaerosols – particulate matter comprising cells or cellular components that are released into the air as a result of disturbance of composting feedstock or the processing of final product. Exposure to bioaerosols {{has the potential to be}} harmful to human and animal health. The Environment Agency adopts a precautionary and risk-based approach to the regulation of composting facilities which was developed on the basis of research by Wheeler et al. (2001) and which has been updated as new evidence has become available. The Environment Agency also requires site operators to monitor bioaerosols around their facilities using methods specified in a standard protocol which relies upon classical microbiology methods which are tried and tested but which are labour-intensive, slow and offer only a snapshot view of a highly dynamic system. A recent IOM review commissioned by Defra (Searl, 2009) on exposure-response relationships for bioaerosol emissions from waste treatment processes identified significant gaps in knowledge of exposure to bioaerosols and recommended that more research was needed into alternatives to viable microbial monitoring such as priority biomarkers (notably endotoxin) and potential surrogates such as particulate matter. The IOM review also concluded that there is a lack of information to support the development of appropriate stand-off distances. The overall aim of this project was to provide evidence on bioaerosol production, dispersion and potential exposures from composting facilities in support of future developments in policy and regulation of biowaste facilities. The objectives were: (i) to undertake a comprehensive set of standard and novel bioaerosol measurements at representative composting sites to assess comparability between different methods and also to measure spatial and temporal variations; and (ii) to determine the odour emissions and then compare these with bioaerosol emissions to see if odour is a marker of significant bioaerosol exposure. Standard (AfOR, 2009) and novel (CEN filter method, endotoxin, glucan, qPCR, real-time particulates) bioaerosols measurements were taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to a maximum of six occasions over a twelve month period at four different composting facilities in England. The composting facilities were selected to represent sites of varying sizes (tonnages) and to allow a comparison of bioaerosol concentrations at standard open windrow sites versus a fully-contained site. Additional supporting information was collected including meteorological data at the time of sampling, observation of site operations and measurements of odour at one of the sites. Supporting bioaerosol and odour dispersion modelling was conducted at the site where the odour measurements were made. The spatial trend of bioaerosol concentrations described by Wheeler et al., (1991) and upon which EA regulatory policy is based was broadly corroborated by this dataset. Excursions above the EA acceptable levels at or beyond 250 m from source were rare. Bioaerosol concentrations at the enclosed site were generally lower than at the open windrow sites. There was no evidence of a seasonal pattern in bioaerosol concentrations at any of the sites whereas between-sampling day variations were apparent. The cause(s) of these variations were not identified. No consistent relationship was observed between the concentration of bioaerosols measured by the two AfOR standard methods. The two methods displayed certain strengths and weakness in different situations. The IOM sampling device proved to be better suited to situations where high bioaerosol concentrations were encountered (close to source); the Andersen proving to be more effective in the lower concentration range typically found upwind of a site or at distance downwind from source. The higher volume filtration device tested in this project (referred to as the CEN method) produced data that did not consistently match either of the AfOR standard methods. This device demonstrated greater sensitivity than the IOM filter method but suffered drawbacks associated with its weight and a lack of ease of use in the field. Endotoxin concentrations were normally below the level recommended by the Dutch Expert Committee on Occupational Safety but occasional exceedances of this standard were detected at the larger open windrow sites. The majority of glucan measurements were below a widely referred to 10 ng/m 3 threshold. Significantly elevated concentrations were detected at one of the larger open windrow sites. The dynamic range of the qPCR method is wider (4 - 5 -log) than either of the AfOR and the CEN methods. It is also quicker to carry out and has the potential for automation. The results from the qPCR method are mainly higher than standard AfOR methods, as the method does not distinguish viable and non-viable spores. The spatial distribution of Aspergillus fumigatus spores (by qPCR) along sampling transects, gives similar results compared to AfOR (and CEN) methods. Real time particle detection showed that both TSP and PM 10 are correlated to Aspergillus fumigatus spore concentration. No consistent relationship was observed between odour and bioaerosol concentrations (although this was a limited dataset). The envelope of modelled (back-extrapolated) bioaerosol emission rates straddles several orders of magnitude. Distinguishing the influences of meteorological conditions on this variability was not possible. It was not possible to predict bioaerosol or odour emission rates with confidence. This continues to hamper confidence in modelling of odours and bioaerosols from open windrow facilities. The findings of this research have implications for the current standard monitoring protocol which should be reviewed accordingly. The findings of this multi-site survey accord with existing regulatory policy and are supportive of the general trend towards enclosed facilities. Notwithstanding this, continuing research is needed to enhance the database on emission from bioaerosol and odour abatement technologies (e. g. biofilters); to determine the cause(s) of occasional bioaerosol peaks from open facilities; to improve exposure assessments through better modelling protocols; and to link enhanced exposure information to future health impact studies...|$|E
