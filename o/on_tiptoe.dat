In the scene that follows No. 14 ("Things are seldom what they seem"), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord's dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet, eliciting the response [...] "Crushed again!" [...] Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in Patience. Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 ("Carefully <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe</b> stealing") and again after No. 19 ("Farewell, my own").|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the curved}} design, the blades {{have to be}} {{slightly}} longer than a runner's biological leg and foot would be. The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride, so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe.</b> They are designed to move forward, so have no heel support in the back. According to Josh McHugh of Wired Magazine, [...] "The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord. It’s impossible to stand still on them, and difficult to move slowly. Once they get going, Cheetahs are extremely hard to control." ...|$|E

The series also has many of the cast members from other Modiri works such as Noghtechin, and Jayezeye Bozorg. In <b>On</b> <b>Tiptoes</b> Modiri plays the role of Farhad, and Shir Farhad(Farhad's father). In Shabhaye Barareh, Modiri is playing the younger version of Shir Farhad. Shabhaye Barareh also features Toghrol, showing him to have had a military career in his youth, hence his strict behaviour and attitude.|$|R
500|$|The {{critical}} {{importance of the}} feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, [...] "no foot, no horse". The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, {{the equivalent of the}} human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. The end result is that a horse, weighing on average , travels on the same bones as would a human <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe.</b> For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks, though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.|$|E
500|$|Some bowlers had {{experimented with}} Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1–0 {{down in the}} series and {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense." [...] He went right back to the bouncers, standing <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe,</b> and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. Wisden described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it [...] "probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing." [...] He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies' second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn. However, this performance played a large part in turning English opinion against Bodyline. The Times used the word [...] "Bodyline", without using inverted commas or using the qualification [...] "so-called", for the first time. Wisden said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{himself had}} to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at Old Trafford, Jackie Grant, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He {{had a couple of}} fast bowlers, Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he {{recovered}} to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense." [...] He played right back to the bouncers, standing <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe,</b> and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. The Times used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification so-called, for the first time. Wisden also said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pipa is {{commonly}} associated with [...] Princess Liu Xijun and Wang Zhaojun of the Han dynasty, although the form of pipa they played in that period {{is unlikely to be}} pear-shaped as they are now usually depicted. [...] Other early known players of pipa include General Xie Shang (謝尚) from the Jin Dynasty who was described to have performed playing it <b>on</b> <b>tiptoe.</b> The introduction of pipa from Central Asia also brought with it virtuoso performers from that region, for example Sujiva (蘇祇婆) from the Kingdom of Kucha during the Northern Zhou Dynasty, Kang Kunlun (康崑崙) from Kangju, and Pei Luoer (裴洛兒) from Shule. [...] Pei Luoer was known for pioneering finger-playing techniques, while Sujiva was noted for the [...] "Seven modes and seven tones", a musical modal theory from India. (The heptatonic scale was used for a time afterwards in the imperial court due to Sujiva's influence until it was later abandoned). [...] These players had considerable influence on the development of pipa playing in China. Of particular fame were the family of pipa players founded by Cao Poluomen (曹婆羅門) and who were active for many generations from the Northern Wei to Tang Dynasty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{to what extent the}} effects of motor imagery on postural sway are constrained by movement features and the subject’s imagery ability. Twenty-three subjects were asked to imagine three movements using the kinesthetic modality: rising <b>on</b> <b>tiptoes,</b> whole-body forward reaching, and whole-body lateral reaching. After each task, subjects reported the level of imagery vividness and were subsequently grouped into a HIGH group (scores ≥ 3, moderately intense imagery) or a LOW group (scores ≤ 2, mildly intense imagery). An eyes closed trial was used as a control task. Center of gravity (COG) coordinates were collected, along with surface EMG of the deltoid (medial and anterior portion) and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. COG variability was quantified as the amount of fluctuations in position and velocity in the forward-backward and lateral directions. Changes in COG variability during motor imagery were observed only for the HIGH group. COG variability in the forward-backward direction was increased during the rising <b>on</b> <b>tiptoes</b> imagery, compared with the control task (p= 0. 01) and the lateral reaching imagery (p= 0. 02). Conversely, COG variability in the lateral direction was higher in rising <b>on</b> <b>tiptoes</b> and lateral reaching imagery than during the control task (p 0. 08) or task (p> 0. 46) for any of the tested muscles. In summary, motor imagery influences body sway dynamics in a task-dependent manner, and relies on the subject’ imagery ability. <br/...|$|R
