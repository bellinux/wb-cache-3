5|$|Commercial <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> remunerated {{activities}} which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example {{of this type of}} operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, crop spraying, and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Operation</b> Jacana <b>is</b> the codename for {{a series}} of {{operations}} carried out by coalition forces in Afghanistan. The <b>operations</b> <b>were</b> carried out most notably by 45 Commando Royal Marines. U.S. forces, Australian SAS and Norwegian FSK also participated. The <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> a follow-up <b>operation</b> of <b>Operation</b> Anaconda and <b>was</b> meant to kill or capture the remaining Al-Qaida and Taliban rebels.

5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E
5|$|Fluor is {{the largest}} {{construction}} and engineering company in the Fortune 500 and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall. It has offices in 25 countries.

About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011. The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Polish Foreign Ministry {{asked the}} {{government}} of Russia about alleged footage of the massacre filmed by the NKVD during the killings, something the Russians have denied exists.

50|$|The cost of <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> the {{business}} strategy implemented in many companies {{to gain a}} huge market.

5|$|No <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> {{reported}} in Sicily {{for the first}} two years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E
5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
50|$|An <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> atomic if {{the system}} is left in a {{consistent}} state even if the <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> interrupted.
