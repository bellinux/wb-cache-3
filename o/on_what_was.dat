Local excavations revealed remains of a Roman amphitheatre near Ludgate <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> Fleet Prison, but other accounts suggest the area was too marshy for regular inhabitation by the Romans. The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west around what is now Aldwych and the Strand.|$|E

The new material was recorded with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmie Lee Sloas in October 2003. The project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth's eight-album back catalog on Capitol Records, re-recording portions that were missing or altered without his knowledge in the original mixing.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then the northern boundary of the built-up area. Other main line termini soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the built-up area, making them inconvenient to reach.|$|E

It was named for him {{in honor of his}} role emancipating the district's slaves. The school was closed in 1956 due to its small size, and shortly thereafter converted to the Morgan Annex, a satellite location of the adjacent Thomas P. Morgan School. The Morgan Annex was later closed; it was sold in 1989, and then reopened as the Morgan Annex Lofts condominiums.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> Route 11N, a remnant of Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.|$|E
5|$|MD234 {{originally}} followed {{what is now}} MD238 from Chaptico east to MD5 at Helen. The ChapticoLeonardtown {{portion of}} the highway was then designated as part of MD237. The original MD234 was constructed in the early 1920s; MD237 {{was built in the}} late 1920s and early 1930s. MD237 between Clements and Leonardtown was reconstructed around 1950. The ChapticoClements section of MD237 and MD234 west of Chaptico were rebuilt around 1960, projects that involved many relocations and several new bridges. At the conclusion of the project in 1961, MD234 was extended east over the former section of MD237 to Leonardtown; MD238 was extended from Chaptico to Helen <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> previously MD234.|$|E

Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a progressive metal album similar to Matheos' work in Fates Warning, however Moore's impact changed the music's direction and genre, incorporating electronica into the original progressive metal sound. The band's debut album was released by InsideOut Music in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{science of}} the Middle Ages had a {{considerable}} influence <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes. One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Planché's {{personal}} life inspired two works.

5|$|Some Neolithic flint tools {{recovered}} {{from the top of}} the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since prehistory.
