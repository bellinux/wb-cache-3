25|$|The Kingdom of Lithuania was a {{short-lived}} constitutional monarchy created {{towards the end}} of World War I when Lithuania was under occupation by the German Empire. The Council of Lithuania declared Lithuania's independence on February 16, 1918, but the Council was unable to form a government, police, or <b>other</b> <b>state</b> <b>institutions</b> due to the continued presence of German troops. The Germans presented various proposals to incorporate Lithuania into the German Empire, particularly Prussia. The Lithuanians resisted this idea and hoped to preserve their independence by creating a separate constitutional monarchy. On June 4, 1918, they voted to offer the Lithuanian throne to the German noble Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach. Duke Wilhelm accepted the offer in July 1918 and took the name Mindaugas II. However, he never visited Lithuania. His election stirred up controversy, divided the Council, and did not achieve the desired results. As Germany was losing the war and was engulfed in the German Revolution, Lithuania suspended its decision to invite Duke William on November 2, 1918, thereby ending his short reign.|$|E

40|$|As {{national}} {{focus on}} retention and student success increases, many <b>states</b> and <b>institutions</b> {{are looking for}} ways to increase the number of students who ultimately earn degrees. Many are realizing that the non-traditional adult student population is a historically untapped demographic that can provide almost instant, positive changes in graduation rates. This group is often considered low-hanging fruit and can be targeted to quickly complete unfinished degrees. This is especially true for institutions that have a large number of non-completers with high numbers of earned hours. Many non-returners have 90 or more earned hours and simply need some encouragement and proper guidance to start down the path to degree completion. In West Virginia, as in many <b>other</b> <b>states,</b> <b>institutions</b> have recently increased their focus on student retention and success. One of the outcomes of this increased focus was the creation in 2011 of the statewide DegreeNow program to encourage degree completion by adults with previously earned college credit.

In fact, the amended Constitution does not yet specified the characteristics of the presidential system of government, so there is awareness that a reconstruction into the presidential system of government is needed. Since 1945 independence until transition period, presidential system of government based on 1945 Constitution was conducted inconsistently because 1945 Constitution was arbitrarily interpreted by the presidents in their terms of office. Theoretically, there was a new concept on the presidential system of government, that is the pure presidential system of government.
