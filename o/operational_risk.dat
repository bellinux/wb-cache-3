5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. <b>Operational</b> <b>risk</b> characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, <b>operational</b> <b>risk,</b> and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as <b>operational</b> <b>risk,</b> internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{is a very}} important concept for any business as most financial decisions revolve around the corporate cost of holding risk. This issue is particularly important to banks since risk constitutes their core business processes. This study assesses the risk profile of GCB to ascertain its soundness and conformity to international best practices. The study selects credit, liquidity, market and <b>operational</b> <b>risks</b> as dependent variables while size, NPLs ratio, capital adequacy and asset management are utilized as explanatory variables for the period of five years from 2007 to 2011. The regression results indicate that the size of bank does not influence any of the risks. Apart from credit risk which is influenced positively by the NPL ratio, all the other risks, show a negative relationship with NPL ratio. The capital adequacy has a negative relationship with credit and liquidity but a positive relationship with market and <b>operational</b> <b>risks.</b> Both debt-equity ratio and asset management establish a positive relationship with credit and <b>operational</b> <b>risks,</b> but a negative relationship with liquidity and market risks. Generally, the study revealed that GCB has a good risk profile in the face of challenging global economic and business environment. The Bank had adequate risk management structures to ensure sound management of financial and <b>operational</b> <b>risks.</b> These structures were also in line with internationally accepted principles for managing risks.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of the author`s wider {{research}} that examines the impact of <b>operational</b> <b>risks</b> on the functioning of financial organisations, with particular reference to central banks. The research clearly demonstrates the importance of the human factor in the timely identification and efficient management of <b>operational</b> <b>risks.</b> People are the basic strength of organisations; they are the source of innovation, as well as of good relations with customers and other interested parties. The paper highlights the illusion that people can be successful in improving products or providing better services without improving themselves as well. Any assessment of the impact of the human factor on the appearance, identification, and efficient management of <b>operational</b> <b>risks</b> is a very complex process. This has to be an ongoing process that develops through the development of the organisation, staff competences and motivation, as well as organisational culture. In particular, emphasis must be placed on the importance of learning and knowledge in both the recognition and the efficient management of <b>operational</b> <b>risks.</b> The paper identifies education as the foundation of knowledge and knowledge as the foundation of the long-term development of organisations. They grow in significance when employing a process approach to risk management, especially the connected roles of ?process owners? and ?risk owners? in effective process and risk management. It is also clearly shown that any defence against risk, is as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest link in the chain of defence is an untrained, demotivated or dissatisfied employee or team, who are unable to recognize risk on time...|$|R
