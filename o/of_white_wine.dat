5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

25|$|Bordeaux {{used to have}} a {{significant}} production of white wines, with Entre-deux-Mers, a primarily white wine area. Unlike the style of dry white Bordeaux favoured today, with almost 100% Sauvignon Blanc and a heavy influence of new oak, the traditional Entre-deux-Mers whites had a high proportion of Semillion and were made in either old oak barrels or steel tanks. Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, these vineyards were converted to red wine production (of Bordeaux AOC and Bordeaux Supérieur AOC), and the production <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> has decreased ever since. Today production <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> has shrunk to about one tenth of Bordeaux's total production, with 11.0% of the vineyard surface in 2007 used for white wines (7.8% for dry, 3.2% for sweet).|$|E

25|$|Because of its shorter maceration, {{white wine}} {{contains}} very little tannin and therefore little antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking.

25|$|The {{dry white}} wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar ratio is {{generally}} less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine very difficult to develop because {{the balance of the}} wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol.

25|$|Since the Middle Ages {{white wine}} has {{inspired}} many painters to include it in still lifes {{or for the}} representation of the everyday life, party life, or life to excess.

25|$|The use of oak {{in white}} wine has {{declined}} significantly {{in recent times}} when before the norm was traditionally 2–5 years in oak.

Today the focus <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> makers has been to enhance the vibrancy and fruit flavors of the wine.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E

25|$|In the Mediterranean basin the Crusades greatly enriched both rival {{republics of}} Venice and Genoa.

Once back home, the rulers and wealthy aristocrats looking to buy the sweet wines they enjoyed in the East. They came from grapes that dominated the vineyards of Languedoc-Roussillon and Spain. Trade in these wines was facilitated by their high alcohol content which ensured preservation during the long journey to Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> {{dry white wine}} is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and tangy, it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of Noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
