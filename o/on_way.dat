5|$|In 1695 the French command {{found that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war contributions and started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance. During the winter of 1694-1695, the inhabitants of Calella repelled a punishment force of 800 or 1,000 French soldiers from the Blanes garrison and killed between 60 or 100 of them. French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces, the miquelets, who laid ambushes to Noailles' forces from woods and heights. One of the most effective leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer of Vic, who achieved two victories over the French during the winter: on late December he overran a convoy <b>on</b> <b>way</b> to Hostalric, killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 prisoners, and on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata, killing 7 of them and taking 28 prisoners and 32 horses.|$|E

25|$|Laid down as Red Jacket, Quistconck was {{the first}} Hog Islander built. Her keel was laid on 18 February 1918. She was built <b>on</b> <b>way</b> number 1 of the American International's shipyard. It took 1,160,000 {{man-hours}} to construct her, partly because the shipyard was still under construction {{at the same time}} Quistconck was (the next ship only needed 601,00 man-hours to complete and third required only 400,000 man-hours). She was christened on 5 August 1918 by Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, wife of American President Woodrow Wilson and launched that day in front of 60,000 spectators. Due to the hot weather at the time, there were no speeches. Immediately following the launch, the keel of the next ship was laid. She was built for the USSB. The United States Official Number 217144 and Code Letters LNMB were allocated. Quistconck was delivered on 3 December 1918.|$|E

As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour. One example followed an incident at a party celebrating the victory of the yes vote in the Welsh devolution referendum, 1997, as when asked how she felt about the result, she responded [...] "What we want to know is who is going to shag Siân Lloyd?" [...] Lloyd subsequently launched legal action, but accepted an apology from Matthews.|$|E

[...] There he formed many useful political connections, as senators, representatives, admirals, and generals were all frequent social visitors to his centrally-located D.C. house, which would later become the Capitol Hill Club.

[...] During this stint, Rear Admiral McCain became an effective advocate for the Navy in congressional hearings and behind-the-scenes dealmaking, and helped persuade Congress to restore budget allocations it had earlier cut from construction programs for aircraft carriers.|$|E
