5|$|Always {{interested}} in military history, Kippenberger joined the local {{unit of the}} New Zealand Cadet Corps and found that he enjoyed soldiering. His father did not approve of his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because <b>only</b> <b>men</b> between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{volunteered for}} the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in October 1915. Because <b>only</b> <b>men</b> {{between the ages of}} 19 and 45 were {{required}} to register for service with the NZEF, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas. A member of the 12th Reinforcements, he embarked for the Western Front via Egypt on 1 May 1916. In France, he was posted to B Company, Wellington Infantry Battalion with the rank of private.|$|E
5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the <b>only</b> <b>men</b> to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Britain {{suffered}} severe {{shortages of}} raw materials. While consideration {{was given to}} reopening the closed mines, this was not deemed viable and instead the few remaining mines increased their production. As many male workers were away on military service, some women were briefly employed in tin-picking at Geevor, and in ore-dressing at the Great Rock iron mine on Dartmoor, {{during and after the}} war until around 1952. Other than a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting <b>only</b> <b>men</b> for underground work in the few surviving mines, the Geevor pickers were the last female manual labourers in the Cornish mining industry.|$|E

5|$|Faryl {{was fairly}} well {{received}} by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism {{was directed at}} {{the use of the}} orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, Faryl was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award in the album of the year category, but lost to <b>Only</b> <b>Men</b> Aloud's Band of Brothers. In 2013, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{after the}} release of Smith's second album, Faryl was {{nominated}} for a Classical BRIT Award in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling classical albums of the previous year. Faryl lost to <b>Only</b> <b>Men</b> Aloud's Band of Brothers. Smith also lost in the young British classical performer category to Jack Liebeck, a violinist. Smith became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. In November, Smith was awarded the best classical award at the 2009 Variety Club awards, the youngest ever recipient in the awards' 57-year history.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{after the}} release of Wonderland, Faryl was {{nominated}} for a Classical BRIT Award in the album category.

Smith herself was also nominated in the young British classical performer category, becoming the youngest ever double Classical BRIT nominee.|$|E
60|$|What {{a change}} has come over Switzerland, {{and in fact}} all Europe, during this century! Seventy or eighty years ago Napoleon was the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> in Europe who could really be called a traveler; he was the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> who had devoted his {{attention}} to it and taken a powerful interest in it; he was the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> who had traveled extensively; but now everybody goes everywhere; and Switzerland, and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago, are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer. But I digress.|$|R

5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games, when <b>only</b> <b>men</b> were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man's effort.|$|E
5|$|The college officially {{opened on}} October 4, 1876 with six professors. Forty{{students}} were {{present on the}} first day of classes, but by the end of the school year the number had grown to 106students. <b>Only</b> <b>men</b> were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart. Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a meeting point for the Great Western Cattle Trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{final day}} of the opening weekend began with the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and the Prince of Wales who met First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Lord Rowe-Beddoe, and marked the event by {{unveiling}} a plaque. Philip Madoc, Siân Phillips, Gaby Roslin, Michael Ball, Charlotte Church, Catrin Finch and <b>Only</b> <b>Men</b> Aloud! were among the artists that entertained the audience during the first act. The second act was opened by the Welsh National Opera and later the Kirov Ballet and Cirque Éloize entertained the audience. Bryn Terfel ended the celebrations.|$|E

5|$|The {{lives of}} Elves only endure {{as the world}} endures. It is said in the Second Prophecy of Mandos {{that at the end}} of time the Elves will join the other Children of Ilúvatar in singing the Second Music of the Ainur. However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the {{published}} Silmarillion states that <b>only</b> <b>Men</b> shall participate for certain in the Second Music, and that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown. However, they do not believe that Eru will abandon them to oblivion.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that <b>only</b> <b>men</b> could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier Richard N. Gale, {{who would}} later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of the 1st Parachute Brigade on its {{formation}} in September 1941. A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he would keep the already trained unit together. On 15September it was renamed the 1st Parachute Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, now formed the 1st Parachute Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. <b>Only</b> <b>men</b> in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any one unit were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by the 4th Parachute Battalion, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, and the 1st (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE). The 4th Parachute Battalion left the brigade in July {{to become the first}} battalion in the 2nd Parachute Brigade.|$|E

Commenting on Walsh's uninhibited pride in the accomplishment, Dryden described Walsh as [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> I've ever known who could strut sitting down." [...] Dryden's line was later recycled in other works. In the 1931 Academy Award-winning film, Cimarron, the leading man (played by Richard Dix) says of his adversary, [...] "He is the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> who can strut while sitting down." [...] In the 1955 play Inherit the Wind, the Clarence Darrow character called William Jennings Bryan [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> I've ever known who could strut sitting down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Federer has won {{the most}} grand slam tournament titles for a male player (19). He has reached the most finals (29), semifinals (42) and quarterfinals (50).

He is the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> to reach each final at least five times. He is the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> to win three tournaments five times each. He is the <b>only</b> <b>man</b> to win two of these tournaments five times consecutively. He is one of eight men to win all four majors.|$|R
5|$|Civil and {{criminal}} cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. In an uncommon case, heard at the Castellania in 1774, was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, petitioned for a sex change by wearing as a man, {{instead of the}} female clothing worn ever since born. Two medical experts were appointed by the court to perform an examination. This case gives detail {{of the use of}} experts in the field, similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief (during the British period was replaced by the Chief Government Medical Officer) and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear <b>only</b> <b>men</b> clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven medical experts that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{practical}} limitations {{of meetings with}} 74 members {{on a regular basis}} (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX, as it was called. It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber, and <b>only</b> <b>men</b> of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust. Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade. These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time in nearly two decades that number 1 played number 2 and neither had won the French Open previously. Andy Murray had a career {{resurgence}} on clay, making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open, finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome. Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic's case, he had to play 4 matches in 5 days. Murray was playing to become the first Brit since 1937 to win, while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line, most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the <b>only</b> <b>men</b> to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time. After Murray took the first set, Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing in four sets.|$|E
