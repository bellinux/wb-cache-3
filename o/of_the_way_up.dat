5|$|On June 9, 1832, {{between two}} attacks that {{occurred}} at Fort Blue Mounds, {{a party of}} Native Americans crossed over from {{the west side of}} the Mississippi River near Galena. The group continued up the Apple River, looting and stealing horses along the way, including an incident about ¾ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small stockade. The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in the marshes of southwestern Wisconsin. A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted a reaction from the white militia in the area.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E
25|$|The Sovereign {{sometimes}} declares {{other days}} when the Union Flag is to fly at half-mast. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the flagpole with at least {{the height of the}} flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole.|$|E
50|$|Declared {{a nature}} park in 2002, the Montsant Natural Park is a veritable symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Priorat and <b>of</b> {{southern}} Catalonia. It is a compact massif, largely surrounded by cliffs and rocky slopes {{made up of}} Oligocene conglomerates. To get up there, choose your grau, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>up</b> and through <b>the</b> cliffs. Some are relatively easy, following old mule tracks, while others are only passable on foot, with dizzying views and some surprises. From the top there are magnificent views, over all the villages nestling at its foot.|$|R

25|$|The dome is 42 meters {{wide and}} made of two shells. A {{stairway}} winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark {{the edges of the}} eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend {{from the base of the}} dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated iron cramps also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the dome, and one two thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the dome.

25|$|El Camino Real (Spanish for The Royal Road, {{also known}} as The King's Highway), {{sometimes}} associated with Calle Real (within the US state of California), usually refers to the 600-mile (965-kilometer) road connecting the 21 Spanish missions in California (formerly Alta California), along {{with a number of}} sub-missions, four presidios, and three pueblos, stretching at its southern end from the San Diego area Mission San Diego de Alcalá, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> to the trail's northern terminus at Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, just above San Francisco Bay.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, {{a pint of}} Guinness {{should be}} served in a {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the glass). To begin the pour, the server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the tap and fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of}} the tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} {{from human}} habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia. The Roman attack ramp still {{stands on the}} western side and can be climbed on foot. Many of the ancient buildings have been restored from their remains, as have the wall paintings of Herod's two main palaces, and the Roman-style bathhouses that he built. The synagogue, storehouses, and houses of the Jewish rebels have also been identified and restored. The meter-high circumvallation wall that the Romans built around Masada can be seen, together with 11 barracks for the Roman soldiers just outside this wall. Water cisterns two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the cliff drain the nearby wadis by an elaborate system of channels, which explains how the rebels managed to conserve enough water for such a long time.|$|E

25|$|About {{a quarter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the Kaimai's, SH 29 passes the Ruahihi Power Station and crosses the Wairoa River. About {{halfway up the}} Kaimais, the highway travels through the small village of Lower Kaimai. Once at the Kaimai Summit, SH 29 descends steeply to the Waikato Region. After passing a {{junction}} with SH 28, SH 29 reaches a T-Junction with SH 24. Due to {{the layout of the}} junction, traffic wishing to stay on SH 29 must turn at this junction. 4km after the junction, SH 29 reaches the village of Te Poi. SH 29 crosses SH 27 at a staggered T-Junction before entering the village of Hinuera. SH 29 then runs through the Hinuera Gap, which the Waikato River used to flow through until volcanic debris altered its course 20,000 years ago. SH 29 terminates at a T-Junction with SH 1 near Piarere.|$|E
25|$|Wagner's and Harker's men started {{climbing}} {{soon after}} Wood's brigades. Wagner got halfway up before {{he received an}} order {{that he was to}} stop {{at the base of the}} ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner's brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault. When Wagner and some of Harker's men returned to the rifle pits they saw that Wood's division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second line up the ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up also. To their right, Francis Sherman's brigade faced an entrenched line about one-half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the ridge and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson's two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits and were slow in starting up the ridge.|$|E

These were accompanied by artillery, firing 200 yards ahead, but it was ordered to stop when it began to hit too close to the troops. After nine hours of climbing they were two thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> when they were hit by heavy fire. Five of the six tank commanders in the motorized force were hit by Syrian commandos lying {{at the side of the}} road. The reconnaissance company was also hit and its commander was killed. The exchange of fire took place at range of a few yards. In addition to snipers, the Syrians also used Israeli machine guns taken from the outpost after the first battle.|$|E

25|$|LD-49 (also {{referred}} to as L5-49) is a large pyramid {{to the south of}} the plaza and is topped by three temple sanctuaries. The pyramid is the largest structure in the site core and rises about 20meters over the plaza. This pyramid's main stairway (known as Hieroglyphic Stairway2) contains at least eighteen hieroglyphic steps, describing the arrival and life of B'alaj Chan K'awiil. The discovery of eight new hieroglyphic steps in 2001–2002 and their interpretation lead to a complete reevaluation of the early history of the site, throwing light upon the wider Maya politics involved with the break from Tikal, formerly seen as an internal affair. The steps currently insitu are replicas put in place after looters stole a section of Step6 containing four glyphs in January 2003. The original steps were removed to a secure location. Flanking the stairway at the east and west ends are Panel6 and Panel7, both bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions. The well-preserved Panel10 is located part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>up</b> {{the east side of the}} pyramid. Panel10 was originally a stela at Arroyo dePiedra, it was moved and re-erected here after DosPilas conquered its neighbour.|$|E

The four-lane, [...] toll road, which has no shoulders or sidewalks, begins at Cottonwood Drive, I-84's north side frontage road. It immediately crosses a bridge over the Weber River (the Davis-Weber County line and north limit of South Weber) and the Union Pacific Railroad's Evanston Subdivision (the south limit of Washington Terrace).

500|$|It was {{possible}} to sail {{all the way to}} the Klondike, first from Seattle across the northern Pacific to the Alaskan coast.

Although this all-water route, also called [...] "the rich man's route", was expensive and long – [...] in total – it had the attraction of speed and avoiding overland travel. At the beginning of the stampede a ticket could be bought for $150 ($4,050) while during the winter 1897–98 the fare settled at $1,000 ($27,000).|$|E
