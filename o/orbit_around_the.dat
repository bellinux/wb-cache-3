5|$|The Moon's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth is {{inclined}} {{at an angle}} of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neutron star.|$|E
5|$|At Jupiter, Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA pod to {{investigate}} another monolith discovered in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> planet. The pod is {{pulled into a}} vortex of colored light, and Bowman races across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colors.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellite}} forms part of {{the growing}} amounts of orbital debris <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth. The payload will decay in the Earth's atmosphere {{some time in the}} future.|$|R
50|$|For <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth, solar {{radiation}} pressure becomes a stronger force than drag above 800 km altitude.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016, the probes are {{no longer}} functional, but still remain in their {{elliptical}} <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|R
5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, {{the two men}} sat {{together}} in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that}} of Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
50|$|Kepler-345b is an Exoplanet, <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star Kepler-345. It was {{discovered}} in 2014, by the Kepler space probe.|$|R
50|$|Kelly’s year {{in space}} {{included}} 5,440 <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth and he conducted three spacewalks before returning home in March 2016.|$|R
50|$|The satellite, {{which is}} now non-operational, forms {{a part of the}} growing amounts of space debris <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth. The payload will decay in the Earth's {{atmosphere}} some time in the future.|$|R
5|$|Saturn's {{satellite}} system is very lopsided: one moon, Titan, comprises more than 96% {{of the mass}} in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> planet. The six other planemo (ellipsoidal) moons constitute roughly 4% of the mass, and the remaining 55 small moons, together with the rings, comprise only 0.04%.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{planets and}} officially {{recognized}} dwarf planets {{are known to}} be orbited by 184 natural satellites, or moons. 19 moons in the Solar System are large enough to be gravitationally rounded, and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets if they were in direct <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
50|$|Colombo also {{explained}} the spin-orbit resonance in Mercury's orbit, showing that it rotates three times for every two <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|R
50|$|HD 12661 b {{is a giant}} {{exoplanet}} two and a {{half times}} the mass of Jupiter <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star HD 12661.|$|R
50|$|Most Kuiper belt objects have {{prograde}} <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The first Kuiper belt object {{discovered to}} have a retrograde orbit is.|$|R
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun are the basis of solar calendars, {{one of which is}} the predominant calendar in use today.|$|E
5|$|The next {{mission to}} {{encounter}} Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe. It performed a flyby maneuver {{to attain a}} polar <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying {{distance from}} Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest {{distance from the}} Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed {{that they could have}} been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun. However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
