5|$|Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned {{biochemist}} David Robert Jones is {{visited by}} his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones {{that the job}} in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E
25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way}} that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In reality, Faith {{was stolen}} by Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), {{who gave her}} to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) to raise as her own after he caused Ashley to miscarry. Without {{knowledge}} of this, Sharon romanced and married Adam. After reuniting with Faith, Nick and Sharon grew even closer. Nick and Phyllis broke up and got a divorce, leading him to reunite with Sharon. He proposed to her, and she accepted. However, Sharon could not get Adam out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> slept with him in New Orleans. Nick left Sharon after she cheated, {{and she began to}} devote her time to get charges against Adam for the murder of his ex-wife Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone).|$|E
60|$|Here Mr. Guppy's mother {{fell into}} an {{extraordinary}} passion <b>of</b> rolling <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> smiling waggishly at anybody who {{would look at}} her.|$|R

500|$|In 1870, aged eleven, Ellen {{began work}} as a nursemaid in nearby Marlow, but she began {{suffering}} periods of somnolence and her employment was terminated. She was subsequently attended by a local doctor, Henry Hayman F.R.C.S., from nearby Stokenchurch. Ellen had been suffering for 13weeks from [...] "glandular swellings" [...] or an abscess on the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> symptoms consistent with a spinal disease. The family {{did not have much}} money, so the parish vicar, The Reverend Studholme, asked Hayman to secure Ellen's admission to a local hospital, where her condition worsened. Ellen stayed at the hospital for 18weeks before being [...] "discharged as incurable" [...] in March 1871.|$|E
500|$|For the {{localization}} of the game, {{the team}} {{decided to give}} the character of Drippy a Welsh accent, citing comedian Rhod Gilbert as a reference point. Steffan Rhodri was ultimately cast as Drippy; the team immediately felt that he fit the role, during his first audition. The Fairy Godmother character was initially conceived as an [...] "older lady with a perm", which evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "mountain-like woman". The method that she uses to give birth, in which the offspring burst forth, was inspired by the process that sea anemones lay eggs. The character of Cassiopeia was conceived in a quick meeting, after which the background information and story documents were handed to Momose, who drew the character based on the information. Cassiopeia underwent various changes throughout development. In particular, Momose suggested possible alterations to her physical appearance, such as the size <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> changing colors to reflect her emotions. The character Pea was named as a reference to the fairy tale The Princess and the Pea, while her Japanese name of Kokoru is a reference to the word [...]|$|E

60|$|Yet we {{are going}} to inculcate more and more self-consciousness, teach every little Mary to be more and more a nice little Mary out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> every little Joseph to theorize himself up to the scratch.|$|R
60|$|As {{he peered}} {{in at the}} tepee door Wetherell {{perceived}} Pogosa dimly. She was sitting erect in her bed. Her eyes were wide, the pose <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> erect <b>and</b> vigorous. She appeared a span taller, and when she spoke her voice seemed to issue from a deep and powerful chest.|$|R
60|$|Tom turned, {{and walked}} sorrowfully {{back to the}} house. In the court he met little Eva,--a crown <b>of</b> tuberoses on <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes radiant with delight.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, doctors {{performed}} emergency surgery to extract skull fragments {{and a small}} amount of [...] tissue from her brain. The bullet passed through Giffords's head without crossing the midline of the brain, where the most critical injuries typically result. Part of her skull was removed to avoid further damage to the brain from pressure caused by swelling. Doctors who first treated Giffords said the bullet entered the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> exited through the front of her skull, but physicians later concluded that it had traveled in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of October 31, 2009, at {{approximately}} 10:00 pm Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7), Brenton and his partner, trainee officer Britt Sweeney, were both sitting in their patrol car following a traffic stop at 29th Avenue South and East Yesler Way in the Central District. Sweeney {{was sitting in the}} driver's seat with Brenton in the passenger seat. As they were debriefing the traffic stop they had just performed, a vehicle pulled up alongside their police car and someone inside opened fire with a rifle. [...] Sweeney ducked, and a bullet grazed the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> her back. Brenton, meanwhile, was mortally wounded in the attack. The suspect's vehicle reversed, turned around, and fled the scene in the direction from which it had come. As the vehicle was fleeing the scene, Sweeney managed to call for help, exit the patrol car, and return fire.|$|E
60|$|She resented his {{laughing}} at her, with an obstinate shake <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> an angry knitting of her pretty eyebrows.|$|E
60|$|She {{had thrown}} {{herself at the}} bottom of the wagon, with her back towards him and her doll in her lap. He could see the curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> curly <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> beyond, <b>her</b> bare dimpled knees, which were raised, and over which she was trying to fold the hem <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brief skirt.|$|R
50|$|Charkula is a {{traditional}} folk dance of the Braj. In this dance, a woman balances a column <b>of</b> deepikas on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> dances {{to the accompaniment of}} Rasiya songs by the menfolk.|$|R
60|$|She laughed gaily--and {{she had a}} {{way when}} she laughed <b>of</b> {{throwing}} back <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> showing <b>her</b> beautiful white teeth, so that mirth from her was a thing very much to be desired.|$|R

60|$|Ralph gave it, {{with his}} thirsty eyes fixed, expectant, on {{something}} {{round the corner}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> the smile, which never moved, on his cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did you {{not wait}} for me, sir, to escort me downstairs?" [...] she said, giving a little toss <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> a most sarcastic curtsey.|$|E
6000|$|... "While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl {{on the left side}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> Clara, <b>and</b> don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands," [...] said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.|$|R
60|$|Presently Malchus {{was sent}} for again, and found Julia {{sitting on the}} couch by the side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother, and he at once {{acknowledged}} to himself that he had seldom seen a fairer woman. She was tall, and her figure was full and well proportioned. Her glossy hair was wound in a coil at the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>her</b> neck <b>and</b> arms were bare, and she wore a garment of light green silk, and embroidered with gold stripes along the bottom, reaching down to her knees, while beneath it a petticoat of Tyrian purple reached nearly to the ground.|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{community}} of Fez was awestruck by Hachuel's heroism. They {{had to pay}} for the retrieval <b>of</b> <b>her</b> corpse, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the bloodstained earth for a Jewish burial at the Jewish cemetery. She was declared a martyr.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne sat {{upright in}} her chair. Her {{stepmother}} noticed a new air of determination in the poise <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> the firm lines of her mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "We renounce them all," [...] she corrected, {{and gave}} a solemn little nod <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sighed, and thus they {{ratified}} that audacious compact of oblivion.|$|E
60|$|How lovely she {{was with}} the effort of close {{attention}} depicted in the turn <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> in her whole face honestly trying to approve. “And then?” she inquired.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} the queen overheard a party of these {{soldiers}} talking about her. They knew that to get possession of the papist queen was the object of their expedition. They spoke <b>of</b> getting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> carrying it to London, saying that Parliament had offered a reward of fifty thousand crowns for it, and expressed the savage pleasure which it would give them to secure this prize, by imprecations and oaths.|$|R
60|$|One of the tufts {{by which}} he held came out at the root, and Knight began to follow the quartz. It was a terrible moment. Elfride uttered a low wild wail <b>of</b> agony, bowed <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> covered <b>her</b> face with her hands.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Berry, without ceasing {{to stare}} Mr. Piper out <b>of</b> countenance, shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and,</b> folding <b>her</b> arms, again stated her opinion that Mr. Cox wanted a shock, and {{expressed}} a great yearning {{to be the}} humble means of giving him one.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment, and he could only see the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> its heavy brown coils. After a pause she asked abruptly, [...] "Where's your handkerchief?" ...|$|E
60|$|With {{a slight}} {{inclination}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> withholding her hand intentionally, she moved away, whilst I stood, {{as only a}} fool or a statue would stand, and watched her go.|$|E
6000|$|... “Certainly,” said Elizabeth, {{returning}} his bow by {{a slight}} inclination <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> urging the tardy Louisa forward. As {{they entered the}} jailer’s house, however, Miss Grant found leisure to whisper: ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Spring, three nude maidens gather {{flowers to}} string into garlands. [...] One {{sits on the}} ground, holding the garland on which she has been working, as a second holds a string <b>of</b> {{blossoms}} above <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> a third picks flowers to add.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{the moment}} for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it. She forgot every word <b>of</b> it, hung <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> answered, [...] "I don't know," [...] so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} Lucy, sir, you'd realize how strange it is," [...] went on young Gates, earnestly. [...] "She {{was such a}} gentle, {{shrinking}} girl, as shy and retiring as a child. And she never did a thing that would cause anyone the least worry or unhappiness. But she was out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> sir, <b>and</b> didn't {{know what she was}} about. That was the reason she went away. And from the moment she left her home all trace <b>of</b> <b>her</b> was lost." ...|$|R
