5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong {{respected}} and befriended {{members of the}} scholar-gentry. They admired him {{even though he was}} a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. Even when he was busy with work, he always took time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord. He immediately got out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> receive Sheng Xian and held Sheng's hand while leading him to meet Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|The {{stopover}} in {{the subcontinent}} {{meant that the}} Australians arrived home {{after the start of}} the 1956–57 season. No Tests were scheduled for the season. Burke started with a pair against Western Australia in his first match back, and then scored only two in the return match, although New South Wales won both games nonetheless. In the next match, he struck 220 of his state's 454 as they complete an innings win over South Australia. Over the Christmas period, Burke was a pivotal figure in the first tie in Sheffield Shield history. In the first innings, he carried his bat to make 132 of New South Wales' 281, giving them a 37-run lead over Victoria. In the second innings, the reigning champions had a target of 161, and Burke had to retire hurt with an injury. New South Wales collapsed to 7/70, forcing the ill captain Ian Craig to raise himself out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> bat. The score proceeded to 145, whereupon Burke returned upon the fall of Richie Benaud. Craig fell three runs later with the score at 148. Burke reached 8 and the scores were on 9/160 when he edged Ian Meckiff to wicket-keeper Len Maddocks, ending the match in a tie.|$|E

500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her {{not to do it}} again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, David Bowie {{released}} the album Diamond Dogs. It {{is thought to}} be loosely based on the novel 1984. It includes the tracks [...] "We Are The Dead", [...] "1984" [...] and [...] "Big Brother". Before the album was made, Bowie's management (MainMan) had planned for Bowie and Tony Ingrassia (MainMan's creative consultant) to co-write and direct a musical production of Orwell's 1984, but apparently, Bowie loathed doing anything on assignment and showed his disinterest by not getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> work on the project. Orwell's widow was appalled at the idea and refused to give MainMan the rights.|$|E

After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>to</b> lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E
