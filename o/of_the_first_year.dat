5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, {{during the}} War of the First Coalition, Ernouf {{was sent to}} Cassel to {{strengthen}} the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to Dunkirk and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison {{to fend off the}} British. Ernouf assembled a force of a thousand men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of Dunkirk. Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 complémentaire an I (21September 1793), which would have been the last day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the new Republic, he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vendémiaire an II (30September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|The Reg Hayter Cup for the NatWest PCA Player of the Year is {{an annual}} cricket award.

With the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> when a joint award was made, the award has been bestowed upon one individual each season.

5|$|The main {{campus of}} the college was {{originally}} in Madison, New Jersey. Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid served as the first college president (1856–1857, 1859–1868) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young, vice-president; Reverend Daniel Fisher (the second college president, 1857–1859) and five lay instructors. Initially, Seton Hall had only five students– Leo G. Thebaud, Louis and Alfred Boisaubin, Peter Meehan and John Moore. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> the student body had grown more than tenfold to 60. The college moved to its current location in 1860.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} these reforms {{was to provide a}} sizable, well-trained force in the British Isles, which could be sent {{overseas}} in time of crisis, with a system of reservists and home-service volunteers to support it. However, with the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, the system immediately began to show some strain; by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of fighting, the reserves had been entirely exhausted. Various novel measures, including the extensive use of auxiliary forces, were experimented with {{for the remainder of the}} war; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars, the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions, and the Imperial Yeomanry was created to supply much-needed mounted infantry.|$|E
5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1949 Higginbotham entered Yale Law School. As he had in grade school, he worked, this time as a butcher, to help support himself while at Yale. He {{was a member of}} the moot court team and the Barrister's Union (a mock trial organization). Higginbotham {{advanced}} to the finals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> moot court competition. He argued before a panel that included Justice Clark of the Supreme Court of the United States, and renowned appellate advocate John W. Davis, who would later argue against Thurgood Marshall on behalf of the State of Kansas in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1951, Higginbotham competed on a moot court team with Richard N. Gardner, who would later serve as United States Ambassador to Spain and the United States Ambassador to Italy. Higginbotham's team argued against a team from Temple University Law School, which included his future law partner and judicial colleague, Clifford Scott Green.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} the clashes around Constantinople are unclear, as Theophanes {{condenses}} the siege in his account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> and the Arab chroniclers do not mention the siege at all but merely provide the names of leaders of unspecified expeditions into Byzantine territory. Thus from the Arab sources it is only known that Abdallah ibn Qays and Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd raided Crete and wintered there in 675, while {{in the same year}} Malik ibn Abdallah led a raid into Asia Minor. The Arab historians Ibn Wadih and al-Tabari report that Yazid was dispatched by Mu'awiya with reinforcements to Constantinople in 676, and record that Abdallah ibn Qays led a campaign in 677, whose target is unknown. At the same time, the Byzantines had to face a Slavic attack on Thessalonica and Lombard attacks in Italy. Finally, in autumn 677 or early 678 Constantine IV resolved to confront the Arab besiegers in a head-on engagement. His fleet, equipped with Greek fire, routed the Arab fleet. It is probable that the death of admiral Yazid ibn Shagara, reported by Arab chroniclers for 677/678, is related to this defeat. At about the same time, the Muslim army in Asia Minor, under the command of Sufyan ibn 'Awf, was defeated by the Byzantine army under the generals Phloros, Petron and Cyprian, losing 30,000 men according to Theophanes. These defeats forced the Arabs to abandon the siege in 678. On its way back to Syria, the Arab fleet was almost annihilated in a storm off Syllaion.|$|E
