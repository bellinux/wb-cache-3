5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve their <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

When they do broach sensitive subjects with their children, they usually psychoanalyze them as well, a habit that has a very bad effect on Lilly. Michael, who is more perceptive, avoids their attention by keeping more to himself. Lilly has inherited her intelligence and hobby of analyzing people from them.|$|E

Nicol, Pegg, and Mattacks had recorded and toured with Richard and Linda Thompson at times in the 1970s, and did so again during this period, culminating in their appearance on the Shoot Out the Lights album and tour in 1982. Bruce Rowlands gave up the music business and moved to Denmark {{and as a result}} Dave Mattacks returned as drummer for Fairport’s occasional gigs. Dave Pegg was the first of several Fairporters to join Jethro Tull which gave him well-paying steady employment. Simon Nicol had teamed up with Dave Swarbrick in a highly regarded acoustic duo, but this partnership was made difficult by Swarbrick’s sudden decision to move to Scotland, where, from 1984 he began to focus on his new project Whippersnapper.|$|E
25|$|George Lillo and Richard Steele {{wrote the}} trend-setting plays {{of the early}} Augustan period. Lillo's plays {{consciously}} turned from heroes and kings and toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale, rather than a national scale, and the hamartia and agon in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of Christian sin. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and repentance. Steele's The Conscious Lovers (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a duel. The plays {{set up a new}} set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing the audience or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and to ennoble it. Also, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> concerns (Legouis 782–787, 879–883).|$|E

According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is [...] "one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture."

[...] "In light of this response", Howe continued, [...] "they were shot" [...] by [...] "military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police".

500|$|Writer Mike Bullen's first script, {{an hour-long}} comedy {{entitled}} The Perfect Match, {{was produced by}} Granada Television in 1995. Granada's controller of comedy Andy Harries {{was pleased with the}} balance Bullen's script struck between comedy and drama. Eager to develop a television series for middle-class thirty-somethings, Harries had Bullen pitch ideas to The Perfect Match assistant producer Christine Langan, with a view to making a pilot. Bullen's initial idea was a typical [...] "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back" [...] story, but told {{from both sides of the}} relationship. Langan accepted Bullen's pitch and he began writing a first draft. Bullen and Langan were influenced by the American television series Thirtysomething and the film When Harry Met Sally; the stories were funny and dramatic but neither aspect was [...] "ghettoised". Believing that there was little television aimed at people like them, Bullen and Langan discussed their <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> friends, using personal experiences to create the characters: Adam was based on Bullen before he met his wife and Rachel was based on a combination of his ex-girlfriends and [...] "the fantasy girlfriend". When writing his first draft, Bullen realised that telling the same story from both sides of the relationship would mean repeating something that the audience had already seen. To rectify this he introduced the fantasy scenes and the idea of the characters reporting events in a slightly different way to what really happened.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 303, Diocletian {{ordered that}} the newly built Christian church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized. February 23 was {{the feast of}} the Terminalia, for Terminus, the god of boundaries. It was the day they would {{terminate}} Christianity. The next day, Diocletian's first [...] "Edict against the Christians" [...] was published. The key targets of this piece of legislation were, as they had been during Valerian's persecution, Christian property and senior clerics. The edict prohibited Christians from assembling for worship, and ordered the destruction of their scriptures, liturgical books, and places of worship across the empire. But Christians tried to retain the scriptures as far as possible, though, according to de Ste Croix, [...] "it appears that giving them up...was not regarded as a sin" [...] in the East; sufficient numbers of them must have been successfully saved, as is evident from the representative findings of [...] "early biblical papyri" [...] in the stream of the transmission of the text during this period. Christians might have given up apocryphal or pseudepigraphal works, or even refused to surrender their scriptures at the cost of their <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>and</b> there were some cases where the scriptures were not in the end destroyed. Christians were also deprived of the right to petition the courts, making them potential subjects for judicial torture; Christians could not respond to actions brought against them in court; Christian senators, equestrians, decurions, veterans, and soldiers were deprived of their ranks; and Christian imperial freedmen were re-enslaved.|$|E

500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>and</b> that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

[...] Marcotte noted that the [...] "Resistance" [...] is lead, for the audience, by two women in Johnson and Simmons, reflecting the 2017 Women's March, and also that Hydra gained power using fear of Inhumans just as [...] "Trump was able to ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into power". She also highlighted Simmons' warning to a young boy that all Hydra agent are Nazis, calling this a warning [...] "to the audience, reminding them not to forget exactly what kind of authoritarian monster has been put in the White House." [...] Michal Schick of Hypable noted that the political commentary had been running throughout the season, with Nadeer and the Humans First movement, but that [...] "in the face of murderous demons with combustable craniums and body-swapping LMD’s, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. largely kept the commentary in the background. That changed—drastically—as the show entered" [...] the final pod. Schick highlighted the fact that [...] "for all of the clear allusions to Trump’s America, the president himself remains unparodied. The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to imagine a more different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida.
