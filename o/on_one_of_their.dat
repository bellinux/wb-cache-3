5|$|The Kosačas liberated {{almost all}} of their land during the autumn of 1463, and even succeeded in occupying some of the former royal domain.

Catherine left Ragusa permanently in September 1465, but her subsequent whereabouts can only be conjectured. She likely lived in Zachlumia or in the area of Šibenik. The Grand Duke, her father, died in 1466.|$|E
