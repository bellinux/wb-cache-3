5|$|After {{three years}} of dating, they {{eventually}} decided to marry while discussing {{the issue in the}} couple's favorite booth at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. They married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in a simple and hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press. The <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> attendance were fellow actor William Holden (the best man) and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall (the matron of honor). Nancy was already pregnant during the ceremony; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan (later better known as Ron Reagan) was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941–2001) and Michael Reagan (born 1945), the daughter and adopted son of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

Part of the Kaunian Empire many centuries ago, about one-tenth of the prewar population were blond ethnic Kaunians, the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Derlavai to speak classical Kaunian as a birth language. Previous to Six Years' War Forthweg was partitioned between Algarve and Unkerlant, but later gained independence after that war. King Penda declared war on Algarve {{as part of the}} initial coalition against Algarve, but was attacked by both Algarve and Unkerlant and the country got re-partitioned; later, the whole is occupied by Algarve {{and at the end of}} the war is occupied by Unkerlant, which decides not to annex it outright but make it a satellite. Forthweg has a subtropical climate, with olive and citrus groves a prominent part of its agriculture. Forthwegians and Kaunians alike are extremely fond of gathering mushrooms. Forthweg's largest city as well as its capital is Eoforwic. Forthwegian names are drawn from Old English.|$|E

Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours. Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan {{is known to have}} fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.|$|E

500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world who are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E

[...] In the late 19th century, Pullman porters were among the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> their communities to travel extensively. Consequently, they became a conduit of new information and ideas from the wider world to their communities. Many Pullman porters supported community projects, including schools, and saved rigorously to ensure that their children were able to obtain an education and thus better employment. [...] Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown were descendants of Pullman porters. [...] Marshall was also a porter himself, as were Malcolm X and the photojournalist Gordon Parks.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2000, Simard {{said that}} he would not serve {{alongside}} Yves Michaud, a candidate for the PQ nomination in an upcoming Montreal by-election. Michaud had characterized Jewish support for the Canadian federalist option in the 1995 Quebec referendum as an [...] "ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the Quebec people" [...] and described B'nai Brith Canada as [...] "anti-sovereigntist extremists." [...] He was also quoted as saying that Jews believed themselves to be [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world who have suffered." [...] Simard described Michaud's comments as [...] "an old anti-Semitic throwback that leave me no choice but to condemn." [...] Michaud, in turn, contended that he was [...] "falsely demonized" [...] by the reporting of his comments and was not anti-Semitic. This controversy exposed divisions in the ranks of the PQ and is widely believed to have provoked Lucien Bouchard's resignation as premier shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Everything that Chamberlain {{viewed as}} {{good in the}} world was {{ascribed}} to the Aryans. For an example, in The Foundations [...] Chamberlain explained at considerable length that Jesus Christ could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan. Chamberlain's tendency to see everything good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood which supposedly flowed in the veins of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a [...] "lost ideal" [...] of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner. Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government. Reflecting his opposition to feminism, Chamberlain lamented how modern women were not like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands. Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West such as Homer, Dante, Giotto, Donatello, Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, William Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as part of one long glorious tradition of beautiful Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of Richard Wagner in the 19th century. As the British historian George Peabody Gooch wrote, here was [...] "a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen".|$|E
2500|$|The former {{hotel has}} been called the [...] "birthplace of cable {{television}}". In 1948, the Hotel Astoria was the site of the [...] "world's first cable television system", invented by L. E. [...] "Ed" [...] Parsons, then owner of Astoria radio station KAST. Ed Parsons set up the first U.S. cable television system to use coaxial cable and a community antenna to deliver TV signals to an area that otherwise {{would not have been able}} to receive broadcast TV signals. [...] The first television station in the Pacific Northwest was inaugurated in November 1948 by Seattle radio station KRSC, now KING-TV. [...] Astoria being about [...] from Seattle, Parsons [...] "was unable to get a picture in his apartment, even with a high antenna". His apartment was located across the street from the eight-story Hotel Astoria, and with permission from the hotel's manager he set up an antenna on the building's roof and ran coaxial cable from there to his apartment. [...] The set-up worked, and Parsons and his wife were the <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Astoria able to view television, starting on Thanksgiving Day 1948. [...] "Reception was not of a quality that would be saleable today," [...] Parsons told The Oregonian in 1972, [...] "but we received a picture and started attracting guests." [...] The couple quickly became overwhelmed by requests from friends and neighbors eager to pay them a visit to experience the new medium. To appease them, Parsons laid a second cable to a TV set in the hotel's lobby, and by the end of December a nearby music store was the third hook-up. [...] Parsons then began setting up cable television connections to area households, with 25 receiving the service by mid-March 1949 and 100 by July. Some time later, Parsons moved his community antenna from the roof of the Hotel Astoria to a separate location elsewhere in town and also added a second antenna site.|$|E
