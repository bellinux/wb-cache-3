5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004.

5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E

40|$|Conference theme: Real Structures: Bridges and Tall BuildingsThis paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> {{mechanical properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> parts <b>of</b> cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures. Light-gauge structural members are cold-formed which results <b>the</b> mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> parts being {{different from the}} flat parts.

An appropriate model for fire resistant design of steel structures necessitates a correct representation of mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures. Therefore, experimental investigation on corner coupon specimens at different temperatures ranged from approximately 20 to 1000 oC was conducted to study <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> parts <b>of</b> cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures. Two kinds of corner coupon specimens, namely <b>the</b> inner <b>corner</b> coupon specimens and outer corner coupon specimens having <b>the</b> steel grade <b>of</b> G 500 (nominal 0. 2 % proof stress of 500 MPa) and nominal thickness of 1. 9 mm were tested. The test results were compared with the flat coupon specimens taken from the same cold-formed steel sections as <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> coupon specimens. A unified equation to predict the yield strength (0. 2 % proof stress) and elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> parts <b>of</b> cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures is thus proposed in this paper.

5|$|Aston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park, {{which is}} a UEFA 5-star rated stadium, having {{previously}} played at Aston Park (1874–1876) and Wellington Road (1876–1897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, {{and the most recent}} in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. The club have planning permission to extend the North Stand; this will involve the 'filling in' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> to either side of the North Stand. If completed, the capacity of Villa Park will be increased to approximately 51,000.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E

25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations.
