5|$|Although the B-52A was {{the first}} {{production}} variant, these aircraft were used only in testing. The first <b>operational</b> version was the B-52B that had been developed in parallel with the prototypes since 1951. First flying in December 1954, B-52B, AF Serial Number 52-8711, entered <b>operational</b> service with 93rd Heavy Bombardment Wing (93rd BW) at Castle Air Force Base, California, on 29 June 1955. The wing became <b>operational</b> on 12 March 1956. The training for B-52 crews consisted of five weeks of ground school and four weeks of flying, accumulating 35 to 50 hours in the air. The new B-52Bs replaced <b>operational</b> B-36s on a one-to-one basis.|$|E

5|$|Most {{students}} {{participate in}} the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). In 2009, the school held eight AMSP seminars. AMSP is intended to educate students in military arts and science, and focuses on <b>operational</b> art and covers a variety of subjects, including military problem solving; military theory and history, military doctrine, <b>operational</b> planning; battle dynamics, <b>operational</b> theory and practice, contemporary military operations, {{and the application of}} national elements of power. Besides classroom studies and <b>operational</b> exercises, students must complete a research monograph and an oral examination. After graduating, officers serve on a division, corps, or Army Service Component Command staff, or in a functional area assignment.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 <b>Operational</b> Training Unit (No.4 OTU) was an <b>operational</b> {{conversion}} {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force during World WarII. It was formed at Williamtown, New South Wales, in October 1942 to train pilots and wireless air gunners to operate Vultee Vengeance dive bombers. The school was equipped with Vengeances and CAC Wirraway aircraft. Accidents were common in <b>operational</b> {{conversion unit}}s, and No.4 OTU suffered several fatal crashes during its existence. It was disbanded in April 1944, handing Williamtown over to No.5 <b>Operational</b> Training Unit.|$|E

5|$|At {{the opening}} of 1987, {{the last year of}} the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, {{comprising}} 8,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, many multiple rocket launchers (rocket artillery) and regular artillery pieces, Mi-24 helicopters and sixty combat aircraft. These forces did not have a unified command, but were divided into an <b>Operational</b> Group South, active in the Tibesti with 2,500 men, and an <b>Operational</b> Group East, centered in Faya-Largeau.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on <b>operational</b> deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} <b>operational</b> deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|Besides the 102nd Brigade, {{commanded}} by Captain Franc Ferenčak, the Zagreb <b>Operational</b> Zone deployed an armoured-mechanised unit, attached {{directly to the}} Zagreb <b>Operational</b> Zone, into the Sisak OG AOR.

5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several <b>operational</b> {{training units}} (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and <b>operational</b> conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) <b>Operational</b> Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) <b>Operational</b> Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|During its <b>operational</b> life {{two of the}} Cabinet War Rooms were of {{particular}} importance.

5|$|<b>Operational</b> design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} <b>operational</b> design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the <b>operational</b> level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: <b>operational</b> design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E
