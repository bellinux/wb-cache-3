25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> signs.|$|E
2500|$|One of the province's {{most popular}} attractions {{is a group}} of ten totem poles at Brockton Point. Four totem poles were {{originally}} brought from Alert Bay and placed at Lumbermen’s Arch in 1924. [...] Some had been carved back in the late 1880s. [...] More totem poles were purchased in the 1920s and 1930s, this time originating from the Queen Charlotte Islands and Rivers Inlet. All of the totem poles were moved to Brockton Point in 1962 to allow the construction of an <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> at Lumberman's Arch. Many of them have been replaced with replicas, with the originals now kept in museums for preservation.

40|$|Abstact: Based on {{the damage}} of five {{corrosive}} bridges concrete in Shanghai, it {{suggested that the}} strength and durability of C 30 concrete have decreased seriously. These years, a lot of bridges, <b>overhead</b> <b>roads</b> and tram roads have been built, so the study on anticorrosion technology of reinforced concrete bridge will assuredly become a pressing issue. The main measure {{in this article is}} to design the durability of concrete aiming at the reasons why durability decreases at the different environmental conditions. The results of the research suggested that the over-replacement with active mixture technology could assuredly make Cl- penetrative resistance, freezing and thawing resistance and carbonizing resistance improve. It was best when coefficient of over-replacement was 1. 3, and slag was best followed by steel slag, and then fly ash. Furthermore, the over-replacement with active mixture technology could stay concrete forepart shrinkage rate, thereby improving the durability of concrete...|$|R

2500|$|Like the {{surrounding}} area Slussen, named after the lock and built simultaneous to it in 1930–1935, the lock is a concrete construction resting on franki piles (e.g. cast-in-situ piles) located {{along the sides of}} the canal and next to the gates. The base plate is made of reinforced concrete, reinforced with steel sleepers next to the gates. [...] The walls of the canal are dressed in granite reinforced with vertical iron rebates stretching three meters from the bottom and horizontal anchoring irons.

50|$|Since 1936, Escher’s {{work had}} become {{primarily}} focused on paradoxes, tessellation and other abstract visual concepts.

Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon <b>overhead.</b> The <b>road</b> is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks. Escher has thus captured three elements: the water, sky and earth.|$|R

50|$|Toongabbie {{railway station}} {{is on the}} North Shore, Northern & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. The {{original}} unstaffed station opened on 26 April 1880 and was upgraded over the years with additional platforms and loading facilities. In the late 1880s the first rail official was appointed to manage the station, a Miss Amy Arnold. The current station was opened in 1946 and the line was electrified in 1955. The <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> bridge was opened in 1947 (before {{that there was a}} level crossing where the western end of the station platforms are now).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Removal {{of narrow}} <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> bridges on the Cut-Off, {{such as this}} one, the Route 521 bridge over the Cut-Off in Blairstown, NJ, became a major concern after {{abandonment}} of the line. When a bridge was functionally obsolete, as this one was, its replacement became a priority, which with an abandoned railroad might lead to {{the removal of the}} bridge and filling in and paving the road on top of what would become a blockage to the right-of-way below. One of NJRCA's initiatives was to advocate the replacement of overhead bridges with overhead bridges.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} built because of {{increased}} passenger numbers and increased productivity within the St Marys Munitions Works site along {{with the arrival of}} electrification in 1957. The station itself was classed as unattended because most of the workers using the station had weekly tickets or return tickets, making ticket selling facilities unnecessary. The station starts on a slight right-hand bend (looking towards Ropes Creek) and straightens out towards the middle. An <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> bridge ran over the station; the waiting room was built underneath the bridge. The station was about 165 metres long and could accommodate an eight-car suburban train.|$|E

The eastern tunnel was taken out of railway service in the 1970s but is maintained to ensure the integrity of the ground <b>overhead,</b> and provides <b>road</b> vehicle access to Holloway Bank.

50|$|By 1998, the {{structure}} had become severely damaged by decades of dynamic stress from the <b>overhead</b> <b>road</b> traffic {{and by the}} chemical effects of seepage water and highway salt. The tunnel was therefore completely renovated from 1998 to 2000. The large size of the tunnel cross-section, {{and the fact that}} the single-track use was planned to continue in the future, made it possible to construct a new reinforced-concrete inner tube inside the old sandstone arch. The New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was used. To be able to keep the tunnel open to workday railroad traffic, the repairs had to be performed during operational breaks at night and on weekends. To do this, the floor and arch were constructed in 8 m sections.|$|E

It operated from the late 1950s until the early 1970s, when it was demolished and replaced by a row of shops. A small shopping centre and supermarket, the Piccadilly Centre, was built in the 1960s in the area bounded by the Toongabbie Hotel and the Catholic Church. This operated until 2004 when the Piccadilly shopping centre and surrounding properties were purchased by a developer to eventually build Portico Plaza, a shopping centre with a Woolworths supermarket and over 40 specialty shops.|$|E

The road passes through wooded areas near some residential development, bypassing Cleveland to the east.

The route {{comes to an}} interchange with Benton Pike {{before coming to the}} <b>Overhead</b> Bridge <b>Road</b> exit, at which point the freeway widens to six lanes, influenced by the exit ramps at each end of a long bridge. SR-60 passes over a Norfolk Southern railroad line and interchanges with 20th Street NE, making a turn to the northwest and narrowing back to four lanes. The road passes some woods and farms before entering developed areas of homes and businesses as it becomes a surface road again. SR-60 comes to intersections with US-11 (SR-74) and US-11 Bypass (SR-2) in this area, becoming 25th Street.
