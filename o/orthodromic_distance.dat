25|$|The {{following}} month Ferrarin and del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, {{but across the}} South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio {{on the evening of}} 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within radio range of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160km (100mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100km (5,030mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188km (4,500mi) – the <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> between Montecelio and Natal – and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later.|$|E
50|$|Since the Earth {{is roughly}} a sphere, the <b>orthodromic</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> of the {{is often used}} by mariners to find the distance between two coordinates (knowing its longitude and its latitude) on a map, and the course {{to be taken to}} go from one to the other.|$|E
50|$|Watson's planned circumnavigation route was {{to start}} and end at Sydney, and to pass near New Zealand, Fiji, Kiribati, Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and South East Cape. In {{accordance}} with the definitions for circumnavigations set out by the International Sailing Federation's WSSRC, the equator must be crossed; this crossing was carried out near Kiritimati. However, the WSSRC criteria also stipulate that a global circumnavigation must have an <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> of 21,600 nautical miles. Watson's journey did not meet this requirement.|$|E
50|$|The town of Allassac {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of departmental roads D9, D25, D34 and D134. It is also traversed by the Orléans-Montauban railway line with a station at Allassac. It is located, in <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distances,</b> 6 kilometres east of Objat and 12 kilometres north-west of Brive-la-Gaillarde.|$|R
30|$|Lastly, the {{analyses}} proposed {{in this paper}} rested on two additional calculations. One of them consisted in distinguishing six classes of urban areas based on their demographic size (see Additional file 1 for {{a complete list of}} ports and urban areas). Using quantiles instead of arbitrary thresholds (e.g. over 1 million inhabitants) avoided the possible bias caused by the general increase of city sizes over time, and therefore the incomparability of city-systems from one period to the other. Quantiles depend on different population thresholds between 1950 and 1990 but can be compared as each class contains the same proportion of cities, i.e. around 16.7  %. The second approach is the measurement of <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distances</b> (or great-circle distances, i.e. crow’s fly distances taking into account the sphericity of the Earth) for each pair of connected urban areas in the maritime network. Such a measure is very helpful to verify to what extent larger cities connect geographically far-reaching maritime forelands, as it was demonstrated earlier in the case of airports in airline networks (Guimera et al. 2005) and of container ports in liner shipping networks (Ducruet and Zaidi 2012) but only in recent times. Further research may consider using nautical distances in order to better respect the contours of continents and coastlines.|$|R
40|$|Solutions of such navigational {{problems}} as an <b>orthodromic</b> navigation (courses, <b>distances</b> and intermediate points), maximum latitude and a composite navigation with limited latitude as well as, for comparison, a loxodromic navigation (courses, distances) without any simplifications for a sphere, by {{an application of}} solutions of the inverse geodetic problem are presented. An exemplary rigorous, rapid, non-iterative solution of the inverse geodetic problem according to Sodano, {{for any length of}} geodesic, is attached...|$|R
50|$|The great-circle {{distance}} or <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> is {{the shortest}} distance between two points {{on the surface of}} a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior). The distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a straight line between them, but on the sphere there are no straight lines. In spaces with curvature, straight lines are replaced by geodesics. Geodesics on the sphere are circles on the sphere whose centers coincide with the center of the sphere, and are called great circles.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 he {{was awarded}} the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM). David held the {{youngest}} (assisted) solo circumnavigation record for 13 years, from 1996 to 2009. By some accounts he still holds the unofficial record for the youngest solo non-stop assisted circumnavigation. Jessica Watson captured the unofficial youngest age record in May 2010 with an unassisted solo circumnavigation, but her course did not meet the minimum <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> requirement of 21,600 nautical miles set by the WSSRC. Jesse Martin completed a solo non-stop unassisted circumnavigation in 1999, he was 24 days older than Dicks at the completion of Dicks' voyage.|$|E
50|$|The city {{received}} its charter of freedoms in the mid-13th century, {{period in which}} it also built its first city hall and belfry. The manufacturing of cloth was then the main driver of the local economy. Unfortunately, the few defensive walls that the city had were no match {{against the forces of}} Maximilian of Austria, who utterly destroyed the city {{at the end of the}} 15th century. The market hall and Saint Michael church were rebuilt in the year 1500. On the <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> line from the Saint Michael church to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem are located the jubilee column on the Schlossplatz in Stuttgart and the Kokino observatory. Therefore, is the Cross of Lorraine, granted by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, the coat of arms of Roeselare.|$|E
40|$|A hidden {{cache of}} medieval {{weaponry}} {{was discovered in}} Verona in 1915. A strange device found among the weapons has since been regarded as a Middle-Age hanging lantern. Here we suggest a different use as mathematical tool to find the Qibla. The new interpretation has opened up unsuspected and original perspectives {{in the history of}} science: the tool embodies the application of al-Biruni's (973 - 1048) method of "azimuthal equidistant projection", a geodetic theory for map representation that preserves angles and distances. We demonstrate that the tool embeds the rules of spherical trigonometry that provide the <b>orthodromic</b> and lossodromic <b>distances</b> and the azimuth of two points of given latitude and longitude, to within 1 % of the difference between the Spherical Earth model of al-Biruni (radius = 6339. 6. km) and the WGS 84 Ellipsoid. The geometric relationships that allow conversion of geographic coordinates to planar coordinates are equivalent to the practice of fixing an origin for a wind rose and drawing a distance along the azimuth. It represents the missing piece of the puzzle that enables us to interpret middle age Portolan maps as based on the azimuthal equidistant projection scheme of al-Biruni...|$|R

5000|$|Sailing website Sail-World.com {{published}} {{an analysis on}} 3 May 2010 which claimed that the expected rhumb line distance travelled by Watson was 19631.6 nmi km, which was less than the required distance according to the definition set by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), and that the journey was therefore ineligible to claim world record status for round-the-world journeys. The equivalent <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> for Watson's route would be 18582 nmi km. The WSSRC definition states in part [...] "The shortest orthodromic track of the vessel {{must be at least}} 21600 nmi km in length." [...] The analysis suggests that Watson's published distance logs are based on sailed distances, including tacks and strategic weather detours, rather than the shortest orthodromic track between islands and capes as defined. The rule is based on the older rule, followed by current record-holder Jesse Martin, that during a circumnavigation the sailor must pass two points {{on opposite sides of the}} earth (antipodes). For example, if starting in southern England, a place near the start will be opposite to the track near New Zealand. It was replaced by the rule that for world records the shortest orthodromic track must be at least as long as the circumference of the earth (hence 21,600 nautical miles).|$|E

5000|$|Such {{a master}} of his art was {{difficult}} to find even then. However, until the cathedral was finished, there were {{a large number of}} procurators in Šibenik such as the Procurator of the factory of Santa Maria. The Pope in Rome was asked to meet the procurators in Šibenik, but it is not known if they met personally. In 1451, the bishops of Venice became Patriarchs of Venice. Most of the procurators in Šibenik remained anonymous. Their portraits are outside {{on the wall of the}} cathedral. Some of these heads on the facade have a damaged nose, probably due to vandalism. Indeed, until Justinian II this was the expression to discredit the reputation of someone, and so it was necessary that this individuals remained anonymous. They considered that too little for the money spent, so Giorgio altered the plan: he enlarged the cathedral with a side nave and apses, so that the ground plan of the cathedral was in the shape of a cross, and prepared it for the dome, built the presbytery, sanctuary and his masterpiece, the baptistery. [...] Giorgio combined the mentioned artistic trinities of the 6 mentioned locations in the ground plan. St. Saviour as the apses, the city of Šibenik as the Lion Gate vis-a-vis of the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto, Saint John (Trogir cathedral) as the central nave what is also symbolized by an eagle as the John the Evangelist's symbol outside on the wall over the main entrance, the San Marco cathedral in Venice as one side nave and the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople as the other side nave. The extension of the line from the main entrance to the apse shows towards Jerusalem, but as an <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance</b> curve shows towards the obelisk of the Karnak Temple, from where are the sphinxes in the Diocletian's Palace in Split. The description of the Karnak temple by an unknown [...] "Venetian" [...] was brought to Venice in 1589 and is now in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze. The apses are decorated on the outside with various sculptural decorations, including 74 small Renaissance portraits immortalising important contemporaries and figures who had for some reason particularly impressed the architect or that deemed to tight to help foot the bill for the cathedral's construction. The extension of the line from the main entrance to the Lion Gate shows towards the Split Cathedral. Giorgio worked probably on the cathedral up to his death in 1475 and certainly until 1473.|$|E
40|$|Our {{human society}} is {{experiencing}} complex problems nowadays, which require {{large amounts of}} computing resources, fast algorithms and efficient implementations. These real-world problems generate new instances for the classical, academic problems {{as well as new}} data collections {{that can be used for}} assessing the available solving packages. This paper focuses on the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems, with many variants and broad applications. In order to allow a smooth integration with the current Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, the instances described in this work are specified by geographic coordinates, and they use the <b>orthodromic</b> <b>distance.</b> A sequence of similar instances is defined, and the characteristics of the state-of-the-art exact solver results on these instances are presented and discussed...|$|E
