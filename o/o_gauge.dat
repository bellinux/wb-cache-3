25|$|As <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s it also started to regain manufacturers, and as of late 2003, no fewer than six companies market <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> locomotives and/or cars, all theoretically interoperable with one another.|$|E
25|$|While 1:48 {{is a very}} {{convenient}} {{scale for}} modeling using the Imperial system (a quarter-inch equals one scale foot), the discrepancy between <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in the United States and <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in Europe is attributed to Lionel misreading the original Märklin specifications.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{manufacturers}} {{such as the}} Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> {{for their}} budget line, marketing either Gauge 1 or 'Wide gauge' (also known as 'standard gauge') as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation's most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 inches apart. The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> was the standard, almost by default.|$|E
25|$|A {{situation}} {{similar to}} that in Britain exists in continental Europe, although the market revolves less around kits and more around expensive hand-built metal models for the deep-pocketed collector. Additionally, Czech Republic-based Electric Train Systems started manufacturing and selling lithographed tin 1:45 scale trains in 1991, citing <b>O</b> <b>gauge's</b> advantages over smaller sizes for non-permanent floor layouts and outdoor layouts. The Spanish company Paya produces a smaller line of tinplate trains, based on designs dating back to 1906.|$|R

25|$|From <b>O</b> <b>gauge's</b> {{beginnings}} {{up until}} the mid-1970s, the various manufacturers' trackside accessories would interoperate with one another, but the train cars themselves used couplers of differing designs, often making it difficult or impossible to use different manufacturers' cars together. The post-War consolidation did little to improve matters: Marx used three different standards, {{depending on the product}} line, and Lionel used two, so frequently the companies' own entry-level products were incompatible with their high-end products, let alone with the competition. Hobbyists who wanted differing standards to interoperate had to resort to replacing couplers.|$|R
25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, O gauge's popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains {{and for a while}} a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> Diesel locomotives.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1947 by Albert M. Mercer, K.

We test this proposal by comparing the 6 d half-BPS index to the Higgs branch Hilbert series of the 4 d theory.

25|$|The product widely {{credited}} with saving {{the company was}} a wind-up handcar featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse that operated on <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> track and sold for $1. Lionel manufactured 250,000 units but was still unable {{to keep up with}} demand. At a wholesale price of 55 cents, the handcar's sales would not have provided enough profit to pay off Lionel's debts of $300,000; however, it provided much-needed cash. Lionel avoided bankruptcy and emerged from receivership the next year. By 1939, Lionel had discontinued its standard gauge products, concentrating instead on the more-affordable <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> and OO gauge, which it had introduced in 1938.|$|E
50|$|The American Flyer {{brand name}} survives today under the {{guidance}} of Lionel, LLC, although Lionel's advertising and marketing emphasis seems to remain locked on promoting its own <b>O</b> and O27 <b>gauge</b> product lines. True American Flyer aficionados claim this narrow focus is a conflict of interest and prevents the growth of S Gauge among new train operators. Most of the American Flyer-branded product sold by Lionel, LLC today is reissues of 1950s designs utilizing refurbished old Gilbert tooling, decorated in traditional road names and paint schemes used by Gilbert, as well as an influx of some of today's modern railroad heralds. One complaint by longtime American Flyer devotees is that Lionel isn't creating Flyer products that appeal to the toy train masses—rather, focusing instead on a small market of Flyer collectors.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a technique for cannulating the rete testis permitted con-tinuous collection of spermatozoa and fluid from the testis of conscious rams for up to 5 months (Voglmayr, Scott, Setchell & Waites, 1967; Voglmayr, 1970). When this technique was employed on bulls, the flow of rete testis fluid began to decline 4 to 5 days after surgery and ceased by Day 11 (Voglmayr, Larsen & White, 1970). Histological examination revealed that fibrous tissue had blocked the orifice of the catheter (J. K. Voglmayr, unpublished observations). Early cessation of flow was unusual in rams even if several attempts were required to insert the flexible catheter into the rete testis (J. K. Voglmayr, unpublished observations). This paper describes a modified technique for cannulating the bull rete testis using an instrument designed to minimize tissue damage and to facilitate insertion of the catheter. The instrument, termed a 'catheter holder', was made from seamless, stain¬ less steel tubing (1 - 168 mm i. d., 1 - 651 mm <b>o.</b> d.; 16 <b>gauge</b> needle) by milling a slit (LS, 0 - 6 mm wide) along its entire length of 4 cm and a short slit (SS...|$|R

40|$|Two recent {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that amino acids or amino acid precursors are generated when astrophysical ice analogs are subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding the complete phenomenology of photoprocessing is critical to elucidating chemical reaction mechanisms that can function within an ice matrix under very cold conditions. Pushing beyond the much better characterized study of photolytic dissociation of chemical bonds through electronic excitation, this work explored the ability of UV radiation present in the interstellar medium to ionize small molecules embedded in ices. Quantum chemical calculations, including bulk solvation effects, were used to study the ionization of hydrogen (H 2), water, and methanol (CH 3 OH) bound in small clusters of water. Ionization potentials were found to be much smaller in the condensed phase than in the gas phase; even a small cluster can account for large changes in the ionization potentials in ice, as well as the known formation of an OH [...] H 3 O+ pair in the case of H 2 <b>O</b> photoionization. To <b>gauge</b> the impact of photoionization on subsequent grain chemistry, the reaction between OH and CO in the presence of H 3 O+ was studied and compared with the potential energy surface without hydronium present, which is relevant to chemistry following photolysis.
