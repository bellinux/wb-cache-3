Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E

In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance.

5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book.

Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
5|$|A violent multiple-vortex tornado struck {{portions}} of extreme northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee during the mid-evening hours of April 27. It touched down along Davis Ridge Road in Catoosa County, Georgia, and {{moved through the}} town of Ringgold at EF3 strength, destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Baymont Inn & Suites, located near Interstate 75 was partially destroyed by the tornado, along with a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and several gas stations located on Highway 151 in Ringgold at the Interstate 75 interchange (exit 348). The Catoosa County Department <b>of</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> Children Services and other businesses on Nashville Street in downtown Ringgold were also heavily damaged. The Kellerhals Center for Visual Arts Education at Ringgold High School was destroyed (RHS itself had minor damage), and Ringgold Middle School was heavily damaged. Past downtown Ringgold, the tornado reached EF4 intensity as it tore through a subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road at the north edge of town. Twelve homes were completely obliterated and swept away at that location (though they were not well-built). There were 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage {{for a total of}} 252 affected structures in the Ringgold area. Eight people were killed, mainly at the subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road.|$|E

5|$|Blue Alert warnings, which {{indicate}} that a cyclone may affect the warning area within 48hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were upgraded to a Yellow Alert– an indication that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect the warning area in 12hours– at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert– meaning the cyclone is imminent– at 8 pm. In general, residents were well informed of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated to homes in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department <b>of</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> Children's Services. 280people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as The Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind <b>of</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>and</b> {{household}} {{structure in}} Norway {{in the period}} of 2005 - 2016 Abstract The main aim of the bachelor work is to describe the structure <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households in Norway in the period 2005 - 2016 regard to the population development in Norway and data from the Norwegian Statistical Office related to <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households. The partial aim of the thesis is to compare the structure <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households in Norway with selected European countries in 2001 and 2011 based on the values of the standardized index of household heads, calculated from the Demographic Yearbook's data. The analysis shows that the structure <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households in Norway differs significantly from the structure <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households in the countries of southern and eastern Europe. A more similar structure <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> households to the structure of Norway have some countries of central Europe, and the most similar is structure of countries in northern Europe. The propensity to found own household for Norwegian men and women is one of the highest among the surveyed countries, but the value of the standardized index of household heads for women in Norway related to the standard is higher than for men as in most of the analyzed states. The results of analysis suggest that there is an intensive spread of cohabitation [...] ...|$|R
