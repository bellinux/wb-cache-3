In particular, Fitting's (and Anderson's) variant of the ontological argument is verified and confirmed. This variant avoids the modal collapse, which has been criticised as an undesirable side-effect of Kurt Gödel's (and Dana Scott's) versions of the ontological argument. <b>Fitting's</b> <b>work</b> is employing an intensional higher-order modal logic, which we shallowly embed here in classical higher-order logic.

50|$|A loose {{motivation}} {{for much of}} Melvin <b>Fitting's</b> <b>work</b> can be formulated succinctly as follows. There are many logics. Our principles of reasoning vary with context and subject matter. Multiplicity {{is one of the}} glories of modern formal logic. The common thread tying logics together is a concern for what can be said (syntax), what that means (semantics), and relationships between the two. A philosophical position that can be embodied in a formal logic {{has been shown to be}} coherent, not correct. Logic is a tool, not a master, but it is an enjoyable tool to use.|$|R

This work briefly describes the mathematics behind the algorithm, and also elaborates how to implement it using FORTRAN 95 programming language. The advantage of this algorithm, when it is extended to surfaces and complex functions, is that it makes researchers to have a better trust during fitting. It also improves the generalization and predictive performance of 2 D and 3 D real and complex functions...|$|R
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick connect fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression <b>fittings</b> <b>work,</b> but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reveal the {{economic}} effect and management effect in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the theoretic model of technological innovation engineering is given in the paper. By model design, pre-test and pilot test, reliability test and validity test, factor analysis can effectively reveal the correlation among innovation planning, innovation implementation, innovation platform and innovation performance. For illustration, 245 questionnaires return from 11 provinces and autonomous regions, and the returns ratio is 70 %, which satisfy the requirement that the questionnaire returns-ratio is not lower than 20 % in the data investigation. The empirical results show that model <b>fitting</b> <b>work</b> well, and have high convergence validity. The research conclusions provide a realistic theory reference for SMEs-related technology innovation engineering in China...|$|R

For this reason ensuring of <b>fitting</b> <b>work</b> and sustained workability should be an aspect of health policy.

Under certain preconditions (e. g. on a voluntary basis, confidentiality, integration with health protection) lifestyle interventions during work time can contribute to a healthier working population. As such programmes may result in financial and social benefits for employers, they should be partly responsible for paying the costs.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{large scale}} quantum mechanical NMR simulations and <b>fitting</b> <b>works,</b> and deals with biomolecular spin systems. Chapter one introduces the theoretical background that underpins the simulation work. It describes spin and it properties, {{the interactions of}} spin with the magnetic field, the environment and it self and the Hamiltonians that describe those interactions. It also covers the Bloch equations that is normally used to predict the longitudinal and transverse relaxations. It further briefly describes the common relaxation mechanisms that are available for a spin system. It also included NMR experiments that are often {{used in the study}} of protein and nucleic acid systems. Chapter 2 summarizes the building of J-coupling predictor function. It provides the detail on how the estimator function was built. The function is required for NMR simulations and incorporates the functionality of J-coupling estimation, which provides J-coupling values for proteins and nucleic acids. After building the estimator function NOESY spectra simulation of ubiquitin and RNA stem loops spin systems was performed. Chapter 3 then discusses our simulation method, treating the system quantum mechanically along with an advanced and detailed description of NOE using Redfield relaxation theory. Chapter 4 reports on large–scale simulations and fitting of an exchanging 1 H- 15 N HSQC spectra of calmodulin (PDB: 1 CLL) upon stepwise addition of a ligand, that was analysed using a iii formalism that operates in the direct product of spin state space and chemical state space. It also presents the least squares technique for the fitting procedure and the Nelder-Mead simplex minimization technique used in the process. The chapter also highlights the data collated from the <b>fitting</b> <b>work.</b> Finally, chapter 5 concludes the thesis with the simulation of NOESY stem loops RNA spin system and fitting with respect to correlation time and frequency offset. It also explains how we fitted the data from theory to those from the experiment and why the diagonal peaks were eliminated from the fitting...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about fitting {{a model for}} the {{spreading}} of a computer virus to measured data, contributing not only the fitted model, but equally important, an account of the process of getting there. Over the last years, there has been an increased interest in epidemic models to study the speed of virus spread. But parameterising such models is hard, because due to the unexpected nature of real outbreaks, there is not much solid measurement data available, and the data may often have imperfections. We propose a mean-field model for computer virus spread, and use parameter fitting techniques to set the model's parameter values based on measured data. We discuss a number of steps that had to be taken to make the <b>fitting</b> <b>work,</b> including preprocessing and interpreting the measurement data, and restructuring the model based on the available data. We show that the resulting parameterised model closely mimics real system behaviour, with a relative squared error of 0. 7 %...|$|R

It was not until 1911 that they made a serious attempt to enter what was now a growing market. The Burrell wagons generally followed the design followed by market leader Fodens of Sandbach and several revisions were produce when Fodens had established an improved design. Overall the company produced around 120 overtype steam wagons between 1911 and 1928. Two wagons supplied were fitted with a dynamo and full showmans <b>fittings,</b> <b>works</b> numbers 3843 [...] "The Lion" [...] and 3883 [...] "Electra", in 1939 this second wagon was totally destroyed in a Nazi bombing raid over Plymouth.

40|$|The Tismana {{river basin}} {{is located in}} the South-West of Romania, {{collecting}} its waters mainly from the South-West of Vâlcan mountains and, to a smaller extent, from the Tismana depression, being known for the variety of hydrotechnical works executed on it, having a complex hydrotechnical fitting. Tismana river does not have a natural flow regime because it benefits from an input of water from the water collections on the Cerna river, transferred in Motru river and, after that, in Tismana river, but also from the water coming from the Clocotiş accumulation on Bistriţa river. The only permanent accumulation on Tismana river (Tismana accumulation) was commissioned in 1983, with a hydropower purpose, taking over the turbined waters from Tismana CHE. Thus, the commissioning of the Cerna-Motru-Tismana hydropower system and, subsequently, of the Bistriţa-Tismana hydropower system, has had effects on the natural regime of water flow in Tismana river.
