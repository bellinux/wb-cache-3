5000|$|A Scottish {{population}} based {{study of}} 4062 patients identified at 3 months postop an incidence of 43% mild pain and 3% <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain. The severe and very severe group {{was associated with}} young age and female gender. A further survey of the 3% severe pain cohort (at a median of 30 months) found that 29% resolved, 39% improved and 26% continued with <b>severe,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain.|$|R
30|$|Survival has {{dramatically}} improved in SAA because of advances in {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT), pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in recent decades [27]. According to guidelines for management of aplastic anemia, allogeneic HSCT from a matched sibling donor is the initial treatment of choice for newly diagnosed patients if they have <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> aplastic anemia, are <[*] 40  years old and a matched sibling donor [13, 15]. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is recommended for (i) patients with non-severe aplastic anemia who are transfusion dependent (ii) patients with <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> disease who are >[*] 40  years old and (iii) younger patients with <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> disease {{who do not have}} a matched sibling donor. The standard immunosuppressive regimen is a combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine. Approximately 30 % of patients with SAA are refractory to IST and suffer from persistent, severe cytopenia and deficits in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells [15].|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} predictors of grades of disability at least 1 year after stroke rehabilitation therapy. We recruited stroke patients from the inpatient rehabilitation department of a university hospital. The degree of disability was graded using the disability evaluation at least 1 year after stroke onset. Functional ability was evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure instrument on admission, on discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation program, and at the 6 -month follow-up visit after discharge. Major sociodemographic, medical, and rehabilitative factors were also collected during the hospitalization period. Of the 109 patients surveyed, 64 (58. 7 %) had <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> grades of disability. The correlates of <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> disability in logistic regression analyses were bilaterally affected (odds ratio, OR, 10. 8), impaired orientation (OR, 3. 6), and poorer functional ability at discharge (OR, 7. 6). Based on the significant predictors identified, the logistic regression model correctly classified <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> disability in 68. 0 % of subjects. The higher frequency of <b>severe</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> disability in this study may have been due to the relatively more severely affected stroke patient population in the inpatient rehabilitation service and the use of unique disability evaluation criteria. These results may provide information useful in planning continuous rehabilitation care and setting relevant socio-welfare policies for stroke victims. <br /...|$|R
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Globally, acne affects {{approximately}} 650million people, {{or about}} 9.4% of the population, as of 2010. It affects nearly 90% {{of people in}} Western societies during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. While acne that first develops {{between the ages of}} 21 and 25 is uncommon, it affects 54% of women and 40% of men older than 25years of age, and has a lifetime prevalence of 85%. About 20% of those affected have moderate <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> cases. It is slightly more common in females than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). In those over 40years old, 1% of males and 5% of females still have problems.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{association}} between self-reported noncancer pain and 5 -year mortality. DESIGN: Cohort. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults. PARTICIPANTS: Canadian Study of Health and Aging 1996 wave. MEASUREMENTS: Registrar of Vital Statistics-established 5 -year mortality. Noncancer pain was assessed using the 5 -point verbal descriptor scale, dichotomized into no or very mild versus moderate, <b>severe,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain. Frailty was the accumulation of health deficits. Cognitive status (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) and depressed mood (five-item mental health screening questionnaire) were also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between pain and 5 -year mortality. RESULTS: Of 5, 703 participants, 4, 694 (82. 3 %) had complete data for analysis; 1, 663 of these (35. 4 %) reported moderate, <b>severe,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain, and 1, 343 (28. 6 %) had died at 5 -year follow-up. Four hundred ninety-six of those who died (29. 8 %) reported moderate, <b>severe,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain and 847 (27. 9 %) no or very mild pain. Multivariate logistic analysis found that individuals with moderate, <b>severe,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>severe</b> pain had lower odds of 5 -year mortality than those with no or very mild pain (odds ratio= 0. 78, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 66 - 0. 92; P CONCLUSION: Older women with pain were less likely to die within 5 years than older women without pain, men in pain, or men without pain...|$|R

5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} {{usually requires}} {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that, as of 2010, 880,000 deaths {{occur as}} a result of self-harm. About 10% of admissions to medical wards in the UK are {{as a result of}} self-harm, the majority of which are drug overdoses. However, studies based only on hospital admissions may hide the larger group of self-harmers who do not need or seek hospital treatment for their injuries, instead treating themselves. Many adolescents who present to general hospitals with deliberate self-harm report previous episodes for which they did not receive medical attention. In the United States up to 4% of adults self-harm with approximately 1% of the population engaging in chronic <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> self-harm.|$|E

Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood control reservoirs, but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> drought. A low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. This portion of the river is known as Zink Lake.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective.

5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the first}} Eastern Pacific major {{hurricane}} since Hurricane Kenna in 2002. The sixth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Darby developed from a tropical wave {{that emerged from the}} west coast of Africa on July 12. After crossing into the Eastern Pacific, the storm became a tropical depression on June 26. The system steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on 000 UTC July 28. Darby peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, though it quickly deteriorated due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear. While Darby dissipated on August 1, the remnants of the tropical cyclone affected the Hawaiian Islands. The system produced high waves and heavy rainfall that led to extensive flash flooding. Numerous roads were closed, while minor landslides and rockslides were reported. Despite the effects, no fatalities <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> damages occurred.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) <b>or</b> <b>severe</b> (greater than 6mm loss).
