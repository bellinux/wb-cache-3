The Super Hornet is larger than the [...] "classic" [...] McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet operated by the RAAF, carries more ordnance, and has a greater fuel capacity. It is fitted with a 20mm cannon and can be armed with air-to-air and anti-shipping missiles, as well as a variety of air-to-ground bombs and missiles. Flown by a crew of two, a pilot and an air combat officer (ACO), it is capable of engaging targets in the air and on the surface simultaneously. It can be refuelled in flight by the RAAF's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports. The Super Hornets are serviced at the <b>operating</b> <b>level</b> by No.1 Squadron technical staff; heavier maintenance is conducted by Boeing Defence Australia and other contractors.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Cervical disc {{prostheses}} induce {{significant amount}} of artifact in magnetic resonance imaging which may complicate radiologic follow-up after surgery. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate as to what extent the artifact, induced by the frequently used Discover® cervical disc prosthesis, impedes interpretation of the MR images at <b>operated</b> and adjacent <b>levels</b> in 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR. Methods Ten subsequent patients were investigated in both 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR with standard image sequences one year following anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty. Outcome measures Two neuroradiologists evaluated the images by consensus. Emphasis was made on signal changes in medulla at all levels and visualization of root canals at <b>operated</b> and adjacent <b>levels.</b> A “blur artifact ratio” was calculated and defined as the height of the artifact on T 1 sagittal images related to the <b>operated</b> <b>level.</b> Results The artifacts induced in 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR were of entirely different character and evaluation of the spinal cord at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> was impossible in both magnets. Artifacts also made the root canals difficult to assess at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> and more pronounced in the 3 Tesla MR. At the adjacent levels however, the spinal cord and root canals were completely visualized in all patients. The “blur artifact” induced at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> was also more pronounced in the 3 Tesla MR. Conclusions The artifact induced by the Discover® titanium disc prosthesis in both 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR, makes interpretation of the spinal cord impossible and visualization of the root canals difficult at <b>operated</b> <b>level.</b> Adjusting the MR sequences to produce the least amount of artifact is important. © The Author(s) 2013 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a least cost method of operating {{a power plant}} in view of variable spot price of electricity and load demand greater than plant capacity. Manager of an industrial power plant has to operate its generators at appropriate <b>operating</b> <b>levels.</b> Furthermore, manager has {{to put up a}} demand bid to a power exchange in order to cover the remaining load demand such that overall cost remains minimal. Fuel consumption data of three generators has been used in this paper to determine generators <b>operating</b> <b>levels</b> and a demand bid over a range of spot prices. Our results demonstrate that electricity trading through a power exchange leads to considerable savings when spot price drops below fixed price...|$|R
40|$|The study {{included}} {{a group of}} anterior cervical microdiscectomy without fusion performed at one level (either C 5 -C 6 level or at the C 6 -C 7 level) and a second group of patients with same single-level of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion. The kinematic analysis included the range of motion, anteroposterior translation and disc height assessed for the cervical functional spinal units at the <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> and adjacent <b>levels.</b> At the <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> the range of motion and the translation were minimal in the anterior cervical discectomy without fusion group, both for the C 5 -C 6 and C 6 -C 7 levels, and absent in the cervical discectomy with fusion group. The superior adjacent levels translations were greater in the ACDF group compared with the ACD group. The clinical results of both types of cervical discectomy were comparable. In cervical microdiscectomy without fusion the elastic fibrous intradiscal scar at the <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> allows a small degree of mobility and the adjacent cervical levels are not overstressed. No need for anterior cervical discectomy with fusion to trait a single level cervical disc herniation than in selected cases...|$|R
30|$|CDDDs {{can result}} in arm and neck pain, walking {{instability}} {{or a combination of}} symptoms which included myelopathy and radiculopathy. When symptoms do not respond to conservative treatment, operative treatment is considered. ACDF is an effective treatment for patients with symptomatic CDDDs (Bohlman et al. 1993). It has been performed for about 50  years. However, the loss of motion at the <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> can increase motion at the adjacent levels. ASD emerges gradually as a common complication. The original design purpose of CDA is to maintain the motion of <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> (DiAngelo et al. 2003). The technique is to restore and maintain the original biomechanics of cervical spine, which is attempted to prevent adjacent level degeneration at the operated segments. However, controversy still surrounds regarding whether CDA is better than ACDF.|$|R

We report a case, with 5 year followup, who underwent ACDF from C 5 to C 7 for cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

He started developing progressive neck pain and myelopathy after 3 months and investigations revealed spondylodiscitis at C 3 and C 4 with erosion, collapse, and kyphosis, without any evidence of implant failure or graft rejection at the <b>operated</b> <b>level.</b> He underwent reexploration and implant removal at the <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> (there was good fusion from C 5 to C 7) followed by debridement/decompression at C 3, C 4 along with iliac crest bone grafting and stabilization with plate and screws after maximum correction of kyphosis.

He was under regular followup for 5 years his myelopathy resolved completely and he is back to work.
