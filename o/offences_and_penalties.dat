40|$|The {{principle}} of proportionality prescribes that the punishment should equal the crime. It {{is one of the}} most important principles of sentencing. Yet, despite its widespread acceptance it offers no meaningful guide to sentencing. Hence penalty levels fluctuate greatly between jurisdictions and within jurisdictions. This is because there is no universally agreed criterion for measuring offence seriousness or penalty severity. This article suggests that the appropriate criteria for matching <b>offence</b> seriousness <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> severity is the level of unhappiness or pain stemming from each of these impositions. Thus, for example, the level of pain meted out to a rape offender should equal the level of pain caused to a rape victim. Emerging scientific studies on human well-being and happiness show that human beings are similarly built in terms of the experiences that are either conducive or inimical to well-being. This commonality provides a strong foundation to be confident to make reasonably accurate predictions concerning the extent to which adverse events, such as being the victim of a criminal offence or subjected to a form of criminal sanction will stifle human flourishing. This will then allow us to match accurately <b>offence</b> seriousness <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> level...|$|R

The review looks at whether current regulations will improve these outcomes and support drug policy goals.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008 The {{growth of}} {{industrialization}} has increased waste pollution, especially water pollution. Industries and individuals produce pollutants that are discharged into waters. Uncontrolled water pollution results in health hazards to human beings, animals and other living things. Thus {{there is a}} need to impose water pollution control measures which can reduce pollution to an extent where very little pollutants are discharged into waters. Many states have enacted statutes for controlling water pollution, as they believe this is the best way to impose measures to achieve the safety of waters. Legislations impose measures, such as a permit and its conditions, that must be respected to discharge pollutant or trade effluent into waters, otherwise the discharger becomes a polluter and liable to criminal sanctions. Statutes create <b>offences</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for water polluters. They provide fines or imprisonment, or both, and severely punish a subsequent offender. In most countries, a continuing offence is criminalised. Corporations, as well as corporate officers, are punished for the offence of polluting waters or other environmental crimes. This is because environmental law does not allow corporate officers to hide behind the legal structure of the corporation. Some measures such as remediation or clean-up orders are implemented before a prosecution is engaged, in order to ensure the protection of the environment. Environmental audit or service orders emphasise the protection of the environment and may prevent future pollution of waters. Environmental service orders rectify one of the criticisms of fine or imprisonment, in that they fail to restore the environment to its previous condition. Most environmental crimes are caused not by a deliberate intention or negligence, but by poor or ineffective management systems. As a result, environmental audit orders may be used to detect and correct an inappropriate management system. Environmental law should be a user-friendly and prosecution must be used as a last resort. This dissertation examines <b>offences</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for water pollution in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia and offers a comparative analysis and recommendations for South Africa. These countries have been selected not only because they are developed and tend to have best laws, but they are also located in different continents. The examination and analysis of how they provide <b>offences</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for water pollution gives a chance to South Africa to find recommendations on how it may improve its legislation and maintain its water quality...|$|E

On the other hand, we sought to highlight the mechanisms used for the ascertainment of offences and the establishment of the corresponding penalties. For this purpose, we started from the basic concepts related to the offence and penalty problems in the internal audit missions and we continued with their application at practical level in the accomplishment of an actual audit mission. We also tried to highlight the role and place of the offence and of the penalty respectively in the process of exercising the internal audit activity, and also the finality at the level of entities and persons responsible for the improper exercise of the designated actions...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the European Union (EU) Environmental Crime Directive in 2008 marks a significant step in the European Union’s process of integration.

Yet {{there are a number}} of deficiencies in the Directive which may compromise its effective implementation and enforcement by the Member States. Particularly noteworthy is that the Directive does not define specific types and levels of penalties or any rules on prosecution or jurisdiction. This article analyses the main features of the illegal waste management and trafficking <b>offences</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> under the Environmental Crime Directive and surveys the implementation of those offences by specific EU Member States. It aims to make a broader assessment of the consistency and effectiveness of the implementation of the Directive, assessing the implications that it may have on the enforcement of environmental law in the Member States...|$|E
