He {{was arrested for}} breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck {{with a glass of}} ice. Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media because of his sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> honesty.|$|E

Critics {{approved of the}} blend <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> adventure in the film.

5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E

5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Europe on August 16, 2012 and in North America the following day. The Expendables 2 grossed over $310million worldwide, with its greatest success outside North America. Critics generally considered the film an improvement over its predecessor (citing an increased use <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> action scenes), but its plot and dialogue received negative reviews. A tie-in downloadable video game was released on July 31, 2012 as a prequel {{to the events of}} the film. A sequel, The Expendables 3, was released on August 15, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Waxworks {{impressed}} Carl Laemmle, the German-born {{president of}} Universal Pictures. Laemmle {{was struck by}} Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> playfulness during grotesque scenes. Meanwhile, in the United States, D. W. Griffith's One Exciting Night (1922) began a Gothic horror film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like Alfred E. Green's now lost The Ghost Breaker (1922), Frank Tuttle's Puritan Passions (1923), Roland West's The Monster (1925) and The Bat (1926), and Alfred Santell's The Gorilla (1927)—all comedy horror film adaptations of Broadway stage plays—proved successful.|$|E

5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with women when first joining the show.|$|E

25|$|Both games {{received}} generally positive reviews {{across all}} platforms. MDK was praised for its gameplay, level design, sardonic sense <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> technical accomplishments.

MDK2 received praise for its graphics, gameplay styles, level design, boss fights, sense <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> fidelity to the original. The most commonly criticized aspects of the game were the difficulty level and the platforming sections. In 2007, Interplay announced plans for a third game, but it was never made.|$|E

40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that sensation seeking (SS) is able to predict both the structure and content of jokes and cartoons. Five hypotheses were derived and tested in two samples from Spain and Germany comprising a total of 434 participants. The basic pattern of correlations was replicated for the two samples, and for the different measures <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> appreciation (3 -WD, EAHU) and sensation seeking (AISS, SSS). Experience Seeking and Novelty were predictive of low appreciation <b>of</b> incongruity-resolution <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> high appreciation <b>of</b> nonsense <b>humor.</b> Disinhibition <b>and</b> Intensity were positively correlated with funniness of sexual, black, man-disparagement <b>and</b> woman-disparagement <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> negatively with their aversiveness. When the structure variance from the content categories was removed, the correlations between appreciation <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> contents <b>and</b> sensation seeking increased. This confirmed that structure and content have to be separated both theoretically and empirically in studies of appreciation of content categorie...|$|R

25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style {{might be}} called naïve art, but his works differs from most naïve artists' due to the {{influence}} of ethnographic patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion of a sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> personality. His scenes can provide subtle hints of attitudes and personalities of individual people and often include whimsical details on the periphery that contrast with the central activities.|$|E

50|$|Breton {{coined the}} term for his book Anthology <b>of</b> Black <b>Humor</b> (Anthologie de l'humour noir), in which he {{credited}} Jonathan Swift as the originator <b>of</b> black <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> gallows <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> included excerpts from 45 other writers. Breton included both examples in which the wit arises from a victim with which the audience empathizes, as is more typical in the tradition <b>of</b> gallows <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> examples in which the comedy is used to mock the victim. This victim's suffering is trivialized, which leads to sympathizing with the victimizer, as analogously found in the social commentary and social criticism of the writings <b>of</b> Sade. Black <b>humor</b> is also occasionally related {{to that of the}} grotesque genre.|$|R
25|$|Advisors {{suggest that}} the essay should be concise, honest (with no embellishments), coherent, not boring, accurate, evoking vivid images, {{revealing}} a likeable and smart individual, with cautious use <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> possibly touching on controversial topics but in a balanced way.
