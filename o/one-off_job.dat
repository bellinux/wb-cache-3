While attempting to deliver ten stolen wheelchairs worth $1200 each, the duo lose the merchandise in a police chase. They are sentenced to 5000 hours of community service. Then they are told they have 24 hours to pay $12,000 to cover the loss or they will be shot dead.

5000|$|The term [...] "job" [...] has a {{traditional}} meaning as [...] "piece of work", from Middle English [...] "jobbe of work", {{and is used}} as such in manufacturing, in the phrase [...] "job production", meaning [...] "custom production", where it is contrasted with batch production (many items at once, {{one step at a}} time) and flow production (many items at once, all steps at the same time, by item). Note that these distinctions have become blurred in computing, where the oxymoronic term [...] "batch job" [...] is found, and used either for a <b>one-off</b> <b>job</b> or for a round of [...] "batch processing" [...] (same processing step applied to many items at once, originally punch cards).|$|E
30|$|Internships realise many {{benefits}} for all stakeholders, {{in a field}} where occupation-specific skills are critical. For employers, internships provide access to a pool of workers who are academically-trained at a low cost (Beggs et al. 2008), typically enthusiastic and dedicated to the industry, and bring fresh ideas to the workplace (Walo 2001), thus helping to avoid staff turnover (Fell and Kuit 2003). Internships also provide employers with opportunities to screen potential employees prior to making long-term commitments, and to have direct involvement in training future managers (Ju et al. 1998; Petrillose and Montgomery 1997). Employer recruitment processes are facilitated through internships by providing a more in-depth assessment of potential employees working as interns than via <b>one-off</b> <b>job</b> interviews (Yiu and Law 2012). Research indicates that interns who undertake graduate positions with the company with whom they completed their internship exhibit greater job satisfaction and more realistic expectations grounded in their experience (Hiltebeitel et al. 2000).|$|E

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, {{interactive}} computing such as via text-based computer terminal interfaces (as in Unix shells or read-eval-print loops), and later {{graphical user interfaces}} became common. Non-interactive computation, both <b>one-off</b> <b>jobs</b> such as compilation, and processing of multiple items in batches, became retrospectively referred to as batch processing, and the oxymoronic term batch job (in early use often [...] "batch of jobs") became common. Early use is particularly found at the University of Michigan, around the Michigan Terminal System (MTS); examples from 1968 and 1969: ...|$|R

50|$|On September 5, 1950, Douglas Seaman {{purchased}} Western Welding & Manufacturing, a small {{machine shop}} in Milwaukee that {{was founded in}} 1943. Western mainly handled small, <b>one-off</b> welding <b>jobs</b> for large manufacturers. A friend suggested to Seaman that he should start manufacturing snowplows {{as a way to}} diversify his business, which he did. In 1952, Western Welding introduced its first snowplow {{at a time when the}} U.S. population was shifting toward suburb settings, which increased the market for light trucks. This increased the demand for snowplows.|$|R
50|$|Phang {{has taken}} <b>one-off</b> {{directing}} <b>jobs</b> on episodic series television, most notably for a Season 1 episode of The Exorcist on Fox. She remarks {{that it is}} interesting to work in an established universe with characters already defined, and to direct a wide variety of actors who are already familiar with their characters. She particularly notes that it is a challenge to learn whether the showrunner wants her to work within the parameters of the series, or to add personal touches that give the series a new spin. In her opinion, TV directing work, in addition to the extra income, improves her versatility and adaptability in her film projects.|$|R
5000|$|It was Barrow's idea to {{give out}} Beatles Christmas {{greetings}} to their fan club members. Barrow thought this goodwill gesture might limit {{the damage done to}} the group's reputation by delays in replying to an ever-increasing volume of fan mail. The Beatles were three weeks behind in answering membership applications. At the time he said facetiously that he thought of how the Queen always sent out yuletide greetings to her subjects every year on UK radio and TV, and he decided that the Beatles should [...] "follow her fine example but in their own way". All members of the group's official fan club would receive an exclusive flexi-disc carrying messages from John, Paul, George and Ringo. What started as a <b>one-off</b> damage limitation <b>job</b> grew into an eagerly anticipated annual event.|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{a search}} {{model of the}} labour market in which firms and workers meet bilaterally and {{negotiate}} over wages {{in the presence of}} private information. We show that a fall in labour market frictions induces more aggressive wage bargaining behaviour, which in turn leads to a costly increase in job insecurity. This adverse insecurity effect can be so large that firms and workers who are in an employment relationship can be made worse off by a fall in labour market frictions. In contrast, firms and workers who are not in an employment relationship and are searching the market for a counterpart are always made better off by such a fall in labour market frictions. We then endogenize the organizational structure of the employment relationship and show that a fall in labour market frictions induces a one-off reorganization in which firms and workers switch from a rigid employment relationship to a flexible one. This reorganization leads to a large, <b>one-off</b> increase in <b>job</b> insecurity and unemployment. flexibility of employment relationships; job insecurity; private information...|$|R
