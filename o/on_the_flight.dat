5|$|All 92people {{on board}} were killed, {{including}} David Angell (the creator {{and executive producer}} of the television sitcom Frasier), his wife Lynn Angell, and actress Berry Berenson, the widow of Anthony Perkins. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane had been scheduled to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> but arrived at the airport late. Actor Mark Wahlberg was also scheduled to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> but canceled his ticket at the last minute. Actress Leighanne Littrell, wife of Backstreet Boys singer Brian Littrell, had also previously been booked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> but like Wahlberg, changed her plans at the last minute.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{service members}} {{continued}} the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was listed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized the name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> log, and ended the charade.|$|E
5|$|At 5:31 pm Japan Standard Time (0831UTC) on October27, a Japan Airlines Boeing 767-300 {{heading to}} Narita International Airport, {{encountered}} severe turbulence from Faxai about 74km (46mi) southeast of Narita. The turbulence caused seven injuries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> {{as well as}} some damage to the plane.|$|E
50|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> second <b>flight,</b> no {{medication}} was given. Seventy-one {{percent of}} those who received alprazolam <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>flight</b> experienced panic as compared with only 29% of those who received a placebo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>flight.</b> This suggests that the participants who were not medicated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>flight</b> benefited from <b>the</b> experience via some degree of desensitization.|$|R
3000|$|... the {{decision}} making process of Air 1 is mostly impacted by the operating profitability criterion, and <b>the</b> ticket prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> out-bound <b>flight</b> are higher (by around 35  %) as well as number of these high-fare passengers than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> in-bound <b>flight.</b> This will accordingly lead to {{the decision}} solution not waiting, since the ticket revenue gained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> departing <b>flight</b> is higher than <b>the</b> one gained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arriving <b>flight.</b>|$|R

5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|Eagles refit was {{completed}} on 9January 1942 {{and she was}} working up {{for the next five}} weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23February and was assigned to Force H.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-defence}} against enemy warships, Eagle {{had nine}} BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along {{both sides of}} the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.|$|E
50|$|The route was {{originally}} flown by Handley Page HP42s, with two weekly flights landing in Sharjah on Sunday and Wednesday evenings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outbound <b>flight</b> and Wednesday and Saturday evenings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return <b>flight.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{mainstay}} of the Milford route was the Britten Norman Islander which began service in September 1970. They were used extensively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> to Milford Sound as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Queenstown-Te Anau and Queenstown-Alexandra-Dunedin routes.|$|R
25|$|The crash did {{not affect}} bookings for the JFK-Santo Domingo route. Dominicans {{continued}} to book travel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> American Airlines {{announced that it would}} end services between JFK and Santo Domingo on April 1, 2013.|$|R
5|$|Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose {{daughter}} Alice Ephraimson-Abt had died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> chaired the American Association for Families of KAL007 Victims. He single-handedly pursued three U.S. administrations for answers about the flight, flying to Washington 250 times and meeting with 149 State Department officials. Following {{the dissolution of}} the U.S.S.R., Ephraimson-Abt persuaded U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy, Sam Nunn, Carl Levin, and Bill Bradley to write to the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev requesting information about the flight.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Prevented {{from flying}} further combat {{missions}} for propaganda reasons, {{at the age}} of 28 Mölders was appointed Inspector of Fighters. He was inspecting the Luftwaffe units in the Crimea when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of Ernst Udet, a Luftwaffe general and World War I flying ace. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> to Berlin, the aircraft in which he was traveling as a passenger attempted an emergency landing due to an engine failure. It crashed at Breslau, killing Mölders and two others.|$|E

5|$|Ritchie Valens, {{who once}} had a fear of flying, asked Tommy Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to toss a coin to decide. Bob Hale, a DJ with KRIB-AM, was working the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians {{departed}} for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|S.E.5 no. A4850, {{fresh from}} its packing crate, was {{extensively}} modified for Ball: in particular {{he had the}} synchronised Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through {{the floor of the}} cockpit. He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> line, and installing the members of his flight nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 (registration N1819U), {{was delivered}} in 1973 {{and had been}} owned by UAL since then. Before departure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated {{for a total of}} 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles. The airplane was powered by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CF6-6D high bypass ratio turbofan engines.|$|E
50|$|At the {{starting}} line, teams {{had to take}} a mud run obstacle course on a lake shore, grab a ring of tire which contained airplane tickets for their first destination city: Tokyo, Japan for one of two <b>flights.</b> <b>The</b> first eight teams were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>flight,</b> and <b>the</b> last three <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>flight.</b>|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> charter <b>flight</b> {{was only}} for Taiwanese merchants {{returning}} home for the Chinese New Year, {{there would not be}} a demand to travel from Taiwan to Mainland China before the New Year's Day. Neither would there be people needing to travel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> from Mainland China to Taiwan that operated <b>on</b> dates after <b>the</b> New Year period.|$|R
50|$|At first {{students}} from Port Harcourt travelled between school and their homes via buses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads. Rising crime along roads during the 1990s made parents believe that road travel was too dangerous. In 2001, when Sosoliso Airlines began services between Port-Harcourt and Abuja, parents placed their children <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|As on {{most large}} warships, {{there have been}} several {{incidents}} involving the death or injury of one or more crew members, although most have involved freak accidents or failures, such as a man overboard as a result of poor weather. One of the highest-profile incidents was on 26 May 1981, when an EA-6B Prowler crashed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck of Nimitz, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. Forensic testing of the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this in itself was not found to have directly caused the crash, the findings of the investigation prompted the introduction of mandatory drug testing of all service personnel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> {{crew was}} criticised for not {{maintaining}} a sterile cockpit during the landing, with excessive non-flight related discussion going <b>on</b> throughout <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
