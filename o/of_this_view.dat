5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's Constitutional History of England, published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.|$|E
5|$|While {{it was a}} {{minority}} view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous pseudoscientific theories (such {{as that of the}} four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis {{about the nature of the}} mental. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.|$|E

5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E
5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement each other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E

25|$|Additional adherents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> include Rainey, James Dobson, Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical ethicists Franklin E. Payne and John and Paul Feinberg. Although most Protestants {{adhere to}} this view, {{some such as}} Rainey may {{nonetheless}} advocate {{for one of the}} categories he describes, depending upon which Christian values they deem most important.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} aggregative {{democracy}} {{claims that the}} aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt.

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{aesthetics}} concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> occurs in G.H.

25|$|Besides scriptural authority, Jains also {{resorted to}} {{syllogism}} and deductive reasoning to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity {{and the universe}} held by the Vedics, samkhyas, mīmāṃsās, Buddhists and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain Ācāryas. However, the most eloquent refutation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> is provided by Ācārya Jinasena in Mahāpurāna, which was quoted by Carl Sagan in his book Cosmos.|$|E
25|$|Opponents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> {{observe that}} the {{religion}} of the Torah seems different from Atenism in everything except the central feature of devotion to a single god, although this has been countered by a variety of arguments, e.g. pointing out the similarities between the Hymn to Aten and Psalm 104. Freud's interpretation of the historical Moses is not well accepted among historians, and is considered pseudohistory by many.|$|E
25|$|Many Kurds {{and some}} ethnic Turks {{consider}} Turkish {{military operations in}} Dersim to constitute genocide. A proponent <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> is the academic İsmail Beşikçi. Under international laws, it has been argued, {{the actions of the}} Turkish authorities were not genocide, because they were not aimed at the extermination of a people, but at resettlement and suppression. Scholars, such as Martin van Bruinessen, have instead talked of an ethnocide directed against the local language and identity.|$|E

25|$|From a {{bottom-up}} perspective, happiness {{represents an}} accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches {{are based on the}} idea that there are universal basic human needs and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} company profits are best re-invested in the company: {{research}} and development, capital investment, expansion, etc. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having {{run out of}} good ideas {{for the future of}} the company. Some studies, however, have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting that dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} theories of peace, especially since Woodrow Wilson led the creation of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of international law promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and other functional international organizations. One {{of the most}} important early exponents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>view</b> was Sir Alfred Zimmern, for example in his 1936 book The League of Nations and the Rule of Law.|$|E
