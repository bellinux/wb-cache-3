25|$|Hector Hugh Munro (18 December 1870 – 14 November 1916), {{better known}} by the pen name Saki, and also {{frequently}} as H. H. Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture. He is considered a master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story,</b> and often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, he himself influenced A. A. Milne, Noël Coward and P. G. Wodehouse.|$|E
25|$|The novella is {{generally}} not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story,</b> but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.|$|E

25|$|This {{approach}} {{has been an important}} influence on the short story in Ireland. Recently Jack Hart declared in the preface to his collection From Under Gogol's Nose (2004) that the parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story</b> had been set too narrowly. He advocates a broader range of possibilities, from stories that are almost essays to those that are almost poems. He argues that the short story should be seen as closer by nature to the poem, requiring a similar engagement from the reader and communicating in a similar way through a fundamentally oral/aural process.|$|E

25|$|Producer Ray Stark {{bought the}} film rights to do The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in the mid-1980s, {{and it was}} optioned by Universal Pictures. The first choice to direct it was Frank Oz, with Martin Short {{attached}} for the title role, but Oz could not work {{out how to make}} the story work. The film was optioned in 1991 by Steven Spielberg, with Tom Cruise attached for the lead role, but Spielberg left the project to direct Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. Other directors attached were Patrick Read Johnson and Agnieszka Holland. Stark eventually sold the rights to producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who took the film to Paramount Pictures, with Universal Pictures still on as a co-production partner. By summer 1994, Maryland Film Office chief Jack Gerbes was approached with the possibility of making the film in Baltimore. In October 1998, screenwriter Robin Swicord wrote for director Ron Howard an adapted screenplay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>story,</b> a project which would potentially star actor John Travolta. In May 2000, Paramount Pictures hired screenwriter Jim Taylor to adapt a screenplay from the short story. The studio also attached director Spike Jonze to helm the project. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman had also written a draft of the adapted screenplay at one point. In June 2003, director Gary Ross entered final negotiations to helm the project based on a new draft penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. In May 2004, director David Fincher entered negotiations to replace Ross in directing the film.|$|E
