5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed <b>once</b> <b>more.</b> <b>The</b> National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. <b>Once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>the</b> chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E

5|$|Early on August3, Arlene {{began to}} weaken {{as it turned}} towards the west <b>once</b> <b>more.</b> <b>The</b> storm {{continued}} to slowly weaken before rapidly degenerating into a tropical depression on August4. The quick decrease in intensity {{was the result of}} a sudden increase in vertical wind shear near the core of the cyclone. Later that day, the system passed near the northern Leeward Islands; however, the depression was poorly organized. The former hurricane steadily tracked northwestward and began to regenerate on August7.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post.

5|$|Over the {{following}} five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, making five landfalls, four as a Category 3 hurricane and one as a Category 1. Shortly after entering the Caribbean, the Georges weakened slightly; however, shortly before crossing Puerto Rico, the storm re-attained major hurricane status. After weakening slightly <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>the</b> storm rapidly organized near the Dominican Republic. A well-defined eye formed and outflow re-established, allowing the storm to reach an intensity of 120mph (195km/h) just prior to landfall. During its passage of Hispaniola the circulation was severely disrupted, but Georges maintained hurricane-intensity. On September23, the storm made landfall in southeastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Harold at the Battle of Hastings, Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar, as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York, to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne. This plan {{did not come to}} fruition, however, due to {{opposition}} from the northern earls {{and some of the other}} bishops. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at Wallingford in early December 1066, and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066, although the coronation was performed by Ealdred. William took Stigand with him to Normandy in 1067, although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop, as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges, is uncertain. Stigand was present at the coronation of William's queen, Matilda, in 1068, although <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred.|$|E
