5|$|Lützows forward gun turret {{was hit by}} one of the 15cm rounds, which {{disabled}} {{the center}} gun and damaged the right barrel. Four men were wounded. A second shell struck the ship's deck and penetrated the upper and main armored decks; starting a fire in the cruiser's hospital and <b>operating</b> <b>theater,</b> killing two soldiers and severely wounding six others. A third struck her superstructure behind the port-side aircraft crane. One of the aircraft on board was damaged, and four gunners were killed by the third shell. The ship was only able to fire her secondary battery in return. The heavy damage forced Lützow {{and the rest of the}} squadron to reverse course and exit the fjord. She eventually landed her troop complement in Verle Bay, after which she used her operational 28cm guns to provide fire support. By the afternoon of 9 April, most of the Norwegian fortresses had been captured and the commander of the remaining Norwegian forces opened negotiations for surrender. The delay had, however, allowed enough time for the Norwegian government and royal family to flee Oslo.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{health risk}} {{level in the}} <b>operating</b> <b>theaters</b> is {{directly}} correlated to the safety level offered by the healthcare facilities. This {{is the reason why}} the national Authorities released several regulations in order to monitor better environmental conditions of the <b>operating</b> <b>theaters,</b> to prevent occupational injuries and disease and to optimize working conditions. For the monitoring of environmental quality of the <b>operating</b> <b>theaters</b> following parameters are considered: quantity of supplied gases, anesthetics concentration, operating theatres volume measurement, air change rate, air conditioning system and air filtration. The objective is to minimize the risks in the <b>operating</b> <b>theaters</b> and to provide the optimal environmental working conditions. This paper reports the environmental conditions of operating rooms performed for several years in the public hospitals of the Campania Region. METHODS: Investigation of environmental conditions of 162 <b>operating</b> <b>theaters</b> in Campania Region from January 2012 till July 2014 was conducted. Monitoring and analysis of physical and chemical parameters was done. The analysis of the results has been made considering specific standards suggested by national and international regulations.

On another occasion, she destroyed items in a cloakroom when she was [...] "in a rage", according to the memoirs of Valentina Chebotareva. On October 19, 1915 she was assigned office work at the hospital because {{she was no longer}} able to bear the gore of the <b>operating</b> <b>theater.</b> She was given arsenic injections in October 1915, at the time considered a treatment for depression or nervous disorders. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, one of her mother's ladies in waiting, recalled that Olga had to give up nursing and instead only supervised the hospital wards because she had [...] "overtired herself" [...] and became [...] "nervous and anaemic." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1912 the German surgeon Walther Kausch was {{the first}} to remove large parts of the {{duodenum}} and pancreas together (en bloc). This was in Breslau, now Wrocław in Poland. In 1918 it was demonstrated in operations on dogs that total removal of the duodenum is compatible with life, but this was not reported in human surgery until 1935, when the American surgeon Allen Oldfather Whipple published the results of a series of three operations at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. Only one of the patients had the duodenum totally removed, but he survived for two years before dying of metastasis to the liver. [...] The first operation was unplanned, as cancer was only discovered in the <b>operating</b> <b>theater.</b> [...] Whipple's success showed the way for the future, but the operation remained a difficult and dangerous one until recent decades. [...] He published several refinements to his procedure, including the first total removal of the duodenum in 1940, but he only performed a total of 37 operations.|$|E

2500|$|At a hospital, modern {{surgery is}} often {{performed}} in an <b>operating</b> <b>theater</b> using surgical instruments, an operating {{table for the}} patient, and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures. The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of [...] "sterile" [...] (free of microorganisms) things from [...] "unsterile" [...] or [...] "contaminated" [...] things. [...] All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.|$|E

2500|$|Udekwu {{returned}} to Nigeria in 1965 as paediatric thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon at the University College Hospital of the University of Ibadan. He fled from Ibadan to Biafra at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities that {{marked the beginning of}} the Nigeria-Biafra war. From 1967, he served as a military surgeon and head of the Biafran teaching hospital in various locations including Enugu and Emekukwu during the war. He was also the secretary to the Biafran Relief and Rehabilitation Association during the war. Later Udekwu was distinguished professor and head of department of surgery of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Teaching Hospital (UNTH) and was the administrative head of the Enugu campus of the university. Udekwu is credited with building up the department of surgery of the University of Nigeria. After several unsuccessful attempts at sourcing funding to [...] establish a modern surgical department from many organisations in the United States, United Kingdom, Scandinavia and through church aid, he was able to scrape together funding from the Enugu campus aided by the contributions of individual Nigerians to build the <b>operating</b> <b>theater</b> and buy the equipment needed to establish facilities for open heart surgery in Nigeria. He was one of the pioneers that established cardiac surgery in Nigeria. Professor Udekwu led the team of surgeons that performed the first successful open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974 which was the first of its kind in black Africa. Also in the team of surgeons that performed this landmark operation were Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, Professors Anyanwu C.H., Nwafor D.C., the anaesthetist Dr. Shreeniwas Jawalekar and others. This was followed by a series of six further open heart surgeries under Udekwu at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu (UNTH) between 1974 and 1980.|$|E
