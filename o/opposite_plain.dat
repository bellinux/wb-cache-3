5000|$|Carbohydrates {{have many}} {{roles in the}} body {{including}} functioning as structural units, enzyme cofactors and cell surface recognition sites. Their most prevalent role is in energy storage and delivery in cellular metabolic pathways. The most simple carbohydrates are single sugar residues called monosaccharides like glucose, our body’s energy delivery molecule. Oligosaccharides (up to 10 residues) and polysaccharides (up to about 50,000 residues) consist of saccharide residues bonded in a backbone chain, which is characterized by an ether bond known as a glycosidic linkage. In the body's formation of glycogen, the energy storage polymer, this glycosidic linkage is formed by the enzyme glycogen synthase. The mechanism of this enzymatically driven condensation reaction is not well studied but {{it is known that}} the molecule UDP acts as an intermediary linker and is lost in the synthesis. These backbone chains can be unbranched (containing one linear chain) or branched (containing multiple chains). The glycosidic linkages are designated as Alpha or Beta depending on the relative stereochemistry of the anomeric (or most oxidized) carbon. In a Fischer Projection, if the glycosidic linkage is on the same side or face as carbon 6 of a common biological saccharide, the carbohydrate is designated as Beta and if the linkage is on the opposite side it is designated as Alpha. In a traditional [...] "chair structure" [...] projection, if the linkage is on the same plane (equatorial or axial) as Carbon 6 it is designated as Beta and on the <b>opposite</b> <b>plain</b> it is designated as Alpha. This is exemplified in sucrose (table sugar) which contains a linkage that is alpha to glucose and beta to fructose. Generally, carbohydrates which our bodies break down are alpha-linked (example: glycogen) and those which have structural function are beta-linked (example: cellulose).|$|E

Late in the war, the Hollerith machine section moved to Weimar, so Walter Fricke told the printer to make up a set of three-letter slugs of type corresponding to the code groups, which were called Logotypen. The printer had the plain code values in alphabetical order in a form, with blank spaces for the encrypted values. He was told to draw two logos from the mixed batch and place the second one <b>opposite</b> that <b>plain</b> value which was the same as the first. This procedure was repeated until the reciprocal table was created. It also had the effect of enabled untrained workers to make fewer mistakes.|$|R

25|$|With the American Revolution, {{many of the}} Tory estate owners {{fled the}} country, and were {{replaced}} by the rising elite of the new Boston. In 1777, John Hancock purchased an estate near the pond. The widow Ann Doane bought the estate once owned by Loyalist Joshua Loring (which is still standing, as the Loring-Greenough House). She soon was remarried, to attorney David S. Greenough. When Samuel Adams became governor of Massachusetts, he bought the former Peacock Tavern at today's Centre and Allandale streets, near the Faulkner Hospital. With his wealth made in the China trade, James Perkins built his home, Pinebank, overlooking Jamaica Pond in 1802. In the 1780s, the community built its first church, the Third Parish in Roxbury (now First Congregational Society of Jamaica <b>Plain)</b> <b>opposite</b> the Loring-Greenough house.

40|$|Traditional {{measures}} of species diversity and spatially-explicit {{measures of}} landscape diversity (derived from Romme 1982) {{are used to}} compare biotic diversity in six landscapes across Georgia, USA; two each from the Appalachian Highlands, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain. Species richness and evenness of plots generally increased from the Coastal Plain to the Appalachian Highlands. Community richness, landscape contrast, and landscape heterogeneity increased from the Appalachian Highlands to the Coastal <b>Plain,</b> <b>opposite</b> the gradient of topographic complexity. Coastal Plain landscapes possessed greater contrast and heterogeneity than landscapes {{in the other two}} physiographic provinces. This high level of landscape diversity is interpreted as a response to two factors: the increased role of human activity in shaping landscape structure, and the increased range of soil moisture regimes encountered in the sand-rich substrates of the Coastal Plain (from permanently flooded hydric communities to well drained xeric uplands only a few meters higher in elevation). 1...|$|R

He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! my lady," [...] said Raoul, [...] "the {{thunder of}} heaven could scarce be heard amid the howling of yonder Welsh wolves." [...] Eveline turned as he spoke, and looking towards the bridge, she beheld an appalling spectacle. The river, whose stream washes {{on three sides}} {{the base of the}} proud {{eminence}} on which the castle is situated, curves away from the fortress and its corresponding village on the west, and the hill sinks downward to an extensive plain, so extremely level as to indicate its alluvial origin. Lower down, at the extremity of this plain, where the banks again close on the river, were situated the manufacturing houses of the stout Flemings, which were now burning in a bright flame. The bridge, a high, narrow combination of arches of unequal size, was about half a mile distant from the castle, in the very centre of the plain. The river itself ran in a deep rocky channel, was often unfordable, and at all times difficult of passage, giving considerable advantage to the defenders of the castle, who had spent on other occasions many a dear drop of blood to defend the pass, which Raymond Berenger's fantastic scruples now induced him to abandon. The Welshmen, seizing the opportunity with the avidity with which men grasp an unexpected benefit, were fast crowding over the high and steep arches, while new bands, collecting from different points upon the farther bank, increased the continued stream of warriors, who, passing leisurely and uninterrupted, formed their line of battle on the <b>plain</b> <b>opposite</b> to the castle.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{an outcome of}} a field-mapping project {{encompassing}} the Sabini, Martani and Narnesi-Amerini Mts. Here, Meso-Cenozoic rocks referable to the Umbria-Marche-Sabina succession are unconformably overlain by Neogene- Quaternary marine-to-continental and volcanoclastic deposits. During field-work, our attention {{was focused on the}} analysis of Pelagic Carbonate Platform (PCP) /Basin systems, in particular on the identification of Jurassic submarine paleoescarpments and of facies associations, these being the key tools for understanding the original Jurassic-Early Cretaceous architecture of the local depositional system and its tectono-sedimentary evolution. The Terni area is crucial for appreciating the influence of inherited structures on younger deformation (Neogene- Quaternary). The present-day geological setting of the Terni basin is that of an intermontane basin, bounded by Plio- Pleistocene normal faults and filled with lacustrine-to-continental deposits of the Tiberino basin. Surrounding it, however, the Mesozoic inherited elements and their original (Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous) relationships are well-preserved. As a result of the Early Jurassic rifting stage, a huge shallow-water carbonate platform (Lazio-Abruzzi Platform) characterized the eastern sector of the study area (present-day coordinates), passing west-ward to a slope and basinal setting with intra-basinal highs (respectively, Sabina and Umbria-Marche-Tuscany Basins). Abundant neritic material was resedimented in the deeper-water environments, and the dispersion patterns mirrored the sea-bottom rift topography. The widest PCP recognized in the area is the Sabina Plateau, a N-S trending fault-bounded high passing east- and north-ward to the Sabina Basin via steep paleoescarpments. In particular, the N or NW-dipping escarpment of the Sabina Plateau is exposed near Terni, facing the Terni <b>plain.</b> <b>Opposite</b> to this across the Plain, the circa S-dipping Jurassic paleoescarpment of the Poggio Cisterne Vecchie PCP is well-exposed on the southern slopes of the Martani Mts. These Jurassic paleo-structures imply the existence of a Jurassic basin in the subsurface of the Terni Plain, as marked by: i) unconformable contacts between the horst-block Calcare Massiccio (silicified) and the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous olistolith-bearing hangingwall-block pelagites; ii) neptunian dykes. The existence of an arm of the Sabina Basin branching westwards (the Terni “corridor”) is constrained by the occurrence of shallow-water material embedded in Lower-to-Upper Jurassic basin-fill pelagites exposed in the Amelia Ridge. This post-lower Pliensbachian resedimented material implies a productive carbonate platform (Lazio-Abruzzi Platform) other than the Sabina Plateau, which was already drowned, as the source-area. The Narni Ridge, in contrast, during the Jurassic was effectively shielded by the huge Sabina Plateau from the influx of shallow-material shed by the Lazio-Abruzzi Platform...|$|R
