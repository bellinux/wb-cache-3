You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you." [...] His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as [...] "a big break. <b>One</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour." [...] Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an [...] "excellent" [...] performance while The Observer wrote of [...] "a notable West End debut". In 1992, Sheen's performance in Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him [...] "the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer". His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. and was described by The Independent as [...] "quite thrilling". Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in {{the world premiere of}} Harold Pinter's Moonlight at the Almeida Theatre and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series Gallowglass.|$|E
2500|$|Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian {{has stated}} {{different}} {{origins of the}} band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find {{a name for the}} band, Stephen suggested it; [...] "We were all sitting around {{trying to come up with}} a name. None of us were married or had kids, but <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until we thought of something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better." [...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E

5000|$|The cantata {{is closed}} by an unusual four-part chorale. The Abgesang {{of the bar}} form is repeated, the repeat marked piano.
