5|$|McGill's main {{campus is}} {{situated}} in downtown Montreal {{at the foot of}} Mount Royal. Most of its buildings are situated in a park-like campus located north of Sherbrooke Street and south <b>of</b> <b>Pine</b> Avenue between Peel and Aylmer streets. The campus also extends west of Peel Street for several blocks, starting north of Doctor Penfield; the campus also extends east of University Street, starting north <b>of</b> <b>Pine</b> Avenue, an area that includes McGill's Percival Molson Memorial Stadium and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. The community immediately east of University Street and south <b>of</b> <b>Pine</b> Avenue is known as the McGill Ghetto, where a large number of students reside. The campus is near the Peel and McGill Metro stations. A major downtown boulevard, McGill College Avenue, leads up to the Roddick Gates, the university's formal main entrance. All of the major university buildings were constructed using local grey limestone, which serves as a unifying element.|$|E

40|$|Integration <b>of</b> <b>pines</b> {{into the}} large scope of plant biology {{research}} depends on study <b>of</b> <b>pines</b> in parallel with study of annual plants, and on availability of research materials from pine to plant biologists interested in comparing pine with annual plant systems. The objectives <b>of</b> the <b>Pine</b> Gene Discovery Project were to obtain 10, 000 partial DNA sequences of genes expressed in loblolly pine, to determine which <b>of</b> those <b>pine</b> genes were similar to known genes from other organisms, {{and to make the}} DNA sequences and isolated pine genes available to plant researchers to stimulate integration <b>of</b> <b>pines</b> into the wider scope of plant biology research. Those objectives have been completed, and the results are available to the public.

5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry.

5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow <b>of</b> <b>Pine</b> Creek.

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E

In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident <b>of</b> <b>Pine</b> Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in the leg, which was crippling enough that it required amputation of the leg. His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated for five hours before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} {{at the state}} park, though anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek.

5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones.

The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|Major {{threats to}} the {{cockatoo}} include clearance of their feeding and nesting habitat, destruction of nesting hollows (e.g. during firewood collection), competition with other species for nest sites, and poaching. Since European settlement, 56% of its habitat has been cleared, mainly for agriculture. Furthermore, 54% of its habitat on the Swan Coastal Plain—an important area outside the breeding season—has been lost. Much of this area lies within the Perth metropolitan area, and the city's population is predicted to increase 70% by 2050. The Western Australian State Government has produced a Green Growth Plan to manage this expansion; conservation groups are concerned the cockatoo (along with other species) could suffer further loss of habitat. In particular, the loss <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> plantations north of Perth could jeopardise the species' food supply. In February 2017, WWF-Australia and BirdLife Australia appealed to the Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg to intervene and halt the ongoing removal <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> trees. BirdLife International designated 13 sites (Important Bird Areas) as being important specifically for Carnaby's black cockatoo. These are the Northern Swan Coastal Plain, which supports between 4600 and 15000 birds outside the breeding season, the Stirling Range, and 11 other sites that support between 20 and 110 breeding pairs of Carnaby's black cockatoos.|$|E
