5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> <b>and</b> that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E

5|$|Sir Thursday is a {{young adult}} fantasy novel written by Australian author Garth Nix. It is the fourth book in The Keys to the Kingdom series, and was {{released}} in March 2006. Sir Thursday continues from the preceding book, following the adventures of Arthur Penhaligon as he attempts to retrieve the Fourth key of the Kingdom, and claim mastership of The Great Maze. As with the other books in the series, the theme of 'seven' is prevalent, along with the themes <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> virtue. The book received generally favourable critical response, but was criticised for a slow pace, among other issues.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption for a life <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At {{the start of the}} film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

25|$|Early Mormon soteriology, {{although}} not following a preexisting tradition, was generally Arminian in tendency.

25|$|Total depravity (also called {{absolute}} inability {{and total}} corruption) is a theological doctrine that {{derives from the}} Augustinian concept of original sin. It is the teaching that, {{as a consequence of}} the fall of man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and,</b> apart from the efficacious or prevenient grace of God, is utterly unable to choose to follow God or choose to accept salvation as it is freely offered.|$|E
25|$|Something Wicked This Way Comes can be {{interpreted}} as an allegory of the struggle between good and evil, with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality, and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> temptation. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good that is always on the verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of us that resists giving in.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Gordon Wenham of Trinity College, Bristol, {{noted that}} the {{sacrificial}} system regularly associates sacrifices with cleansing and sanctification. Wenham read Leviticus to teach that sacrificial blood was necessary to cleanse and sanctify. Sacrifice could undo the effects <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> human infirmity. Sin and disease profaned the holy and polluted the clean, whereas sacrifice could reverse this process. Wenham illustrated with the chart at right. Wenham concluded that contact between the holy and the unclean resulted in death. Sacrifice, by cleansing the unclean, made such contact possible. Sacrifice thus allowed the holy God to meet with sinful man.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century some Congregational (later Congregational Christian) churches took {{exception}} to {{the beginnings of a}} growth of regional or national authority in bodies outside the local church, such as mission societies, national committees, and state conferences. Some congregations opposed liberalizing influences that appeared to mitigate traditional views <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> corollary doctrines such as the substitutionary atonement of Jesus. In 1948, some adherents of these two streams of thought (mainly the latter one) started a new fellowship, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (CCCC). It was the first major fellowship to organize outside of the mainstream Congregational body since 1825 when the Unitarians formally founded their own body.|$|E
25|$|Baptism {{also became}} a public event in Geneva, with the font moved {{to the front of}} the church or even being {{attached}} to the pulpit. Confirmation was abolished, but as in Strasbourg children were expected to make a public profession of faith when able, and this became the standard rite of passage for children to be admitted to communion in Reformed churches. Puritans also saw baptism as a prophetic sign at the beginning of Christian life. Confession <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> professions of faith (such as reciting the Apostles' Creed) were considered the fulfillment of the sign, the living out of one's baptism, or improving on one's baptism.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that the prayer is {{secondary}} argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> <b>and</b> (2) {{the beginning and end of}} the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by the same author(s).|$|E

25|$|Shaushtatar, king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian {{capital of}} Assur {{some time in}} the 15th century during the reign of Nur-ili, and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to Washshukanni. This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of Eriba-Adad I (13901366 BC). There is no trace of that in the Assyrian king lists; {{therefore}} it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple <b>of</b> <b>Sin</b> <b>and</b> Shamash was built in Ashur.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>Sin</b> <b>and</b> Punishment lasted {{longer than}} usual for the era. Development commenced in 1997 with only four staff and concluded in 2000 with more people involved than in any of Treasure's previous projects. The guiding inspiration to develop Sin and Punishment was {{the design of the}} Nintendo 64 controller. Treasure wanted to make a game that had the player holding {{the left side of the}} controller instead of the right which was typical across the system's library. The Treasure team encountered difficulties programming the game, citing the system's complex 3D rendering capabilities and difficulties adapting 2D gameplay ideas into 3D environments. Originally titled Glass Soldier by Treasure, the game was retitled to Sin and Punishment by Nintendo, wanting a name that stood out.|$|E

Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, Ethica or Scito te ipsum (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> <b>and</b> that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions. During this period, he also wrote Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos, a commentary on St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, where he expands {{on the meaning of}} Christ's life.|$|E
