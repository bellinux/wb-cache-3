5|$|Automobile air {{conditioning}} systems were commonly fitted with fusible plugs, <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 100–110°C, but from concerns about the environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in all-electric mode at low speeds, the Volt is {{fitted with a}} manually activated electronic warning sound system called Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System for use when the car is <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car's presence.|$|E

5000|$|Startup time - PEMFC {{fuel cell}} mCHP <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> low {{temperature}} (50 to 100 °C) and needs high purity hydrogen, it {{is prone to}} contamination, changes are made to <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer. SOFC fuel cell mCHP <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> a high temperature (500 to 1,000 °CP) and can handle different energy sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature, changes are made to <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> a lower temperature. Because of the higher temperature, SOFC in general has a longer start-up time.|$|R
5|$|Widerøe is {{the main}} airline <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> Banak, with daily flights to Alta and Tromsø using Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. During the Weekdays, Norwegian Air Shuttle {{operates}} a twice-weekly service to Oslo using their Boeing 737 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although {{licensed}} to Oakland, {{a community in}} Western Bergen County, radio station WVNJ <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 1160kHz on the AM dial maintains its studios at 1086 Teaneck Road.

5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

The HSI (high speed input) / HSO (high speed output) family <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> 16 and 20 MHz, and the EPA (event processor array) family <b>operates</b> <b>at</b> all of the frequencies.|$|R
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Comilla Model {{simultaneously}} {{addressed the}} problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes. The initiatives included the establishment of: a training and development centre; a road-drainage embankment works programme; a decentralized, small scale irrigation programme; and, a two-tiered cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages, and federations <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> sub-district level.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> low speeds.|$|E

5|$|Fast Ferries service began {{initially}} with {{a single}} boat, the 118-passenger Rich Passage 1, in 2017. The vessel is a catamaran designed to create a very low wake while <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> high speeds by employing a special foil. A second boat of a similar design is planned {{be added to the}} Bremerton route in 2019. The agency's plans call for the purchase of a 150-passenger catamaran for delivery in 2018, two 250-passenger bow loading catamarans for delivery in 2020 and 2021, and an additional 118-passenger high-speed, low-wake catamaran to be delivered in 2022.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> a {{position}} where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only <b>operating</b> <b>at</b> 60% capacity, and Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
