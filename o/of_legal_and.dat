5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E

5|$|Described in the chronicles as a rash and temperamental man, Carrouges {{was also}} a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty-year {{military}} career in which he served in Normandy, Scotland and Hungary with distinction and success. He was also heavily involved in court politics, initially at {{the seat of his}} overlord Count Pierre of Alen√ßon at Argentan, but later in the politics of the Royal household at Paris, to which he was attached as a chevalier d'honneur and Royal bodyguard in the years following the judicial duel. During his life he conducted a long trail <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may have invited violence against himself and his family. The truth of the events which led him into public mortal combat in the Paris suburbs may never be known, but the legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2145. Much of the game's story and {{dialogue}} was created by author Matthew J. Costello. According to the game's backstory, the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) has grown to become the largest corporate entity in existence, and has set up a research facility on Mars. At this base, the UAC are able to conduct research into several scientific areas, including advanced weapons development, biological research, space exploration and teleportation. On Mars, the UAC can perform its operations outside <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> moral boundaries. As the player progresses through the game, they learn that the employees on the base are unsettled due to a large number of incidents involving hearing voices, unexplained sightings and increasing cases of paranoia and insanity, often leading to fatal accidents with the facility's machinery. Rumors regarding the nature of experiments in the UAC's Delta Labs division are especially prevalent among the base's employees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Identifying <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> illegal states {{significantly}} reduces computational {{complexity of}} ATPG. A unified framework for identification <b>of</b> the <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> illegal states is presented. Most known methods for identification <b>of</b> the <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> illegal states are interpretable within this framework. New theorems {{and the resulting}} procedures for identifying exact collection <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> or illegal states of a circuit are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that exact collection <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> states for some circuits is significantly smaller than collections obtained by backward state search algorithm and by algorithm based on combinational ATPG theorems. The use of the exact collection <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> states allows identifying more undetectable faults. The proposed procedure for identifying of the exact collection <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> states starts from any state of the circuit, builds initially an enlarged collection <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> states <b>and</b> converges rapidly to the exact solution. Key words: sequential circuits, <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> illegal states, detectability of faults. 1...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), {{it was the first}} in a series of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel The God Thing that he had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> structural reasons.|$|E
