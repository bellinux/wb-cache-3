40|$|Internet Tra c, Internet Applications, Internet Attacks, Tra c Pro ling, Multi-Scale Analysis {{abstract}} Nowadays, the Internet {{can be seen}} as an ever-changing platform {{where new}} and di erent types of services and applications are constantly emerging. In fact, many of the existing dominant applications, such as social networks, have appeared recently, being rapidly adopted by the user community. All these new applications required the implementation of novel communication protocols that present di erent network requirements, according to the service they deploy. All this diversity and novelty has lead to an increasing need of accurately pro ling Internet users, by mapping their tra c to the <b>originating</b> <b>application,</b> in order to improve many network management tasks such as resources optimization, network performance, service personalization and security. However, accurately mapping tra c to its <b>originating</b> <b>application</b> is a di cult task due to the inherent complexity of existing network protocols and to several restrictions that prevent the analysis of the contents of the generated tra c. In fact, many technologies, such as tra c encryption, are widely deployed to assure and protect the con dentiality and integrity of communications over the Internet. On the other hand, many legal constraints also forbid the analysis of the clients' tra c in order to protect their con dentiality and privacy. Consequently, novel tra c discrimination methodologies are necessary for an accurate tra c classi cation and user pro ling. This thesis proposes several identi cation methodologies for an accurate Internet tra c pro ling while coping with the di erent mentioned restrictions and with the existing encryption techniques. By analyzing the several frequency components present in the captured tra c and inferring the presence of the di erent network and user related events, the proposed approaches are able to create a pro le for each one of the analyzed Internet applications. The use of several probabilistic models will allow the accurate association of the analyzed tra c to the corresponding application. Several enhancements will also be proposed in order to allow the identi cation of hidden illicit patterns and the real-time classi cation of captured tra c. In addition, a new network management paradigm for wired and wireless networks will be proposed. The analysis of the layer 2 tra c metrics and the di erent frequency components that are present in the captured tra c allows an e cient user pro ling in terms of the used web-application. Finally, some usage scenarios for these methodologies will be presented and discussed. Tese de doutoramento em Metodologias para caracterização de tráfego em redes de comunicaçõe...|$|E

40|$|Cyclic {{timetabling}} {{for public}} transportation companies is usually modeled by the periodic event scheduling problem. To deduce a mixed-integer programming formulation, artificial integer variables {{have to be}} introduced. There {{are many ways to}} define these integer variables. We show that the minimal number of integer variables required to encode an instance is achieved by introducing an integer variable for each element of some integral cycle basis. An integral cycle basis consists of |A | − |V | + 1 oriented cycles of a directed graph D = (V, A) that enable any oriented cycle of the directed graph to be expressed as an integer linear combination. The solution times for the <b>originating</b> <b>application</b> vary extremely with different integral cycle bases. However, our computational studies show that the width of integral cycle bases is a good empirical measure for the solution time of the MIP. Clearly, integral cycle bases permit a much wider choice than the former standard approach, in which integer variables are associated with the co-tree arcs of some spanning tree. Hence, to formulate better solvable integer programs, we present algorithms that construct integral cycle bases of small width. To that end, we investigate classes of directed cycle bases that are closely related to integral cycle bases, namely (generalized) fundamental and undirected cycle bases. This gives rise to both, a compact classification of directed cycle bases and notable reductions of running times for cyclic timetabling...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} cross applications in civil protection order proceedings in New South Wales (NSW) (known as Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders, ADVOs). A cross application takes place when one person in an existing or former intimate relationship, usually the woman, applies for an ADVO and sometime afterwards the defendant in that <b>originating</b> <b>application,</b> usually the man, seeks an ADVO against the first person. The focus on cross applications provides a means to investigate the nature of men’s and women’s competing allegations about domestic violence, and to explore {{the way in which}} professionals working within the ADVO system approach, and seek to unravel, these competing claims. This thesis draws on the extensive debate within the sociological literature about ‘what is domestic violence’ and whether domestic violence is gendered in its perpetration. This debate has been paid scant attention in the legal literature. This thesis {{examines the}} assumptions underpinning the legal definitions and understandings of domestic violence in the civil protection order system, with reference to these theoretical debates about ‘what is domestic violence’ and ‘what counts as domestic violence’. To do so it draws on empirical work: semi-structured in-depth interviews with women involved in cross applications and key professionals working in the field, documentary analysis of court files, and observations of court proceedings. The key contribution of this thesis to this literature is threefold: (1) it explores the question of gender perpetration through the investigation of official data (a data source little explored in debates about gender and domestic violence), (2) it combines qualitative and quantitative methods in a single study, and (3) it extends questions about the gendered perpetration of domestic violence to the legal arena (in particular the prime legal arena that responds to domestic violence in NSW, the ADVO system, a system ostensibly designed to better respond to domestic violence). This thesis found that, like other studies in this field, the analysis of quantitative data alone reveals few differences between the types of violence men and women are alleged to use against their intimate partners. However when supplemented by qualitative data differences started to emerge particularly for men who lodged their application second in time. This qualitative analysis reveals not only that male second applicants appeared to make claims of a different nature, but that some men appeared to use the ADVO process to undermine women’s claims for legal protection. The differences that emerged between men and women’s alleged experiences of domestic violence resonated with feminist understandings of domestic violence that highlight its function of control and the repetitive, cumulative environment in which violence is perpetrated by men against women. While the study focussed on cross applications, its findings reveal a number of issues of concern for the ADVO system more broadly: its focus on incidents, the poor quality of complaint narratives, the brevity of court proceedings and the emphasis on settlement. These features undermine the progressive potential of the ADVO legislation to capture more than single incidents of largely physical violence. This was further {{compounded by the fact that}} while the professionals interviewed articulated broad definitions of domestic violence, this tended to be lost when responding to practice-orientated questions (here professionals returned to incident-based definitions). Perhaps more significantly the defining feature of domestic violence as a mechanism of control is not articulated in the NSW legislation, and hence (not unsurprisingly) was generally not articulated in the complaint narratives examined in this thesis. Yet control was the dominant way in which the women interviewed described their relationship with their former partner. The failure of complaint narratives to reflect the dimension of control, combined with the failure of key professionals to give sufficient emphasis to control in their practice under the ADVO legislation, an absence highlighted through the focus on cross applications, is an issue of concern for the ADVO system generally. This is important given the growing recognition in the research literature of the fundamental nature of control to the experience of domestic violence, particularly women’s experiences of domestic violence...|$|E
