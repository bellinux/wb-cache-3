5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

He treated his fellow Justices, clerks and attorneys representing parties with respect and consideration. While Justice Harlan often strongly objected to certain conclusions and arguments, he never criticized other justices <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> personally, and never said any disparaging words about someone's motivations and capacity.

[...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E

[...] The inclusion of the song caused controversy, with law-enforcement and victims-rights groups expressing outrage.|$|E

[...] While she is performing, Mao {{begins to}} sing an Italian love song even if it is against the rules to use vocal music during competitions. The Judges would probably disqualify her from the competition, but despite this Hikari and Mao finished their performance which is applauded from the crowd and their friends, Ooishi and Shiina, who have come to see them perform. Before the announcements from the judges <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> can be made, both Hikari and Mao exit the competition arena and are quickly seen exiting the building. While they are leaving Ooishi and Shiina run towards them, calling out to them with smiles on their faces. As they continue to towards the exit both Mao and Hikari look behind them. The manga concludes with Hikari smiling, hinting that in the end she may have not won a medal, but that she will have a bright future with Mao.|$|E

2500|$|Early episodes {{featured}} Dave Lee, {{who provided}} piano accompaniment on I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He {{is often the}} butt of jokes about his musical ability to which {{he is unable to}} respond as he has no microphone. [...] For example: [...] "When music experts hear Colin's compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> employed by the German State Railway." [...] Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have [...] "won the coin toss" [...] as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this [...] "has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell."

2500|$|... 1987 saw Korolyov even better-poised to go {{into the}} {{succeeding}} year’s Olympics than at the same point in time in the previous quadrennium. [...] Despite the very successful return of Bilozerchev and the rise of younger Soviet stars such as Valeri Liukin and Valentin Mogilny, Korolyov still managed to win his 3rd European All-Around Silver Medal, behind Liukin, at that year's competition in Moscow, adding to that 1 gold and 1 silver in event finals. [...] Even more impressive was his performance at the 1987 World Gymnastics Championships in Rotterdam. [...] Although Korolyov only qualified 4th among his Soviet teammates, compatriate Liukin had to withdraw from the Individual All-Around because of an unfortunate knee injury, freeing Korolyov to compete in the All-Around final where he placed 2nd behind Bilozerchev and, buttressed by a perfect score of 10.00 on vault, even logged a higher 6-event composite score in the all-around final than Bilozerchev (<b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else).</b> [...] (Under the New Life rules instituted two years later, he would have been World All-Around Champion.) ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{became a}} ballroom-sized {{room with a}} double-height ceiling full of Renaissance-type frescoes, with Baccarat crystal chandeliers. The carved marble {{fireplace}} was taken from an old Louisiana plantation home. Hill chose parquet flooring and a gold and white color scheme for the entire room. The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels. [...] The room became a bone of contention; Joan was angry about the amount of money her husband had poured into realizing his dream. During their 1968 separation, she had confided in Patti Gordon, a friend who owned a restaurant, that the music room had been central to their troubles.

In short, McHoul might ask where the idea of Language stops and the design of a lecture theatre, say, begins; indeed, he might ask the question: what part does either play in everyday life and, importantly, specific cultures? ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E
2500|$|Football pundits Johnny Giles, Eamon Dunphy and Graeme Souness, {{analysing}} {{the video}} replays on RTÉ Two, disputed whether Shay Given <b>or</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> was obscuring {{the view of}} the assistant referee from seeing the incident, although they were not certain the assistant could have flagged with certainty for handball even if he had a clear line of sight, due to the speed of the incident and flight of the ball. Former Irish international and football pundit Mark Lawrenson said [...] "The man cheated. He controlled the ball with the second handball. It is a Maradona moment". Another former Irish international Tony Cascarino wrote in The Times that Henry [...] "speaks so eloquently, but to me now he'll always be insincere, a faker, someone who cares only about himself". Former French international David Ginola said [...] "I'm very embarrassed by the situation...I don’t feel very proud to be French this morning. The Irish played very well and they deserved to go through as much as France, maybe more. I'm very surprised FIFA haven't mentioned anything about it – the whole world saw the handball. This is a pure injustice. Everyone in France, the press and everyone, says there should be a replay". Former Ireland captain Roy Keane said the attempt by the FAI to get a replay was [...] "rubbish", telling them to [...] "get over it", that France were there for the taking and Ireland should not have allowed Henry to be in such a good position in the first place. Keane later apologised to any Irish fans offended by his [...] "over the top" [...] comments.|$|E
