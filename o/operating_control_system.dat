The model modulation techniques applied to adaptive <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are briefly discussed.

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of high-speed railways, {{a call for}} fulfilling the notion of communication at "anytime, anywhere" for high-speed train passengers in the Train <b>Operating</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> is on the way. In {{order to make a}} realization of that, new railway wireless communication networks are needed. The most promising one is the Long Term Evolution for Railway which will provide broadband access, fast handover, and reliable communication for high mobility users. However, with the increase of speed, the system is subjected to high bit error rate, Doppler frequency shift and handover failure just like other system does. This paper is trying to solve these problems by employing MIMO technique. Specifically, the goal is to provide higher data rate, higher reliability, less delay, and other relative quality of services for passengers. MIMO performance analysis, resource allocation, and access control for handover and various services in a two-hop model are proposed in this paper. Analytical results and simulation results show that the proposed model and schemes perform well in improving the system performances.

Group IV semiconductor (Si, Ge and Sn) nanocrystals were synthesized in dielectric matrixes by ion implantation of the respective species into the matrix to form a supersaturated solid solution and subsequent precipitation by thermal annealing. The resulting structure was characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that nanocrystals of these materials can be effectively synthesized with diameters in the nanometer range. Ge nanocrystals in SiO[ [...] . ] were extensively characterized, particle size distributions were counted from TEM results and were used to compare experimental photoluminescence spectra with theoretical predictions. Unusual nanostructures were formed in samples co-implanted with Ge and Sn and annealed at 600 °C. Raman spectroscopy indicated a possibility of significant alloying of Ge and Sn in these nanostructures. Optical properties of Si nanocrystals in silicon dioxide were investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy as well. It was found that while Ge nanocrystal system luminescence is mostly due to defects in the matrix produced by ion implantation, Si nanocrystal sample luminescence is due to the Si nanocrystals themselves. The luminescence is above the bulk Si bandgap and supports the quantum confined excitonic luminescence theory. Light emitting devices were fabricated using both systems. Electroluminescence was observed for both Si and Ge, albeit with rather low efficiency, in the 10 [ [...] . ] - 10 [ [...] . ] range. Electroluminescence from Si nanocrystal containing devices was spectrally similar to photoluminescence from that system, with a band about 800 nm, consistent with electronic excitation of radiative transitions in Si nanocrystals. Cubic nonlinearities were measured for both Ge and Si nanocrystals and found to be 10 [ [...] . ] - 10 [ [...] . ] esu range. Finally, an interesting interferometric arrangement which has a potential to be useful for investigating nanoscale structures was theoretically described. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a proposed test plan for harvesting energy from waves with a linear machine that uses gas-springs. The linear machine &# 147;Prototype 2 B&# 148; {{has been put}} into production and will be finished. The machine has been constructed to withstand 300 bars of gas pressure and the maximum speed of the rotor is set to 10 m/s due to the sealing. The model made in [5] uses the fundamental equations and describes the system behavior of a linear machine with gas springs. The model has been slightly improved and the input specifications for the &# 147;Prototype 2 B&# 148; have been used. The simulations shows that one needs to feed electric energy {{in some parts of}} the cycle, but the whole cycle will yield a positive net contribution of electrical energy. The model is not optimized, and hence should be improved due to the time consuming simulations. Steel profiles have been proposed to use for the frame of the test-bench. The first draft of the drawing has been sent to NTNU and the workers have started to build the frame. To ensure the vibration energy to spread itself into the surroundings, isolators need to be selected and adapted. The natural frequency of the test bench with four chosen isolators was calculated to 18, 17 Hz. The chosen isolators are therefore most likely good enough since the lowest operating frequency of the machine was simulated to 55 Hz. Transferring the energy from the high-force-low-speed source (the wave) to the resonator has been discussed and some suggestions have been proposed. The energy transfer is done by raising pressure in a freestanding actuator with a hose connected to the gas spring. Hence, increasing the actuator pressure will increase the gas spring pressure and the force acting on the rotor will be significantly higher. A procedure to select the correct components are discussed and a Matlab script for analyzing the choice has been made. The high-force-low-speed source has been discussed. Two solutions where a hydraulic system is used have been further investigated, and some calculations and analysis have been performed. Simulations show that one need to apply a maximum force of 24115 N at one actuator with a 32 mm effective piston area. The regulation of the high-force-low-speed source could be crucial to obtain a good test result since the regulation of the wave must adapt itself to the resonating force of the rotor. The regulation must therefore be investigated further as it can have tremendous impact on the possibility of extracting energy from the machine. The electrical source and regulation control have been discussed. Timing of the electrical energy supplied is crucial and three operational simulations have been performed to investigate when the positive net contribution is at it`s highest. In order to extract the maximum possible net energy from the machine, the right electrical control is very important to implement. Two of the control systems have been proposed, where perhaps the simple proportional controller should be chosen to prove the concept. Later on a more sophisticated electrical controller should be applied since the efficiency of the wave energy converter could increase significantly. The non-linear compression event in the gas-springs is not proportional to the electrical extracted energy. Simulations show that when the pressure increases in the springs one could extract more energy, but the non-linear event could not be recognized. Simulations show that the efficiency of the system varies significantly with the controlling of the machine. If a simple proportional controller is adapted, the theoretical efficiency becomes 2, 87 % and with a more sophisticated controller one could get 10, 02 %. This means that there must be done more research on the electrical <b>operating</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> if energy harvesting could be profitable. </p...|$|E

To understand and implement an inclusive design approach to {{the development of an}} electronically <b>operated</b> water <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to ensure that the product is usable by people regardless of age or ability. 3. To understand to what effect design decisions, related to the usability of a product, have upon the desirability of the product to all users. The product development process used in the development of this product was successful. It resulted in an innovative new product idea that has associated intellectual property, currently under patent application. The product was identified as both usable to people {{with a wide range of}} impairments and desirable to a majority of all potential users. The research methodology relating to inclusive design resulted in the finding that some design decisions relating to the usability of products do in fact affect the desirability of the product to other potential users, and hence could potentially affect the financial success of the product. A set of activities were identified from the process used in this case study and recommended for further product development projects, which will help to ensure that the product is made more usable while still retaining its desirability.
