At synthesis of control law theory of automatic control, power network engineering and circuit technique are considered. The control law for distributive control over the direct-axis and quadrature-axis currents of invertor after abc-dq transform of three phase current’s momentary value is used. Results. The improved model of regulator of direct-axis invertor’s current is developed and provides the voltage optimization of invertor’s operating both from solar module and from network by means of calculation the reactive power consumption from network, voltage on network and voltage on solar module. The improved model of regulator of quadrature-axis invertor’s current is developed and provides the power and frequency optimization of invertor’s operating by means of calculation ratio of active power consumption and power from solar module. Originality. The offered control law and device, which realize it, is working out on secondary loop from power network smart grid with active and reactive power consumption monitoring. That provides the optimal operation of solar station both from solar module and from power network. Practical value.

40|$|Based on <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> management, {{this paper}} {{introduces}} a new framework for studying dynamics of Discrete Event Systems (DES). Studied system presents several <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> {{due to the}} state space explosion problem. To cure this problem, we propose a multi-model approach where each model describes a system in a given <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> We assume that only one attempted <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> is activated at a time, whilst other modes must be inactivated. In order to ensure the alternation between these <b>operating</b> <b>modes,</b> we propose a formal approach using linear algebra. The commutation problem {{can be defined as}} compatibility problem when the behavior of physical system switches from an <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> to another.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> {{management}} of discrete event systems (DES) and this contribution {{is based on}} supervisory control theory (SCT). Our aim is to extend SCT by introducing a mechanism for managing different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> for the controlled system. An <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> corresponds to a specific system structure (engagement or disengagement of different system components) and specified tasks. Mode management will consist in controlling switching between modes {{with a view to}} handling models of reasonable size. Our approach is a multi-model one and involves representing a complex system by a set of simple automata models, each of which describes the system in a given <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> The adopted approach assumes that only one attempted <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> is activated at a time, whilst other modes must be deactivated. The switching problem may be defined as finding compatible states, when controlled system behavior switches from one <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> to another. The major contribution of this paper is the avoidance of switching from states (called forbidden states) with ghost compatible states in the selected <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> These states are called ghost because their existence would potentially violate a defined selected mode specificatio...|$|R

A two-loop robust MPC with multiple overlapping <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> is developed {{to deal with the}} control of systems associated with high nonlinearities.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for designing suitable switching control decisions for discrete event systems (DES) whose structures change as they develop in different <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> Control decisions consist of either an event in a sequence to occur enabling an event or preventing the event from taking place disabling an event. Our contribution enables to adopt different modeling approaches and ensures switching between all designed process models when there is commutation between the <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> Thus, {{in the context of}} supervisory control theory (SCT), we propose that each model automaton represents process functionning in a specific <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> Specifications imposed on any <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> could be conflicting. An attractive alternative is switching control, in which a different controller is applied to each <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> [P. Charbonnaud, F. Rotella, S. Medar. Process <b>Operating</b> <b>mode</b> Monitoring Process: Switching Online the Right Controller, IEEE transactions on systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part C 3 1 (1) pp 77 - 86. 2002; M. Zefran, J. Burdick, Design of switching controllers for systems with changing dynamics, in: Proceedings of the 37 th conference on Decision and control, 1998, pp. 2113 - 2118]. Control of process functionning means that both process and specification models must be associated with one specific <b>operating</b> <b>mode.</b> Based on supervisory control theory, our work focuses on <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> management in particular when the process is subject to failure. The adopted approach (multi-model) assumes that only one attempted <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> is activated at any one time, while the others are considered desactivated. The problem of commutation and tracking between all designed models (process and specification) is formalised by the proposed framework. In this context, several questions are raised. Is the process engaged in a state which is compatible with the atteined mode ? Are the specifications consistant with each starting state ?. Are the specification conflicting ? Can all defined states be reachable ? To answer correctly these questions, a mode switching mechanism must be formalised...|$|R

40|$|Many {{embedded}} {{control systems}} work in different <b>operating</b> <b>modes,</b> for example start-up, stand-by, shut-down and failure <b>mode.</b> These different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> usually have different timing requirements, {{and the different}} functional behaviour also leads to differences in timing behaviour. A Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis of such a system needs to determine mode-specific bounds on execution times, because a single overall bound may be too pessimistic. Mode determination and mode-specific analysis also form a prerequisite for analysing system behaviour during mode transitions, a most critical phase of a system. The <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> of embedded control systems are often not precisely represented, neither in hand-written code nor in code synthesised by model-based design tools nor on the model level.
