5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lab, but no difference <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|As may be <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> table below, {{the main}} {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more precisely.|$|E
5|$|If k2 {{is greater}} than one, F2−F1 is a {{negative}} number; thus, the added inverse-cube force is attractive, as <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green planet of Figures1–4 and 9. By contrast, if k2 is less than one, F2−F1 is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is repulsive, as <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green planet of Figures5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures4 and 5.|$|E

5|$|Like other jays, {{this species}} is likely {{extremely}} intelligent. Similar species {{are known to}} use ants to keep their feathers clean, store seeds and nuts for later consumption, and use their toes to hold food.

5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
