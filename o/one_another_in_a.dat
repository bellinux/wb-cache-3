5|$|Both leagues play a 143-game regular season, {{after which}} the top three teams in each league compete against <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{two-stage}} playoff. In the First Stage, the teams that finish the regular season with the second- and third-best records play <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> best-of-three series. The winners of these three-game series advance to the Final Stage to face each league's regular-season champion in a six-game series, which the regular-season champion starts with a one-game advantage.

5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin {{by a margin of}} 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E

Opposing it was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army. Over the next two weeks, American and North Korean forces fought a bloody series of engagements inflicting heavy casualties on <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> confusing series of attacks and counterattacks, but neither side was able to gain the upper hand. In the end, the US forces, aided by reinforcements, air support and heavy weapons, destroyed the invading North Korean force which was hampered by lack of supply and high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|The armies {{stared at}} <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, {{the same day}} that the Vicksburg {{garrison}} surrendered to Maj. Gen.

The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated {{to be as much}} as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E

25|$|William Smith (1769–1839), an English canal engineer, {{observed}} that rocks {{of different ages}} (based {{on the law of}} superposition) preserved different assemblages of fossils, and that these assemblages succeeded <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular and determinable order.
