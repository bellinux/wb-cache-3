5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E

5|$|On October 27, Sanchez {{started for}} the final time {{in place of the}} injured Booty, an away game against Oregon at Autzen Stadium. USC lost, 24–17; Sanchez had two passes intercepted by Oregon safety Matthew Harper in the second half. The first {{interception}} led to a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave Oregon a 14-point lead; the second interception ended USC's final chance for a comeback. In spite of a myriad <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> committed by his teammates in addition to his own, Sanchez publicly accepted blame for the loss. The following week, against Oregon State, Booty returned as USC's starting quarterback, with Sanchez resuming his position as Booty's backup. Sanchez did not perform in subsequent games and finished the season with 695 yards and seven touchdowns with five interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote {{a review of the}} Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E
5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal <b>of</b> <b>mistakes</b> and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E

40|$|In essence, Williams 2 ̆ 7 {{specific}} proposal is that death be authorized {{for a person}} in the above situation 2 ̆ 2 by giving the medical practitioner a wide discretion and trusting to his good sense. 2 ̆ 2 This, I submit, raises too great a risk <b>of</b> abuse and <b>mistake</b> to warrant a change in the existing law.

I submit, too, that the possible radiations from the proposed legislation, e. g., involuntary euthanasia of idiots and imbeciles (the typical 2 ̆ 2 mercy killings 2 ̆ 2 reported by the press) and the emergence of the legal precedent that there are lives not 2 ̆ 2 worth living, 2 ̆ 2 give additional cause to pause...|$|R

40|$|Mistaking {{patients}} {{is one of}} the undesirable errors in health care. When disclosed, it makes the entire medical facility look bad and degrades its prestige. An individual?s error also affects {{the other members of the}} medical staff. This topic is very current, which {{is one of the}} reasons why I chose it for my bachelor?s thesis paper. Safe identification of {{patients is}} one of the principal requirements in the provision of high-quality care to patients. Failure of this requirement may lead to mistaking patients, organs, confusing which side to operate on or the surgery itself. The objective of this bachelor?s thesis paper is to identify the risk factors in the individual areas of nursing care as part of the prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients and to determine what methods are most frequently used in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients at selected hospital wards. Two hypotheses were identified. H 1 : The strongest risk factor increasing the probability <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients is insufficient staff-patient communication; and H 2 : The most frequently used method <b>of</b> prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients is the use of identification wrist bands. The research survey was executed in the form of inquiry, using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was intended for nurses. The task of the respondents was to evaluate the risk <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients when a particular risk factor is in action. The risk factors were classified into five groups: communication, documentation administration, administering drugs, surgical procedures and patient identification. In the following part of the survey I determined the methods <b>of</b> prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients that the respondents most often use in their work. The assessment of the individual statements concerning the issue in question did not confirm Hypothesis 1. The questioned nurses think that communication among staff is the strongest risk factor (mean: 3. 96). The strongest risk factor ? failure to provide information about patients ? was found in the field of communication between the nurse and the physician and between the nurses. Hypothesis 2 was confirmed. According to the answers supplied by the nurses, identification wrist bands are the most frequently used method in the field of the prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients (mean: 4. 83). The second most frequently used method of the prevention <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients is the use of active verbal identification (mean: 4. 59). The results of the survey were submitted to the Regional Hospital in Pardubice in the form of a summary chart. The chart contains the strongest risk factors <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients and preventive mechanisms leading to their reduction. The survey aims to contribute to the elimination of risk factors <b>of</b> <b>mistaking</b> patients and thus increase the safety of patients when hospitalised...|$|R
