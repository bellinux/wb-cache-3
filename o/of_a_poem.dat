5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem.</b> Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|Sayers wrote {{numerous}} essays, {{poems and}} stories {{which appeared in}} several publications, including Time and Tide, The Times Literary Supplement, Atlantic Monthly, Punch, The Spectator and the Westminster Gazette; {{in the last of}} these she was the author <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> under the pseudonym H.P. Rallentando. She also wrote several book reviews for The Sunday Times.|$|E
5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{established}} Tintern Abbey as a Cistercian monastery on 9 May 1131, {{the second}} Cistercian monastic {{house to be}} endowed in Britain. The monks for the establishment came from L'Aumône Abbey in France. Although the ruins of Tintern were the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> by William Wordsworth and a painting by J. M. W. Turner, these ruins are not Walter's original buildings, as little remains of them.|$|E
5|$|In {{many forms}} of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other {{structural}} elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, {{in the case of}} the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem.</b> For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.|$|E

5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{began work}} on The Cantos in earnest after {{relocating}} to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in Poetry in June–August 1917. The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in The Transatlantic Review in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Poem</b> of some Length now first made into a Book.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E

5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E
