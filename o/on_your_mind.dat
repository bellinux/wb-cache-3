5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mind,</b> {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, Martin said: [...] "That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> whether it's the downfall of global economics or terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets you most is when you fancy someone." [...] The liner notes from A Rush of Blood to the Head, on the other hand, states that [...] "The Scientist is Dan.", with Dan referring to Dan Keeling, the A man who signed the band to Parlophone.|$|E

500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that after going on such a successful run you might not get over that last hurdle." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV {{stated that}} [...] "'Dress' {{continues}} [...] {{return to the}} soulful old-school sounds he championed in his early work" [...] and that [...] "West works an easy flow over the midtempo joint replete with feathery falsetto backing vocals an overall buttery '70s feel. Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said {{you are what you}} eat.' Kanye might be on his quest for love, but he still isn’t able to tolerate gold-digging girls who are only after his cash: 'And outta all the colors that are still up the skies/ You got green <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> I can see it in your eyes.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized. Wilson Follett included the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volume Stephen Crane: An Omnibus. The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalist Harold Frederic wrote in his review for The New York Times that [...] "even if he had written nothing else, [...] have placed [...] where he now undoubtedly stands." [...] English poet Robert Bridges likewise praised the story in his review for Life, stating that Crane [...] "has indelibly fixed the experience <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> and that is the test of a literary artisan". American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New York Evening Sun that [...] "those who have read 'The Open Boat' will forget every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the egg-shell changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group".|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy's voice {{appeared}} in sampled form on a song by the pop band Information Society {{in the late}} Eighties. The song, [...] "What's <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mind</b> (Pure Energy)" [...] (released in 1988), reached No. 3 on the US Pop charts, and No. 1 on the Dance charts.|$|E
2500|$|The late 1980s saw new sounds {{coming out}} of the state, when two singles from {{electronic}} band Information Society, [...] "What's <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mind?</b> (Pure Energy)" [...] and [...] "Walking Away", were MTV favorites. The Jayhawks are a long-lived country-roots rock band who started in the mid-1980s. Another group to form about the same time was Babes in Toyland, an early quasi-riot grrl band. Many groups of the 1980s and 1990s eventually split up, {{and a number of other}} bands formed from the remnants. [...] Bob Mould left Hüsker Dü after it imploded in 1988, to head Sugar and do solo projects. Trip Shakespeare eventually transformed into Semisonic, who gained popularity in the late 1990s with the song Closing Time. Other prominent, recent rock acts from Minnesota include slowcore band Low and Indie Folk/Bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles both from Duluth experimental rock band Cloud Cult and indie rockers Tapes 'n Tapes both from Minneapolis.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play {{as often as you}} did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did get to go to the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E
