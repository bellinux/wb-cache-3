40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This {{study has}} been {{concerned}} with the patterns of vegetative changes which occur during {{the first five years}} following logging and burning on Douglas-fir clear cuts. Knowledge of the successional sequence in the coastal forests of western Oregon is of primary importance to those concerned with the management of this resource. From the more theoretical point of view, there are many unique features associated with this type of vegetation of special interest to the ecologist. Published accounts of studies in Oregon and Washington have been of a generalized nature. None have approached a localized area with the degree of intensity attempted in this study. Due to its close proximity to Oregon State University and the cutting and burning history of the area, the Mary's Peak Watershed has been especially suitable for this study. Mary's Peak is the highest point of the Oregon Coast range having an elevation of 4, 097 feet. The Corvallis watershed is located on the eastern slope of the peak and includes both the Rock Creek and Griffith Creek drainages. The area is about five miles long east and west by four miles north and south. The area is managed as a unit by the United States Forest Service. Due to the marine influence, the area has a humid climate averaging approximately 65 inches of precipitation annually with an annual mean temperature of approximately 52 °F. Soils are basaltic in origin and are primarily clay loam in texture. In 1950, an epidemic of Douglas fir bark beetles made necessary a program of development which included cutting of dead and infected trees and establishing a road system. Cutting was restricted to small clear cuts. The vegetation in the study area is a Douglas fir-vine maple association. Gaultheria shallon and Berberis nervosa dominate the forest floor with traces of Castanopsis, Corylus, and Cornus. Study plots were located on nine clear cut and burned areas ranging in elevation from 1, 300 to 2, 800 feet and including north, south, and east exposures. Nineteen study plots, which were 100 x 100 feet, were established in uniform vegetative areas. Plots were also established in the undisturbed areas adjacent to the clear cuts for comparative purposes. Vegetative sampling was done using a device called an <b>ocular</b> <b>point</b> frame which provided a reliable indication of vegetative cover. Sampling was done in both the spring and fall on the second, third, fourth, and fifth years following burning. The stable undisturbed vegetation was sampled only once. Results of the five-year study showed a general increase in total number of plant species. The average total vegetative cover rose abruptly the third, fourth, and fifth years. An analysis indicated that south exposed plots had the greatest vegetative cover the first five years after burning. East plots ranked second and north plots third. By the fourth year, average cover values on clear cut areas exceeded the cover values of understory vegetation on the adjacent uncut forest. Analysis of data regarding seasonal variation indicated sharp decreases in total cover from spring to fall during the first three years. Increasing amounts of perennial vegetation during the fourth and fifth years reduced this seasonal variation markedly. In terms of mean cover trends, the annual herb, Senecio sylvaticus, dominated the second year; Lotus stipularis and Circium vulgare, the third; Lotus and Holcus lanatus, the fourth and fifth. All plant species indicated a wide range of cover values on the plots sampled. Some consistent trends in the sequence of cover dominance are noted...|$|E
40|$|Résumé publié in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 123 (5) 3320. International audienceDeixis, or pointing, is {{the ability}} to draw the viewer/listener?s {{attention}} to an object, a person, a direction or an event. Pointing is gradually acquired by children, first with the eyes, then with the finger, then with intonation and finally with syntax. The crucial role of digital pointing in language acquisition suggests that all modalities of pointing may share a common cerebral network. An fMRI study of the production of multimodal pointing was carried out on 15 subjects. Subjects were scanned during the execution of index finger pointing gestures, eye pointing gestures, prosodic pointing (focus) and syntactic pointing (extraction). The results of a random effect group analysis show that the left superior parietal lobule (BA 7) was activated in all three digital, <b>ocular</b> and prosodic <b>pointing</b> but not in syntactic pointing. These results indicate that pointing in different modalities may recruit the left superior parietal lobule, with <b>ocular</b> <b>pointing</b> more anterior than prosodic pointing, itself more anterior than digital pointing. A grammaticalisation process is suggested to explain the lack of parietal activation in syntactic pointing...|$|R

Methods: Two Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at {{a total of six}} separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1. 5 % (n= 78) or placebo (n= 79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15  minutes, 8  hours, or 16  hours prior to a CAC. Primary <b>ocular</b> end <b>points</b> included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7  minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20  minutes following each CAC. Secondary <b>ocular</b> end <b>points</b> included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects. Results: A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1. 5 % treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P< 0. 0001), while measures for onset and 8 -hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥ 1. 0  unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8 -hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient. Conclusion: BBOS 1. 5 % rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8  hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced. Keywords: allergen challenge, antihistamine, itching, Beprev...|$|R

40|$|Judgments {{of spatial}} {{relationships}} are often made when the object or observer are moving. Behaviourally, {{there is evidence}} that these ‘dynamic’ judgments of spatial extent differ from static judgments. Here I used three separate techniques for exploring dynamic judgments: first, a line bisection paradigm was employed to study <b>ocular</b> and <b>pointing</b> judgments of spatial extent while manipulating line length, position, speed, acceleration, and direction of scanning (Experiments 1 - 4); second, functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine whether distinct brain regions were involved in dynamic versus static judgments of spatial extent (Exp 5); and finally, a mathematical and computational model of dynamic judgments was developed to provide a framework for interpreting the experimental results. In the behavioural experiments, substantial differences were seen between static and dynamic bisection, suggesting the two invoke different neural processes for computing spatial extent. Surprisingly, <b>ocular</b> and <b>pointing</b> judgments produced distinct bisection patterns that were uncorrelated, with pointing somewhat more impervious to manipulations such as scan direction and position than ocular bisections. However, a new experimental task for probing dynamic judgments (the ‘no line’ Experiment 4) found that scan direction can influence both hand behaviour. Functional MRI demonstrated that dynamic relative to static judgments produced activations in the cuneus and precuneus bilaterally, left cerebellum, and medial frontal gyrus, with reduced activation relative to static judgments observed in the supramarginal gyrus bilaterally. Dynamic bisections relative to a control condition produced activations in the right precuneus and left cerebellum, as well as in left superior parietal lobule, left middle temporal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. It may be the case that velocity processing and temporal estimates are integrated primarily in the cuneus and precuneus bilaterally to produce estimates of spatial extent under dynamic scanning conditions. These results highlight the fact that dynamic judgments of spatial extent engage brain regions distinct from those employed to make static judgments, supporting the behavioural results that these are separate and distinct. Finally, a mathematical model was proposed for dynamic judgments of spatial extent, based on the idea that, rather than using an ‘all-or-none’ approach, spatial working memory actually takes about 100 ms to reach full representational strength for any given point in space. The model successfully explains many of the effects seen in the behavioural experiments including the effects of scan direction, velocity, line length, and position. In conjunction with the neuroimaging data, it also suggests why neglect patients may fail to show rightward bisection biases when making dynamic judgments of spatial extent. Overall, this work provides novel insights into how the brain executes dynamic judgments of spatial extent...|$|R
40|$|Several {{clinical}} scoring {{systems for}} diagnosis of {{bovine respiratory disease}} (BRD) in calves have been proposed. However, such systems were based on subjective judgment, rather than statistical methods, to weight scores. Data from a pair-matched case-control study on a California calf raising facility was used to develop three novel scoring systems to diagnose BRD in preweaned dairy calves. Disease status was assigned using both clinical signs and diagnostic test results for BRD-associated pathogens. Regression coefficients were used to weight score values. The systems presented use nasal and ocular discharge, rectal temperature, ear and head carriage, coughing, and respiratory quality as predictors. The systems developed in this research utilize fewer severity categories of clinical signs, require less calf handling, and had excellent agreement (Kappa > 0. 8) when compared to an earlier scoring system. The first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. The second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. The third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. The first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 <b>points),</b> <b>ocular</b> discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥ 39. 2 °C or 102. 5 °F, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized “BRD positive” if their total score was ≥ 4. This system correctly classified 95. 4 % cases and 88. 6 % controls. The second presented system categorized the predictors and assigned weights as follows: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), mild nasal discharge (unilateral, serous, or watery discharge, 3 points), moderate to severe nasal discharge (bilateral, cloudy, mucoid, mucopurlent, or copious discharge, 5 <b>points),</b> <b>ocular</b> discharge (any discharge, 1 point), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥ 39. 2 °C, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized “BRD positive” if their total score was ≥ 4. This system correctly classified 89. 3 % cases and 92. 8 % controls. The third presented system used the following predictors and scores: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), nasal discharge (any, 4 <b>points),</b> <b>ocular</b> discharge (any, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥ 39. 2 °C, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized “BRD positive” if their total score was ≥ 5. This system correctly classified 89. 4 % cases and 90. 8 % controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Hundred and twenty patients with head injury having ocular findings, presenting from December 2014 to July 2016, were taken for study. Detailed ophthalmological examination of the patients was carried out {{and the results of}} the study are depicted in the form of percentages, graphs and charts. RESULTS The most common cause of head injury found in our study was road traffic accident. The commonest eye finding was oedema and ecchymosis of eyelids. Prime causal factors affecting visual acuity found in our study were corneal tear, globe rupture, optic nerve injury and avulsion of eyeball. CONCLUSION Head injuries with ocular manifestations occur in younger age group. Road traffic accident was the most common cause. Males have to work outside their home for their jobs more than that of females. So they are more prone to accidents. Oedema and ecchymosis of eyelids constitute the most common ocular finding.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. There is no test for its definitive diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Although phase III clinical trials have failed, only symptomatic treatment is currently available; a possible reason for these failed trials is that intervention commenced at an advanced {{stage of the}} disease. The hallmarks of an AD brain include plaques comprising of extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein aggregates and intracellular hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles of tau. Research into the preclinical diagnosis of AD has provided considerable evidence regarding early neuropathological changes using brain Aβ imaging and the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, Aβ and tau. Both these approaches have limitations that are expensive, invasive or time consuming and thus preclude them from screening at-risk population. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of Aβ plaques {{in the eyes of}} AD subjects, which is positively associated with their brain Aβ burden. Thus <b>ocular</b> biomarkers <b>point</b> to a potential avenue for an earlier, relatively low-cost diagnosis in order for therapeutic interventions to be effective. Here we review the literature that spans the investigation for the presence of Aβ in aging eyes and the significance of its deposition in relation to AD pathology. We discuss clinical studies investigating in vivo imaging of Aβ in the eye and its association with brain Aβ burden and therapies that target ocular Aβ. Finally, we focus on the need to characterize AD-specific retinal Aβ to differentiate Aβ found in some eye diseases. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that integration of ocular biomarkers that can correctly predict brain Aβ burden would have an important role as a non-invasive, yet economical surrogate marker in the diagnostic process of AD...|$|R

40|$|Background: Though the {{development}} and fitting of scleral contact lenses are expanding steadily, there is ﻿no simple method to provide scleral metrics for scleral contact lens fitting yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish formulae for estimation of the axial radius of curvature (ARC) of the anterior sclera using ocular biometric parameters that can be easily obtained with conventional devices. Methods: A semi-automated stitching method and a computational analysis tool for calculating ARC were developed by using the ImageJ and MATLAB software. The ARC of all the <b>ocular</b> surface <b>points</b> were analyzed from the composite horizontal cross-sectional images of the right eyes of 24 volunteers; these measurements were obtained using anterior segment optical coherence tomography for a previous study (AS-OCT; Visante). Ocular biometric parameters were obtained from the same volunteers with slit-scanning topography and partial coherence interferometry. Correlation analysis was performed between the ARC at 8  mm to the axis line (ARC[8]) and other ocular parameters (including age). With ARC obtained on several nasal and temporal points (7. 0, 7. 5, 8. 0, 8. 5, and 9. 0  mm from the axis line), univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to develop a model for estimating ARC with the help of ocular biometric parameters. Results: Axial length, spherical equivalent, and angle kappa showed correlations with temporal ARC[8] (tARC[8]; Pearson’s r[*]=[*] 0. 653, − 0. 579, and − 0. 341; P[*]=[*] 0. 001, 0. 015, and 0. 015, respectively). White-to-white corneal diameter (WTW) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) showed correlation with nasal ARC[8] (nARC[8]; Pearson’s r[*]=[*]− 0. 492 and − 0. 461; P[*]=[*] 0. 015 and 0. 023, respectively). The formulae for estimating scleral curvatures (tARC, nARC, and average ARC) were developed as a function of axial length, ACD, WTW, and distance from the axis line, with good determinant power (72 [*]−[*] 80  %; SPSS ver. 22. 0). Angle kappa showed strong correlation with axial length (Pearson’s r[*]=[*]− 0. 813, P < 0. 001), and the different correlation patterns of nasal and temporal ARC with axial length can be explained by the ocular surface deviation represented by angle kappa. Conclusions: Axial length, ACD, and WTW are useful parameters for estimating the ARC of the anterior sclera, which is important for the haptic design of scleral contact lenses.

40|$|International audienceAmong the {{different}} prosodic phenomena, prosodic focus, {{which is very}} often used in speech communication, deserves particular attention. It attracts the listener/viewer's attention to relevant elements in the discourse. It is a means to designate, identify or select an element (see e. g., Halliday, 1967; Gussenhoven, 1983; Selkirk, 1984; Nølke, 1994; Birch & Clifton, 1995; Ladd, 1996). In this sense, prosodic focus is related to pointing or deixis. Pointing is a universal ability which orients the attention of another person so that an object/person/direction/event becomes the shared focus of attention. It serves to single out, to individuate what will become the referent. A pointing gesture is most often performed with the index finger and arm extended {{in the direction of}} the interesting object and with the other fingers curled inside the hand (Butterworth, 2003). But pointing can also be vocal or linguistic. Linguists define deixis as the way language expresses reference to points in time, space or events (Fillmore, 1997). In its narrow sense, deixis refers to the contextual meaning of deictic words, which include pronouns, place deictics, time deictics and demonstratives. In its broad sense, it provides a means to highlight relevant elements in the discourse, to designate, identify or select an element. In French, as in many languages, broad sense deixis can be conveyed by syntactic extraction or prosodic focus (Berthoud, 1990). Syntactic extraction involves the use of a cleft presentation form such as in the example below: C'est Madeleine qui m'amena (It's Madeleine who brought me along.) Deixis can also be conveyed by contrastive prosodic focus, i. e. by using a specific intonational contour on the pointed item, such as in the example below: MADELEINEF m'amena. (MADELEINEF brought me along.) The effect of this intonational contour is to highlight the pointed item ("Madeleine"), the rest of the utterance bearing a flat, post-focal contour. Compared with a broad focus or non-deictic rendition of an utterance, prosodic focus involves precise acoustic and articulatory modifications. It has been shown that speakers use reliable proprioceptive strategies to organize phonation and articulation adequately in order to convey prosodic focus (see e. g. Dohen et al., 2006). On the perception side, visual only and auditory-visual perception tests carried out in our department (Dohen & Lœvenbruck, 2005; in press) have shown that these phonatory and articulatory patterns are not just productive habits but that they are recovered by listeners/viewers and used for prosodic focus detection. It should be mentioned that syntactic extraction may or not be accompanied by prosodic focus. The use of a specific (stored) linguistic construction can convey a pointing meaning, without the need for specific somatosensory (acoustic and articulatory) change, with respect to a non-deictic utterance. Interestingly, pointing is involved at several stages of human communication development. <b>Ocular</b> <b>pointing</b> (or deictic gazes, at 6 - 9 months) and, later, index finger-pointing (deictic gestures, at 9 - 11 months) have been shown to be two key stages in infant cognitive development that are correlated with stages in oral speech development. Pointing seems to be one of the first communicative tools used by babies (e. g. Bates et al., 1975; Bruner, 1975; Hewes, 1981; Kita, 2003; Tomasello et al., 2007). It is a key part of the shared attention mechanism in child-adult interaction. It seems to emerge spontaneously, in stages, and in association with oral productions. The crucial role of index-finger pointing in language development suggests that vocal pointing may share features in common with manual pointing, and typically may be grounded in close cerebral tissues. Our aim is to better understand the cerebral correlates of the production of prosodic and syntactic focus in French. We make the hypothesis that integrated representations (acoustic, articulatory, proprioceptive) may be needed in order to produce prosodic pointing adequately and that these multisensory representations may be formed via the activation of associative cerebral areas. Syntactic extraction may not necessitate such a network. A first preliminary fMRI study of the production of prosodic focus and syntactic extraction is presented. It shows that prosodic pointing seems to recruit a left temporo-parieto-frontal network whereas grammaticalized syntactic pointing mainly involves frontal regions. The exploratory results of a recent study of multimodal <b>pointing</b> (digital, <b>ocular,</b> prosodic and syntactic) are then presented, which provides convergent results. Altogether these findings suggest that speakers may use multisensory representations in order to produce prosodic focus (pointing) adequately, just like they do to produce a manual or ocular gesture. These representations may be formed via the activation of associative parietal areas. The lack of parietal activation in syntactic pointing could be due to the absence of on-line multisensory construction in syntactic pointing, compared with prosodic pointing. Syntactic pointing uses a grammaticalized "frozen" construction and may not need integrated representations to be formed. These fMRI study therefore shed light on the complementary relationship between syntax and prosody, with syntactic focus conceived as more "stored" and prosodic focus as more "built on-line"...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the ocular findings in children between 3 and 5 {{years of age}} who had received phototherapy in the neonatal period and to investigate whether they had phototherapy-related permanent ocular damage clinically. Methods: The phototherapy group (n =  57) consisted of children who had undergone phototherapy for at least 24  h, and the control group (n =  43) comprised children who had not received phototherapy. Ophthalmic examinations consisted of assessment of visual acuity, convergence near <b>point,</b> <b>ocular</b> movements, ocular alignment, dynamic retinoscopy, cycloplegic refraction and biomicroscopic examination of anterior segment and posterior segment (using a 90 D lens in the latest). Results: All children were orthophoric and had normal eye movements. A {{significant difference was found}} between the phototherapy group and control group regarding convergence near point 3. 0 (2. 0 – 5. 0) vs 3. 0 (2. 0 – 5. 0) (p =  0. 018), right cycloplegic spherical equivalent 1. 0 (0. 0 – 3. 0) vs 0. 75 (0. 0 – 4. 75) (p =  0. 011) and left cycloplegic spherical equivalent 1. 0 (0. 075 – 3. 0) vs 0. 75 (0. 0 – 5. 25) (p =  0. 006). The study groups were similar according to cycloplegic spherical and cylindrical refractions. However, no significant difference was found between the groups regarding the need for eye glasses. Conclusion: Although there were significant differences between the phototherapy and the control groups according to the convergence near point and right and the left eye cycloplegic spherical equivalent, the similarity between the groups regarding the need for eyeglasses suggested that difference was clinically insignificant...|$|R
40|$|Good {{visual acuity}} {{requires}} that the axial length of the ocular globe is matched to the refractive power of the cornea and lens to focus the images of distant objects onto the retina. During {{the growth of the}} juvenile eye, this is achieved through the emmetropization process that adjusts the ocular axial length to compensate for the refractive changes that occur in the anterior segment. A failure of the emmetropization process can result in either excessive or insufficient axial growth, leading to myopia or hyperopia, respectively. Emmetropization is mainly regulated by the retina, which generates two opposite signals: "GO/GROW" signals to increase axial growth and "STOP" signals to block it. The presence of GO/GROW and STOP signals was investigated by a proteomics analysis of the retinas from chicken with experimental myopia and hyperopia. Of 18 differentially expressed proteins that were identified, five displayed an expression profile corresponding to GO/GROW signals, and two corresponded to STOP signals. Western blotting confirmed that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has the characteristics of a STOP signal both in the retina {{as well as in the}} fibrous sclera. In accordance with this, intraocular application of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist GW 7647 resulted in up-regulation of apoA-I levels and in a significant reduction of experimental myopia. In conclusion, using a comprehensive functional proteomics analysis of chicken ocular growth models we identified targets for ocular growth control. The correlation of elevated apoA-I levels with reduced <b>ocular</b> axial growth <b>points</b> toward a functional relationship with the observed morphological changes of the eye...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To compare visual efficiency, {{specifically}} accom-modation, vergence, and oculomotor functions among {{athletes and}} non-athletes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on sports vision screening {{was used to}} evaluate the visual skills of 214 elementary students (107 athletes, 107 non-athletes), aged between 13 and 16 y. The visual screening assessed visual parameters such as ocular motor alignment, accommodation, and vergence functions. RESULTS: Mean visual parameters were compared between age-group matched athletes (mean age 14. 82 ± 0. 98 y) and non-athletes (mean age 15. 00 ± 1. 04 y). The refractive errors of all participants were corrected to maximal attainable best corrected visual acuity of logMAR 0. 0. Accommodation function assessment evaluated amplitude of accommodation and accommodation facility. Vergence functions measured the near point of convergence, vergence facility, and distance fusional vergence at break and recovery <b>point.</b> <b>Ocular</b> motor alignment was not statistically significant between both groups. Athletes had a statistically significant amplitude of accommodation for both the right eye (t= 2. 30, P= 0. 02) and the left eye (t= 1. 99, P= 0. 05). Conversely, non-athletes had better accommodation facility (t=- 2. 54, P= 0. 01) and near point of convergence (t= 4. 39, P< 0. 001) when compared to athletes. Vergence facility was found to be better among athletes (t= 2. 47, P= 0. 01). Nevertheless, non-athletes were significantly better for both distance negative and positive fusional vergence. CONCLUSION: Although the findings are still inconclusive as to whether athletes had superior visual skills as compared to non-athletes, it remains important to identify and elucidate the key visual skills needed by athletes {{in order for them to}} achieve higher performance in their sports...|$|R
40|$|Aims - To compare reading {{performance}} {{in children with}} and without visual function anomalies and identify the influence of abnormal visual function and other variables in reading ability. Methods - A cross-sectional study was carried in 110 children of school age (6 - 11 years) with Abnormal Visual Function (AVF) and 562 children with Normal Visual Function (NVF). An orthoptic assessment (visual acuity, <b>ocular</b> alignment, near <b>point</b> of convergence and accommodation, stereopsis and vergences) and autorefraction was carried out. Oral reading was analyzed (list of 34 words). Number of errors, accuracy (percentage of success) and reading speed (words per minute - wpm) were used as reading indicators. Sociodemographic information from parents (n= 670) and teachers (n= 34) was obtained. Results - Children with AVF had a higher number of errors (AVF= 3. 00 errors; NVF= 1. 00 errors; p< 0. 001), a lower accuracy (AVF= 91. 18 %; NVF= 97. 06 %; p< 0. 001) and reading speed (AVF= 24. 71 wpm; NVF= 27. 39 wpm; p= 0. 007). Reading speed in the 3 rd school grade was not statistically different {{between the two groups}} (AVF= 31. 41 wpm; NVF= 32. 54 wpm; p= 0. 113). Children with uncorrected hyperopia (p= 0. 003) and astigmatism (p= 0. 019) had worst {{reading performance}}. Children in 2 nd, 3 rd, or 4 th grades presented a lower risk of having reading impairment when compared with the 1 st grade. Conclusion - Children with AVF had reading impairment in the first school grade. It seems that reading abilities have a wide variation and this disparity lessens in older children. The slow reading characteristics of the children with AVF are similar to dyslexic children, which suggest the need for an eye evaluation before classifying the children as dyslexic...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of rupatadine (RUP) versus desloratadine (DES) in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Method: To assess the efficacy and safety of RUP in SAR in comparison with placebo (PL) and DES. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, international, and PL-controlled study was carried out. The main selection criteria included SAR patients over 12 years old with a positive prick test to a relevant seasonal allergen for the geographic area. Symptomatic patients at screening with a nasal symptom sum score of &ge; 6 points (nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneezing, and nasal pruritus), a non-nasal score of &ge; 3 <b>points</b> (<b>ocular</b> pruritus, ocular redness, and tearing eyes), and a rhinorrhea score of &ge; 2 points with laboratory test results and electrocardiography within acceptable limits were included in the study. Change from baseline in the total symptom-score (T 7 SS) over the 4 -week treatment period (reflective evaluation) was considered the primary efficacy variable. Secondary efficacy measures included total nasal symptom score (T 4 NSS) and conjunctival symptom score (T 3 NNSS), both of which are reflective and instantaneous evaluations. Furthermore questions related to quality of life (eg, sleep disturbances or impairment of daily activities) have also been evaluated. Safety was assessed according to adverse events reported, as well as laboratory and electrocardiography controls. Results: A total of 379 patients were randomized, of which 356 were included and allocated to PL (n = 122), RUP (n = 117), or DES (n = 117). Mean change of T 7 SS over the 4 -week treatment period was significantly reduced in the RUP (&minus; 46. 1 %, P = 0. 03) and DES (&minus; 48. 9 %, P = 0. 01) groups, compared with PL. Similarly, RUP and DES were comparable and significantly superior to PL for all secondary endpoints, including nasal and conjunctival symptoms and patients&rsquo; and investigator&rsquo;s overall clinical opinions. Symptom score evaluation (both reflective and instantaneous evaluations) throughout the treatment period showed a progressive and maintained significant improvement with both treatments at day 7 (P = 0. 01), day 14 (P = 0. 007), and day 21 (P = 0. 01) in comparison with PL. Adverse events were scarce and were similar in both treatment groups. Electrocardiography (QTc) and lab test results did not show any relevant findings. Conclusion: RUP is a very good choice for SAR due to its contribution to the improvement of nasal (including obstruction) and non-nasal symptoms to a similar degree as DES.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{investigate}} the effect of prolonged reading on reading performance and visual functions in students with low vision. The study focuses {{on one of the most}} common modes of achieving adequate magnification for reading by students with low vision, their close reading distance (proximal or relative distance magnification). Close reading distances impose high demands on near visual functions, such as accommodation and convergence. Previous research on accommodation in children with low vision shows that their accommodative responses are reduced compared to normal vision. In addition, there is an increased lag of accommodation for higher stimulus levels as may occur at close reading distance. Reduced accommodative responses in low vision and higher lag of accommodation at close reading distances together could impact on reading performance of students with low vision especially during prolonged reading tasks. The presence of convergence anomalies could further affect reading performance. Therefore, the aims of the present study were 1) To investigate the effect of prolonged reading on reading performance in students with low vision 2) To investigate the effect of prolonged reading on visual functions in students with low vision. This study was conducted as cross-sectional research on 42 students with low vision and a comparison group of 20 students with normal vision, aged 7 to 20 years. The students with low vision had vision impairments arising from a range of causes and represented a typical group of students with low vision, with no significant developmental delays, attending school in Brisbane, Australia. All participants underwent a battery of clinical tests before and after a prolonged reading task. An initial reading-specific history and pre-task measurements that included Bailey-Lovie distance and near visual acuities, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity, ocular deviations, sensory fusion, <b>ocular</b> motility, near <b>point</b> of accommodation (pull-away method), accuracy of accommodation (Monocular Estimation Method (MEM)) retinoscopy and Near Point of Convergence (NPC) (push-up method) were recorded for all participants. Reading performance measures were Maximum Oral Reading Rates (MORR), Near Text Visual Acuity (NTVA) and acuity reserves using Bailey-Lovie text charts. Symptoms of visual fatigue were assessed using the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) for all participants. Pre-task measurements of reading performance and accuracy of accommodation and NPC were compared with post-task measurements, to test for any effects of prolonged reading. The prolonged reading task involved reading a storybook silently for at least 30 minutes. The task was controlled for print size, contrast, difficulty level and content of the reading material. Silent Reading Rate (SRR) was recorded every 2 minutes during prolonged reading. Symptom scores and visual fatigue scores were also obtained for all participants. A visual fatigue analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess visual fatigue during the task, once at the beginning, once at the middle and once at the end of the task. In addition to the subjective assessments of visual fatigue, tonic accommodation was monitored using a photorefractor (PlusoptiX CR 03 ™) every 6 minutes during the task, as an objective assessment of visual fatigue. Reading measures were done at the habitual reading distance of students with low vision and at 25 cms for students with normal vision. The initial history showed that the students with low vision read for significantly shorter periods at home compared to the students with normal vision. The working distances of participants with low vision ranged from 3 - 25 cms and half of them were not using any optical devices for magnification. Nearly half of the participants with low vision were able to resolve 8 -point print (1 M) at 25 cms. Half of the participants in the low vision group had ocular deviations and suppression at near. Reading rates were significantly reduced in students with low vision compared to those of students with normal vision. In addition, there were a significantly larger number of participants in the low vision group who could not sustain the 30 -minute task compared to the normal vision group. However, there were no significant changes in reading rates during or following prolonged reading in either the low vision or normal vision groups. Individual changes in reading rates were independent of their baseline reading rates, indicating that the changes in reading rates during prolonged reading cannot be predicted from a typical clinical assessment of reading using brief reading tasks. Contrary to previous reports the silent reading rates of the students with low vision were significantly lower than their oral reading rates, although oral and silent reading was assessed using different methods. Although the visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, near point of convergence and accuracy of accommodation were significantly poorer for the low vision group compared to those of the normal vision group, there were no significant changes in any of these visual functions following prolonged reading in either group. Interestingly, a few students with low vision (n = 10) were found to be reading at a distance closer than their near point of accommodation. This suggests a decreased sensitivity to blur. Further evaluation revealed that the equivalent intrinsic refractive errors (an estimate of the spherical dioptirc defocus which would be expected to yield a patient’s visual acuity in normal subjects) were significantly larger for the low vision group compared to those of the normal vision group. As expected, accommodative responses were significantly reduced for the low vision group compared to the expected norms, which is consistent with their close reading distances, reduced visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. For those in the low vision group who had an accommodative error exceeding their equivalent intrinsic refractive errors, a significant decrease in MORR was found following prolonged reading. The silent reading rates however were not significantly affected by accommodative errors in the present study. Suppression also had a significant impact on the changes in reading rates during prolonged reading. The participants who did not have suppression at near showed significant decreases in silent reading rates during and following prolonged reading. This impact of binocular vision at near on prolonged reading was possibly due to the high demands on convergence. The significant predictors of MORR in the low vision group were age, NTVA, reading interest and reading comprehension, accounting for 61. 7...|$|R
