50|$|There are {{two main}} inequalities as pointed out by Amartya Sen: {{educational}} inequality and health inequality. These are the indicators of a woman's status of welfare. In India irrespective of the caste, creed, religion and social status, the overall status of a woman is lower than men and therefore a male child is preferred over a female child. A male child is considered a blessing and his birth is celebrated {{as opposed to a}} female child where her birth is not celebrated and is considered more of a burden. Therefore, education and health care of the female child in India is an important social indicator to measure equality between men and women. According to the 2001 Indian census, <b>overall</b> <b>male-female</b> <b>ratio</b> was 927 females per 1000 males. However, the 2011 Indian census shows that there are 914 females per 1000 males.During the last decade the number of female children to male children in the youngest age group fell from 945 per 1000 males to 927 females per 1000 males.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{almost no}} {{epidemiologic}} {{data are available}} on the prevalence or incidence of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in the general population. Therefore, a registration programme of ILD-prevalence was organised by the VRGT (Vereniging voor Respiratoire Gezondheidszorg en Tuberculosebestrijding), among about 100 Flemish pneumologists since 1990. Most categories of the classification by Crystal et al. (1) were included and the diagnostic criteria (histology, laboratory tests, clinic, radiology) were registered. The present paper presents the results of 1992 - 1994 : twenty pneumologists had forwarded the summary files of 237 patients to the central office in 1992 (n = 68), 1993 (n = 90) and 1994 (n = 79). The diagnoses that were most frequently made were: sarcoidosis in 27 %, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 20 %, hypersensitivity pneumonitis in 14 % (of which 68 % by birds) and collagen-vascular disease in 10 % (of which 54 % in rheumatoid arthritis). Less frequent causes were eosinophilic pneumonia (4 %), inhalation of inorganic material (4 %, anthracosilicosis being excluded), histiocytosis X (3 %), drugs (3 %), angiitis and granulomatosis (2 %), pulmonary hemosiderosis (1 %), lymphocytic infiltrative lung disease (1 %) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (1 %). The order of relative frequencies of the different categories of diseases was the same in the 3 registration years. In 9 % of the patients the diagnosis was confined to "undefined fibrosis". The diagnosis was confirmed by histology in 63 % of the cases. The <b>overall</b> <b>male-female</b> <b>ratio</b> was nearly one, with, however, a male preponderance in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (22 / 12), UIP(8 / 3) and "undefined fibrosis" (14 / 7).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{the pattern of}} intra-oral carcinomas diagnosed in north-eastern Nigeria. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective clinical and histopathological review seen in a tertiary care hospital (January 1987 -December 2002). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on socio-demographic characteristics of patients and details of cancer management were retrieved from the files and histopathology records of cases diagnosed at the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 378 biopsies, 317 primary cancers including 279 carcinomas {{of the head and}} neck were diagnosed during the study period. Intra-oral carcinomas constitute 43 (15. 4 %) of all head and neck carcinomas reported, with no occurrence in children. The overall mean age of occurrence was 51. 2 +/- 15. 6 years (male = 56. 2 +/- 13. 7 years; females = 47. 5 +/- 16. 2 years) and an <b>overall</b> <b>male-female</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3 : 4. Carcinomas were commonly reported in the palate 19 (44. 2 %) and lip six (13. 9 %) and floor of mouth four (9. 3 %). Squamous cell carcinoma 28 (65. 1 %), adenoidcystic carcinoma seven (16. 3 %) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma five (11. 6 %) were the commonly reported carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common carcinoma in all sites, in the sixth decade of life, of equal gender distribution and commonly reported in users of kola nuts and tobacco. The occupation of patients diagnosed with oral carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was farming (50 %, 61. 5 %). All the staged cancers patients (n = 7) reported in the late stages (III/IV) of the disease. The mean interval between symptoms and presentation for the different carcinomas ranged between 9 and 25 months, with the least interval reported for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common oral carcinoma, commonly reported in the palate, among farmers and in the sixth decade of life. Its occurrence in under 40 year olds is three to six times greater than reported for the USA and Europe and may be associated with poor diet and the habitual use of kola nuts and tobacco. The survival rates of patients diagnosed with intra-oral carcinomas, although not available, would be expectedly low in view of the prognostic indicators recorded in this series. The routine oral cancer screening of each patient, and counselling of patients with high-risk habits, by dentists is recommended to improve the prognosis of the disease.

We specifically studied the differences in <b>male-female</b> <b>ratio,</b> age, TNM-stage, site distribution, and alcohol and tobacco use. Materials and Methods: Patients from the VU University Medical Center with an oral squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity registered in 1980 - 1984 (n= 200), group 1, were compared to patients registered in 2000 - 2004 (n= 184), group 2. Trends in prevalence, site distribution, TNM-stage, alcohol and tobacco use, age and gender were studied. Results: The <b>male-female</b> <b>ratio</b> has decreased from 1. 8 to 1. 2. There were no differences in age {{between the two groups}} of patients. The site distribution was similar in both groups. The most commonly involved sites were the tongue and the floor of mouth. In group 2 more patients were diagnosed with a T 1 tumour. There were no differences in tobacco use between the two different groups. There were much more light drinkers (0 - 2 drinks per day) in group 2 than in group 1, whereas there were more heavy drinkers (> 4 per day) in group 1 than in group 2 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Food allergy may {{be defined}} as an {{immunoglobulin}} EYmediated immune response to food proteins. Such studies have previously not been done in Calcutta, India. The present study was therefore undertaken to record the sensitivity to commonly consumed foods in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Materials and Methods: A survey of 800 patients (410 males and 390 females) reporting to the Allergy Unit of the Institute of Child Health, Calcutta, were selected for the study conducted from May 2006 to April 2007. Respiratory allergic patients in {{the age group of}} 5 to 60 years were evaluated using a standard questionnaire, and skin prick test was performed using common food and aeroallergens. Results/Conclusions: Out of the 684 patients with a history of food allergy, most of them, that is, 338, are in the age group 16 to 40 years, 192 of them were in the age group 41 to 60 years, and 154 were in the age group 5 to 15 years. Most of the patients with food allergy had asthma (65. 05 %), rhinitis and asthma (20. 03 %), and skin allergies (4. 97 %), such as itching, eczema, and urticaria. The foodstuffs that were found to elicit symptoms of hypersensitivity were egg, milk, wheat, pulses, vegetables, fishes, and fruits. The patients aged between 16 and 40 years (<b>male-female</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1 : 1. 19) were mostly sensitive to prawn, brinjal, banana, ladyfinger, papaya, wheat, and egg. The age group 41 to 60 years (<b>male-female</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1 : 1. 04) had high skin reactivity to brinjal, egg, banana, fish, and Phaseolus mungo.
