This article presents a method, which exploits compressed sensing and dictionary learning to achieve energy efficiency in the scenario of data aggregation in WSN, where sensor node measures different sensors data. We demonstrate performance analysis of multiple sensors method with metrics, probability of successful recovery and network transmission cost. Extensive simulations on practical data set shows that our data aggregation method for practical scenario can deliver data to sink with minimum transmission cost which inherently saves significant energy to prolong the network lifetime. The probability of successful recovery shows that our method can recover compressed data with maximum probability...|$|R
40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans {{mitochondrial}} (Mit) mutants have disrupted mitochondrial electron {{transport chain}} (<b>ETC)</b> <b>functionality,</b> yet, surprisingly, they are long lived. We have previously proposed that Mit mutants supplement their energy needs by exploiting alternate energy production pathways normally used by wild-type animals only {{when exposed to}} hypoxic conditions. We have also proposed that longevity in the Mit mutants arises as a property of their new metabolic state. If longevity does arise {{as a function of}} metabolic state, we would expect to find a common metabolic signature among these animals. To test these predictions, we established a novel approach monitoring the C. elegans exometabolism as a surrogate marker for internal metabolic events. Using HPLC-ultraviolet-based metabolomics and multivariate analyses, we show that long-lived clk- 1 (qm 30) and isp- 1 (qm 150) Mit mutants have a common metabolic profile that is distinct from that of aerobically cultured wild-type animals and, unexpectedly, wild-type animals cultured under severe oxygen deprivation. Moreover, we show that 2 short-lived mitochondrial ETC mutants, mev- 1 (kn 1) and ucr- 2. 3 (pk 732), also share a common metabolic signature that is unique. We show that removal of soluble fumarate reductase unexpectedly increases health span in several genetically defined Mit mutants, identifying at least 1 alternate energy production pathway, malate dismutation, that is operative in these animals. Our study suggests long-lived, genetically specified Mit mutants employ a novel metabolism and that life span may well arise as a function of metabolic state. —Butler, J. A., Ventura, N., Johnson, T.

This includes physical characteristics (hand size, mobility, flexibility, strength, etc.), sensory performance and cognitive abilities (Fujioka et al., 2015; Food and Drug Administration, 2017). The application of information about human capabilities and limitations to device design in order to optimize a device’s performance and safety is known as human factors engineering or usability engineering (Lange et al., 2015; Russ et al., 2013). Usability is “the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (International Standardization Organization, 1998). In this sense, usability goes beyond a device’s design (the legibility of text, shape, colors, <b>etc.)</b> and <b>functionality.</b> The concept of usability is more general, and deals with the match between a device and the users’ needs (Beuscart-Zéphir et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{demands on}} storage systems are {{increasingly}} re-quiring expressiveness, fault-tolerance, security, distribu-tion, <b>etc.</b> Such <b>functionalities</b> have been traditionally pro-vided by DBMS.

The primary problem in block storage management is block virtualiza-tion {{which is essentially}} an abstraction layer that sepa-rates the user view of storage from the implementation of storage. Storage virtualization standardizes storage man-agement in a heterogeneous storage and/or host environ-ment, and {{plays a crucial role}} in enhancing storage func-tionality and utilization. Currently specialized hardware or microcode based solutions are popular for implementing block storage management systems, commonly referred to as disk controllers. We demonstrate how to take a gen-eral purpose commercial RDBMS, rather than a special-ized solution, to support block storage management. We ex-ploit the simple semantics of storage management systems to streamline database performance and thus attain accept-ability from a storage point of view.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the use of}} COTS microkernels in fault-tolerant, and, to some extent, safety-critical systems. The main issue is to assess the behavior of such components, upon which application software rely, {{in the presence of}} faults.
