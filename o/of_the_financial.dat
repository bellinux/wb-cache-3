The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard.

The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks.

5|$|Smallpeice, {{with support}} from E. H.

5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.

The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{scientific}} principles <b>of</b> reproducing <b>the</b> total <b>financial</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{country and its}} effective form is an urgent problem both in theoretical and practical aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> which is intended to ensure the active mobilization and effective use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>financial</b> potential <b>of</b> Ukraine, {{and as a result}} — its expanded reproduction as well, which would contribute to realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal capacities for stabilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national economy. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article is disclosing <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effective form <b>of</b> reproducing <b>the</b> total <b>financial</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, analyzing <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> reproducing <b>the</b> total <b>financial</b> potential <b>of</b> Ukraine.

At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices.

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> district during the late 1880s and early 1890s.

In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E

However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.

Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983.
