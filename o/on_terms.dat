5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree <b>on</b> <b>terms.</b> The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} restricted {{versions of}} ground tree transducers: total, deterministic, and symmetric subclasses {{and all other}} subclasses created by applying any combination of these restrictions. We present the inclusion diagram of the tree transformation classes induced by these restricted ground tree transducers. We show that the following four classes of term relations are the same: (i) tree transformations induced by symmetric deterministic ground tree transducers, (ii) congruence relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras induced by reduced ground term rewriting systems, (iii) congruence relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras induced by convergent ground term rewriting systems, and (iv) finitely generated congruence relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras. As a by-product of our results, we obtain a new ground completion algorithm. Moreover, we show that the following three classes of <b>term</b> relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras {{with at least one}} non-nullary function symbol are also the same: (i) tree transformations induced by total symmetric deterministic ground tree transducers, (ii) congruence relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras of finite index, (iii) finitely generated congruence relations <b>on</b> <b>term</b> algebras of which the trunk is the whole set of terms...|$|R

5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E

5|$|At {{a series}} of {{high-level}} meetings in May, the Big Six first seriously discussed ending the war—but none of them <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> {{that would have been}} acceptable to the Allies. Because anyone openly supporting Japanese surrender risked assassination by zealous army officers, the meetings were closed to anyone except the Big Six, the Emperor, and the Privy Seal—no second- or third-echelon officers could attend. At these meetings, despite the dispatches from Japanese ambassador Satō in Moscow, only Foreign minister Tōgō realized that Roosevelt and Churchill might have already made concessions to Stalin to bring the Soviets into the war against Japan. As a result of these meetings, Tōgō was authorized to approach the Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its neutrality, or (despite the very remote probability) to form an alliance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi took {{leadership}} of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him {{and tens of thousands}} of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> that Gandhi disapproved.|$|E

5000|$|We may define {{bargaining}} power (of A, let us say) {{as being the}} cost to B of disagreeing <b>on</b> A's <b>terms</b> relative to the costs of agreeing <b>on</b> A's <b>terms</b> ... Stated in another way, a (relatively) high cost to B of disagreement with A means that A's {{bargaining power}} is strong. A (relatively) high cost of agreement means that A's bargaining power is weak. Such statements in themselves, however, reveal nothing of the strength or weakness of A relative to B, since B might similarly possess a strong or weak bargaining power.

After becoming an unrestricted free agent, Parise signed a 13-year contract worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild. The move represented a homecoming for Parise, {{who grew up in}} the twin cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul and whose father J. P. Parisé once captained the Minnesota North Stars. Parise joined fellow free agent signee Ryan Suter in signing with the Wild; Suter signed <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> identical to Parise's deal. Parise would wear number 11 with the Wild, the same number that his father J. P. wore with the North Stars, as number 9 was already taken by team captain Mikko Koivu.

5|$|In 376, a large band of Goths asked Emperor Valens for {{permission}} to settle on the southern bank of the Danube River <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as foederati; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such foederati troops to supplement its forces. In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up en masse as allied contingents of laeti and foederatii troops separate from existing Roman units. Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as Constantine III, Constantius III, Aetius and Bonifacius resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more taxable land to foederati.|$|E
5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently.

The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> that neither company would reveal.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene {{to agree to a}} three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused her attention to the Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798, <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> similar to those of 782.|$|E

Callixtus declined to support Louis, however, and merely advised the two rulers to seek peace. Amaury de Montfort came to terms with Henry, but Henry and William Clito failed to find a mutually satisfactory compromise. In June 1120, Henry and Louis formally made peace <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> advantageous to the English King: William Adelin gave homage to Louis, and in return Louis confirmed William's rights to the Duchy.|$|E

This paper explores whether term proximity features based <b>on</b> approximate <b>term</b> positions are as effective as those based <b>on</b> exact <b>term</b> positions. We introduce the novel notion of approximate positional indexes based on dividing documents into coarse-grained buckets and recording term positions with respect to those buckets. We propose different approaches to defining the buckets and compactly encoding bucket ids. In the context of linear ranking functions, experimental results show that features based <b>on</b> approximate <b>term</b> positions are able to achieve effectiveness comparable to exact term positions, but with smaller indexes and faster query evaluation...|$|R

5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta <b>on</b> <b>terms</b> that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
