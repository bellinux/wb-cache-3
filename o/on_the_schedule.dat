5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>schedule.</b> Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E
5|$|He participated {{as one of}} {{the four}} quarterbacks in the July 2011 Gridiron Kings event at Disney World (with the top 24 quarterbacks {{participating}} in the 2011 Elite 11), but he was overshadowed by Matt Davis. As a junior in the fall of 2011, he passed for 1,684 yards and 19 touchdowns. He led the team to the 2011 Division 1 MHSAA state quarterfinals where they lost 96 to eventual state champions Cass Technical High School. Prior to his senior season, he was regarded {{as one of the}} best quarterback prospects produced by the state of Michigan, a state whose greatest quarterback products have been Gary Danielson, Earl Morrall, Craig Morton and James Ninowski. From the start of ESPN's rankings with the class of 2006 through the class of 2012, no Michigan quarterback ever ranked in the top 100. The closest were Rob Bolden (112th, 2010) and Gardner (128th, 2010). Prior to his senior year, he was ranked as ESPN's 37th best and Rivals.com's 17th best prospect and rising in the national class of 2013. Entering his senior season, he and Max Browne were the only two 5-star rated quarterbacks in the class of 2013 by Rivals.com. A few weeks into his senior season, he had risen to 26th at ESPN, but suffered season-ending mononucleosis with five games remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>schedule.</b> By the beginning of November, he was the top quarterback in the country according to some evaluators. He ended his high school career ranked 127th by ESPN and 81st by Rivals.com.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a Bayesian {{framework}} for iden- tification of linear parameter-varying (LPV) models with fi- nite impulse response (FIR) dynamic structure is introduced, {{in which the}} dependency structure of LPV system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> variables is identified based on a Gaussian Process (GP) formulation. Using this approach, a GP is employed to describe {{the distribution of the}} coefficient functions, that are dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> variables, in LPV linear- regression models. First, a prior distribution over the nonlinear functions representing the unknown coefficient dependencies of the model to be estimated is defined; then, a posterior distribution of these functions is obtained given measured data. The mean value of the posterior distribution is used to provide a model estimate. The approach is formulated with both static and dynamic dependency of <b>the</b> coefficient functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> variables. <b>The</b> properties and performance of the proposed method are evaluated using illustrative examples...|$|R
