5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play <b>ourselves,</b> {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of <b>ourselves.</b> We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really flattered.|$|E
5|$|Bieber {{performed}} the song several times including {{at the new}} Microsoft Store grand opening in Mission Viejo, California, and in a live session with MTV. He also later performed it on The Early Show {{as a part of}} their 2010 Super Bowl programming, and on BET's SOS: Saving <b>Ourselves</b> - Help for Haiti Telethon, to benefit Haiti after the earthquake, performing live on February 6, 2009, which also aired on VH1, and MTV.|$|E
5|$|I believe that, {{beyond a}} doubt, {{we are now}} facing the best {{opportunity}} we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement {{to be the most}} important final goal to which we must devote <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{he became}} a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their {{sponsors}} and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be <b>ourselves</b> and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion {{to take the first}} steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.|$|E
5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside <b>ourselves</b> on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|On {{reaching}} Berneray {{we landed}} {{and soon after}} betook <b>ourselves</b> to a hut which we found cleared for our reception. We dined on roasted mutton, wild fowls' eggs, bread, butter and whisky. The goodman of the house came home with a basketful of eggs from the rocks, and some birds he had caught.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save <b>ourselves</b> by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record <b>ourselves.</b> So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit <b>ourselves,</b> it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

25|$|We made a {{personal}} inventory and accepted <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider <b>ourselves.</b> We can view <b>ourselves</b> as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view <b>ourselves</b> as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view <b>ourselves</b> when we think of <b>ourselves</b> as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
25|$|And {{we found}} <b>ourselves</b> alone in this.|$|E
25|$|We {{especially}} remember information if we relate it to <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E

25|$|We {{classify}} {{other animals}} and living beings as nature, {{acting as if}} we <b>ourselves</b> {{are not part of}} it. Then we pose the question ‘How should we deal with Nature?’ We should deal with nature the way we should deal with <b>ourselves!</b> We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} develops {{the idea that}} the organization of society is made and can be remade—we can rebel against the worlds we have built; we can interrupt our rebellions and establish <b>ourselves</b> in any of those worlds. By emphasizing the disembodiment of institutional and social structures, the theory provides a basis to explain <b>ourselves</b> and our world without using necessitarian thought or predetermined institutional arrangements.|$|E
25|$|All this we owe both to <b>ourselves</b> and to {{the peoples}} of the world who are so well {{represented}} here today.|$|E
25|$|Help {{us to be}} unselfish in friendship, {{thoughtful}} {{of those}} less happy than <b>ourselves,</b> and eager to bear the burdens of others.|$|E
