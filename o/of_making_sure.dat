5|$|The {{pastor of}} Mt. St. Peter Parish is {{appointed}} to the position by the Bishop and {{is the leader of}} the parish. When one steps down, is transferred to another church, passes away, or retires, another is appointed. He is in charge <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that everything goes smoothly with the priests and administration of the church. The pastor works in collaboration with the Parish Staff, the Parish Pastoral Council, and the Parish Finance Council. His mission is to proclaim and help facilitate the building of the Kingdom of God among the parishioners of Mt. St. Peter Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
25|$|Hart and Mould {{were the}} band's songwriters. Both wrote their songs {{separately}} {{and at a}} prodigious pace; in later years, Hart accused Mould <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> his songs comprised no more than 45 percent of the material on an album. They designed their logo to represent their common train of thought, a circle enclosing three parallel horizontal lines with a vertical line connecting them. The circle symbolized the band: the three lines were the individual members, and the intersecting line was the common thread of creativity which connected them.|$|E

25|$|If {{the rate}} of {{absorption}} (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate {{at the edges of}} a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.|$|E

The director also is in charge <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices is manned with qualified agents. Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI. Since then, the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.|$|E
25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be done properly by an experienced teacher who spends many years passing on the teachings to the student in person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> the secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E

25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator {{tells the}} reader {{that he was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> the crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the merger}} of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance to create the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, the provincial Progressive Conservatives have not been {{formally}} affiliated with {{a party at the}} federal level. Under Premier Williams the party's relationship with federal Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, was often tenuous. After Harper reneged on a promise made to Williams during the 2006 federal election, regarding equalization payments, Williams launched the Anything But Conservative (ABC) campaign. The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives, with a goal <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> no Conservative was elected in the next federal election in Newfoundland and Labrador. The campaign, which was supported by all but one member of Williams' caucus, crippled the federal party's ability to find candidates and volunteers. On election night the campaign was successful, the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election, and won only 17 {{percent of the popular vote}} in the province. Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government. Following the election Williams announced that it was time to end his battle with Ottawa, and both he and Harper signalled a willingness to work with each other.|$|E

He was in charge of collecting all of the pledges made [...] toward the Building Fund. This work kept him in the bank for one or two hours longer than the other employees every evening. This went on for almost five years. [...] Mr. Shiarella was also in charge <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> there was enough money in the church's bank account for the payroll that was taken out every other Friday.

Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we {{wanted to do was to}} make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight.

500|$|That said, however, additionally, the French lacked neither {{relatively}} mobile tanks nor relatively offensively-intended tanks, in {{the local}} area of battle just as well so, for the most part, as in the whole broad Western European theatre of war and campaign of military operations of the time. French military doctrine dictated that the tanks, mostly FCM 36s, predominantly and primarily designed and intended as basically defensive-oriented infantry-support units, were to advance with the infantry. The speed of the FCM 36 was not designed to go any faster for this reason, so its top speed was only 24km/h (15mph). It took from 07:30 to 08:45 on 14 May for the French armour to traverse the last [...] to the ridge.

Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth Iron Man." [...] Despite this, in April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth Iron Man film, saying [...] "I feel like I could do one more." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{explosion}} {{was investigated}} separately by Apache Energy, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) and other agencies. The WA State Opposition {{called for a}} Royal Commission, with Energy Spokesperson John Day saying, [...] "It's a matter <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that this major disaster, which is now facing WA, does not happen again". Western Australian Premier Alan Carpenter said this was unnecessary because the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority was investigating and it could compromise their inquiry. Carpenter said their investigation will take 10–12 weeks to complete and its findings will be released to the public. State Opposition Leader, Troy Buswell, said that NOPSA had {{a conflict of interest}} as it helped perform safety inspections on the island, and therefore [...] "are conducting an investigation which will in part be an investigation into themselves".|$|E

Lennertz' score for the short is [...] "rock-based", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, [...] "We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a Jack White kind of a thing on guitar". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to Ennio Morricone with vocals in a [...] "classic spoofy" [...] way.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} factor in creating admissible entomological evidence is creating a clear and consistent chain of custody. [...] This means that any samples taken from a body or {{the scene of the}} crime in question must have been labeled correctly and the identity of those persons who had access to it must be recorded. [...] This record should show the location and custody of the samples at all times – from collection to analysis. [...] Typically, an entomologist on the scene will collect their samples and lock them in their scene kit as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that no one else has access to them to tamper with the evidence, ensuring that the information gathered in the field is viable in court. [...] If an accurate record of custody is not kept, then the presentation of this evidence could provide a reason for appeal.|$|E

While some of Bruner's posts were later deleted, TFN and journalists of numerous Texas and national publications made screen shots of the posts and began reporting on them, questioning her fitness to hold public office. When asked about her public statements, Bruner defended them, saying [...] "I don't intend to apologize for my opinions because I still believe my statements were accurate." [...] After Bruner's defeat, TPN president Kathy Miller issued a statement saying: [...] "Texas escaped an education train wreck tonight.
