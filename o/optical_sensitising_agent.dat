40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy characterised {{by increased}} resistance to insulin. Metformin {{is one of}} the longest established oral insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents.</b> For decades its use was restricted to management of type 2 diabetes. However, in the past two decades, its properties as an insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> have been explored in relation to its applicability for women with PCOS. Metformin is an effective ovulation induction agent for non-obese women with PCOS and offers some advantages over other first line treatments for anovulatory infertility such as clomiphene. For clomiphene-resistant women, metformin alone or in combination with clomiphene is an effective next step. Women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilisation should be offered metformin to reduce their risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Limited evidence suggests that metformin may be a suitable alternative to the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for treating hyperandrogenic symptoms of PCOS including hirsutism and acne. More research is required to define whether metformin has a role in improving long term health outcomes for women with PCOS, including the prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer.

40|$|TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) {{belongs to}} the TNF {{cytokine}} family and can signal to apoptosis by binding to either of two membrane-bound death receptors, TRAIL-R 1 or TRAIL-R 2. Using ligands specific for TRAIL-R 1 (R 1 L) or TRAIL-R 2 (R 2 L), our laboratory has previously shown that combining a histone deacetylase inhibitor with R 1 L, but not R 2 L, induces apoptosis in primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells. The aim of this project was to extend the profiling of TRAIL-Receptor signalling to breast cancer, using breast cancer cell lines and importantly primary breast tumours as model systems. A 3 -dimensional explant culturing technique was employed to maintain the primary tumour architecture and mimic the breast tumour microenvironment. In addition, tumour-initiating cells from advanced metastatic breast cancer patients were also tested for their sensitivity to TRAIL. The results obtained from breast cancer cell lines, primary mucinous carcinomas and advanced metastatic breast cancer cells suggest that in breast cancer, TRAIL-R 1 is the predominant functional TRAIL death receptor independent of oestrogen receptor status. In contrast, invasive ductal/lobular carcinomas (IDC/ILC) were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and required the breast cancer chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin as a <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent.</b> Studies using the TRAIL-resistant cell line, T 47 D, demonstrated that doxorubicin sensitised tumour cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via enhanced TRAIL DISC formation. Importantly, in primary tumour explants, the combination of doxorubicin and TRAIL signalled to apoptosis exclusively in the tumour cells, but not in normal cells. Significantly, in four IDC/ILC tumours, doxorubicin sensitised breast tumour cells to R 1 L more efficiently than R 2 L. Therefore, using R 1 L in combination with sub-lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents could improve the benefit of conventional therapy whilst reducing drug-associated side-effects and potential TRAIL-mediated cell proliferation/survival in apoptosis-resistant tumour cells. My data suggest that using a TRAIL-R 1 -selective agonist with an appropriate <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> (example, doxorubicin), offers a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of breast cancer.

40|$|Numerous studies {{demonstrate}} that the chemopreventive effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on colon cancer is mediated through inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. For these effects non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been recently employed as <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> in chemotherapy. We have shown previously that treatments with aspirin and NS- 398, a cyclo-oxygenase- 2 selective inhibitor, affect proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the human colon adenocarcinoma Caco- 2 cells. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of aspirin and NS- 398 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on sensitivity of Caco- 2 cells to irinotecan (CPT 11) and etoposide (Vp- 16) topoisomerase poisons. We find that aspirin co-treatment is able to prevent anticancer drug-induced toxicity, whereas NS- 398 co-treatment poorly affects anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. These effects correlate with the different ability of aspirin and NS- 398 to interfere with cell cycle during anticancer drug co-treatment. Furthermore, aspirin treatment is associated {{with an increase in}} bcl- 2 expression, which persists {{in the presence of the}} anticancer drugs.

40|$|Occupational lung {{diseases}} {{are an important}} public health issue and are avoidable through preventive interventions in the workplace. Up-to-date knowledge about changes in exposure to occupational hazards {{as a result of}} technological and industrial developments is essential to the design and implementation of efficient and effective workplace preventive measures. New occupational agents with unknown respiratory health effects are constantly introduced to the market and require periodic health surveillance among exposed workers to detect early signs of adverse respiratory effects. In addition, the ageing workforce, many of whom have pre-existing respiratory conditions, poses new challenges in terms of the diagnosis and management of occupational lung diseases. Primary preventive interventions aimed to reduce exposure levels in the workplace remain pivotal for elimination of the occupational lung disease burden. To achieve this goal there is still a clear need for setting standard occupational exposure limits based on transparent evidence-based methodology, in particular for carcinogens and <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> that expose large working populations to risk.

40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} endocrine condition with reproductive and metabolic implications. In the current setting there is an evolving, yet inadequate, understanding of the pathophysiology, long-term health implications and ideal therapies for women with PCOS. Insulin resistance, secondary to both genetic and lifestyle factors, is integrally involved in the pathogenesis, the metabolic and clinical features and the long-term sequelae of PCOS in a majority of patients. Therapeutic strategies targeting insulin resistance ameliorate clinical features and may reduce long-term sequelae of PCOS, including diabetes. The main benefit of improved insulin resistance is to improve fertility and potentially to improve clinical features of hyperandrogenism and lower androgen levels. Insulin sensitisers also {{have the potential to}} delay the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in PCOS. Lifestyle therapy is indicated as the first intervention; however, metformin as an insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> has a role in first-line medical therapy in women with PCOS.

METHODS [...] Interviews, examinations, and patch tests of the hairdressers from nine hairdressing stores randomly selected from Tainan City. Patch test agents included 41 substances with common allergens, shampoo preservatives, hair dyes, permanent waving and bleaching agents. RESULTS [...] 98 hairdressers finished the examination, 83 % of them had occupational dermatosis and 32 % had scissor induced scars or wounds. Most of the dermatoses belonged to either dry metacarpophalangeal dermatitis or eczema of the fingers. 44 % of the hairdressers showed positive skin reaction {{to one or more}} patch test agents. The patch test results were different from previous reports in that the most common allergens were nickel, thimerosal, Captan, Kathon CG, and fragrance mix, and that the sensitivity to hair dye and permanent wave ingredients were low. The dry metacarpophalangeal dermatitis was associated with exposure to shampoo, and the eczema of the fingers with skin sensitivity to patch test agents.

40|$|Reduction of {{exposure}} to <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> causing occupational asthma has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} total avoidance in order to minimise the adverse socio-economic impact of the condition. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of these two management options on asthma and socio-economic outcomes. A bibliographic search was conducted to identify studies examining the outcome of workers with occupational asthma after reduction or cessation {{of exposure}} to the causal agent. The changes in asthma symptoms and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness after reduction or cessation of exposure were described in nine and five studies, respectively. The meta-analysis of pooled data showed that a reduction of exposure was associated with a lower likelihood of improvement (OR 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 03 - 0. 91) and recovery (OR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 84) of asthma symptoms and a higher risk of worsening of the symptoms (OR 10. 23, 95 % CI 2. 97 - 35. 28) and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (OR 5. 65, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 28. 82), compared with complete avoidance of exposure.

40|$|Purpose: This {{case-control study}} was {{undertaken}} to elucidate the controversy concerning whether low-level, long-term exposure to non-sensitising air pollution at workplaces may cause asthma. Methods: A case-control study of 192 adult-onset asthma cases aged 20 - 65 years and 323 controls {{was conducted in}} the southeast of Sweden. Cases were identified from computerised registers from the region, diagnosed 2000 - 2004 and diagnoses were confirmed via medical files. Referents were randomised from the population register of the region. Exposure was monitored by a 16 -page questionnaire. Special attention was devoted to identifying and in the final analyses excluding subjects exposed to <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents.</b> Results: Three years or more of occupational exposure to air pollution from dust, smoke, fumes or vapours before the year of diagnosis by analyses adjusting for age yielded an increased risk for asthma (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 4. 2) in men, while in women, no risk was seen. In a multiple logistic regression analysis in men without allergy in childhood, a significant risk was seen (OR = 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 7. 4), when subjects exposed to identified allergens were excluded. In women, no excess risk was observed from occupational air pollution. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} support an association between occupational exposure to low level non-sensitising air pollution and adult-onset asthma in men.

40|$|CONTEXT: due to {{the central}} role of {{metabolic}} abnormalities in the pathophysiology of PCOS, insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> have been proposed as a feasible treatment option. OBJECTIVE: to investigate which is the more effective between metformin and myoinositol on hormonal, clinical and metabolic parameters in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN: crossover randomized-controlled study. PATIENTS: Thirty-four PCOS obese women (age: 25. 62 ± 4. 7 years; BMI: 32. 55 ± 5. 67 kg/m 2) were randomized to receive metformin (850 mg twice a day) or myoinositol (1000 mg twice a day) for six months. After a three month washout, the same subjects received the other compound for the following six months. MEASUREMENTS: Ultrasonographic pelvic examinations, hirsutism score, anthropometric and menstrual pattern evaluation, hormonal profile assays, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and lipid profile at baseline and after 6 months of treatment were performed. RESULTS: Both metformin and myoinositol significantly reduced the insulin response to OGTT and improved insulin sensitivity. Metformin significantly decreased body weight, and improved menstrual pattern and Ferriman-Gallwey score. Metformin treatment was also associated with a significant decrease in LH and estradiol levels, androgens and AMH levels. None of these clinical and hormonal changes were observed during myoinositol administration. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments improved the glyco-insulinaemic features of obese PCOS patients,but only metformin seems to exert a beneficial effect on the endocrine and clinical features of the syndrome.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Soluble {{platinum}} salts {{are well}} known respiratory <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> leading to work related sensitisation in the work environment. No quantitative exposure response relation has been described for soluble platinum salts. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore exposure response relations for soluble platinum salt exposed workers. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected health surveillance data and soluble platinum exposure data. Workers who newly entered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2010 were included and the relation between measured soluble platinum exposure and sensitisation (as determined by skin prick testing) was analysed in more than 1000 refinery workers from 5 refineries from whom a total of more than 1700 personal exposure measurements were available. Exposure response relations were analysed in survival analysis considering changes in exposure over time. Associations were explored for present exposure, cumulative exposure and average exposure. The exposure was lagged by 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, etc. year with a maximum of 5 years. RESULTS: A clear exposure response relation was observed, most strongly for present platinum salt exposure. Exposure lagging showed that exposure preceding sensitisation with maximally 1 - 2 years was most strongly associated with sensitisation risk. The exposure response relationship was modified by smoking and atopy, but relative risks for smoking and atopy were only modestly elevated. CONCLUSIONS: The precision of estimate of the exposure-response relationship derived from this dataset appears superior to previous epidemiologic studies conducted on platinum salt sensitisation and may as a result have possible utility to occupational exposure standard setting...|$|R

In analytical chemistry, laser induced fluorescence was used to image the separation of substances during capillary electrophoresis. Here, an optical fibre imaging technique facilitated a higher sensitivity compared with a lens imaging technique. The motion of the substances was also monitored. In a similar experiment, laser induced fluorescence was used to image substances that do not exhibit fluorescence. Levitated drops have also been used as a wall-free cuvette during the study of fat-cell behaviour and protein precipitation, where laser induced fluorescence detection was used in the first part and light scattering detection in the second part. For environmental monitoring a lidar (light detection and ranging) system was used. Here, measurements have been performed at different monumental buildings to detect both biodeteriogen invasion and protective treatment. The system was also moved onto a ship for experiments in the Mediterranean Sea. Laser induced fluorescence was here used for monitoring of chlorophyll contents in the seawater together with distributed organic matter (DOM). With the use of depth resolved measurements, the water absorption was studied.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of {{mortality}} in Type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). Vascular dysfunction is an early and critical event in the development of cardiovascular disease. Children with T 1 D have vascular dysfunction therefore early interventions to improve vascular health are essential to reduce cardiovascular mortality in T 1 D. Metformin is an insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> which is known to improve vascular health outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and other individuals with insulin resistance. It has been used safely in children and adolescents with T 2 D for over 10 years. This study aims to assess the effect of metformin on vascular health in children with T 1 D. Methods/Design: This study is a 12 month, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial to determine the effect of metformin on vascular health in children (age 8 – 18) with T 1 D. The sample size is 76 with 38 children in the metformin group and 38 children in the placebo group. Vascular health and biochemical markers will be measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Vascular function will be measured using flow mediated dilatation and glyceryl trinitrate mediated dilatation of the brachial artery and vascular structure will be measured with carotid and aortic intima media thickness, using standardised protocols. Discussion: This study will be the first to investigate the effect of metformin on vascular health in children with T 1 D.

40|$|AIM: As many {{overweight}} {{people with}} T 1 DM are insulin resistant, adjuvant therapy with insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents,</b> such as metformin, may be beneficial. This study evaluated {{the effect of}} adjuvant metformin in T 1 DM on insulin sensitivity, diabetic control, body composition, quality of life (QOL) and treatment satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3 -month prospective open-labelled pilot study of 16 patients aged 18 - 40 with T 1 DM and body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m(2) was performed. The patients received 500 - 850 mg metformin twice daily. Insulin sensitivity, assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test [n= 5], body composition, HbA(1 c) {{and quality of life}} (QOL) were measured before and after treatment. A retrospective review of 30 patients with T 1 DM treated with metformin for at least 4 months was also performed. BMI, HbA(1 c) and insulin requirements during metformin treatment was compared to pre-metformin data, and to patients treated with insulin only. RESULTS: In the pilot study, insulin sensitivity increased significantly from 0. 86 +/- 0. 33 x 10 (- 4) /min/(microU/ml) to 1. 17 +/- 0. 48 x 10 (- 4) /min/(microU/ml) after 3 months adjuvant therapy (p = 0. 043). This was associated with a decreased insulin requirement and mean daily blood glucose. There were no significant changes in HbA(1 c) or body composition. QOL significantly improved (p < 0. 002). The retrospective review revealed an initial reduction in HbA(1 c) (0. 8 +/- 1. 4 %, p = 0. 001). This effect diminished with prolonged treatment. BMI decreased in patients remaining on metformin for a 2 -year period (0. 5 +/- 0. 5 kg/m(2), p = 0. 042).

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{how and why}} TRPV 1 function is being modulated in sensory neuropathy and explored the potential of its rescue in the urinary bladder of STZ-?????induced diabetic rats. Diabetes induced a rapid decline in TRPV 1 function and changes in neurogenically mediated electrically-?????evoked responses together with a gradual decline in muscarinic function. Diabetic bladder was also deficient in muscarinic and TRPV 1 organ bath temperature-?????induced changes but not in those affecting spontaneous contractile activity. Exposure to a potential neuropathy causative agent, methylglyoxal was studied and its mechanism of action explored {{through the use of}} TRPA 1 ligands. Methylglyoxal exposure mimicked some of the effects of diabetes on TRPV 1, neurogenic electrically evoked responses and muscarinic function. Methylglyoxal effects were seen to be partly through TRPA 1 receptor activation but other as yet undefined pathways were also involved. Use of TRPA 1 ligands revealed an unexpected complexity of the interaction of the TRPA 1 receptor with TRPV 1. Finally the potential of reversing the diminished TRPV 1 response was examined through the use of three known <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents,</b> bradykinin, NGF and insulin. Bradykinin was the only agent seen to reverse the TRPV 1 diminished response back up to to control equivalent levels and through the use of bradykinin selective ligands, it was seen that the dual activation of BK-????? 1 and BK-????? 2 receptor was necessary to rescue the TRPV 1 response. The likely mechanism of action of bradykinin was through prostaglandin production as indomethacin blocked TRPV 1 rescue. In the acute stage of diabetes, TRPV 1 function is downregulated and may be caused by exposure to a neuropathy-?????causing metabolite such as methylglyoxal. The TRPV 1 function still retains plasticity at this acute stage because function could be enhanced back to control levels by bradykinin receptor activation : a potential for early therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of {{endotoxin}} as a <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> prior to neonatal hypoxiaischemia differing doses of endotoxin (E. coli lipopolysaccharide, LPS) were given to neonatal mice prior to hypoxia-ischemia, with sensitising effects noted at dosages of 0. 3 mg/kg of LPS or higher. Varying the time interval between endotoxin administration and hypoxia-ischemia demonstrated that LPS given between 4 and 12 hours before hypoxia-ischemia had a sensitising effect on subsequent hypoxia ischemia. In contrast, LPS given {{at the time of}} or 24 hours before hypoxia-ischemia did not. To help understand the mechanism by which this sensitising effect occurs, a dose-response study of LPS alone was undertaken. Here, a dose-dependent activation of microglia was demonstrated throughout the brain, particularly in the thalamus and cortex, by 12 hours following endotoxin administration. There was also evidence of vascular endothelial activation (ICAM 1) as early as 4 hours after endotoxin administration. To study the role of the TNF cluster of cytokines (TNF alpha, lymphotoxin alpha and lymphotoxin beta), animals with a deletion of the entire TNF cluster were examined. Deletion of the TNF cluster was shown to abolish both endotoxin-mediated sensitisation of the developing brain to subsequent hypoxia, and to prevent upregulation of macrophage and vascular endothelium by endotoxin alone. This study also examined the effects of hypoxia-ischemia on intracellular pH. Increasing duration of hypoxia-ischemia resulted in a progressive intracellular acidosis within the brain, initially ipsilateral to the carotid ligation, but becoming bilateral with prolonged hypoxia. In the reoxygenation phase, there was a rebound intracellular alkalosis at 6 hours of reoxygenation across the whole forebrain. Previous studies have suggested that this alkalosis is mediated by a Na+/H+ exchanger. Blockade of this transporter with N-methyl isobutyl amiloride prior to hypoxia-ischemia was shown to confer neuroprotection in the developing brain. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} implementing a physician based surveillance system of occupational respiratory diseases (PROPULSE) in Québec with regard to physician participation rate, characteristics of reported cases, and comparison with official statistics from the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB). METHODS: All chest physicians and allergists in Québec were asked to report suspected new cases of occupational respiratory diseases, on a monthly basis, between October 1992 and September 1993. For each case, personal information was collected and the physician's opinion on whether the condition was related to work was categorised as highly likely, likely, and unlikely. RESULTS: Of the 161 physicians initially approached, 68 % participated. Physicians rated 48 % of suspected cases as highly likely, 29 % as likely, and 20 % as unlikely. The most often reported diagnosis was asthma (63 %), followed by diseases related to asbestos (16 %). Silicosis was less frequent (5 %) but it was reported for six workers under 40 of whom five were involved in sandblasting activities. The high proportion of cases of asthma probably reflects the increasing importance of this disease but may also reflect the different patterns of reporting among physicians with different expertise. The distribution of cases by diagnostic category is quite different between the PROPULSE system {{and that of the}} WCB (annual mean number of compensated cases during a four year period). Asthma and allergic alveolitis are more frequent in PROPULSE, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome are about the same in both systems, and other diseases are more frequent among compensated cases. The most frequent <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> reported for asthma were the same in both systems (isocyanates, flour, and wood dust). 15 % of the PROPULSE cases were not covered by the WCB, and therefore would not be found in the board's official statistics.

One subject, although exposed for 11 years without symptoms, developed asthma after a single severe exposure during a ventilation failure. This was the only subject who had never smoked. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific bronchial challenges. Two workers had isolated immediate reactions, one a late asthmatic reaction, and four a dual response following exposure to nebulised potassium dichromate at 1 - 10 mg/ml. Two of the four subjects were also challenged with nebulised nickel chloride at 0. 1 - 10 mg/ml. Two showed isolated late asthmatic reactions, in one at 0. 1 mg/ml, where nickel was probably the primary <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent.</b> Four workers carried out two hourly measurements of peak expiratory flow over days at and away from work. All were scored as having occupational asthma using OASYS- 2. Breathing zone air monitoring was carried out in 60 workers from four decorative and two hard chrome plating shops from workers with similar jobs to those sensitised. No measurement exceeded the current occupational exposure standard for chromate or nickel, the mean levels of chromate exposure for jobs {{similar to those of the}} affected workers were 9 - 15 micrograms/m 3. CONCLUSION: Chrome used in electroplating is a potential cause of occupational asthma. Sensitivity to chrome in electroplaters may occur in situations where exposure levels are likely to be within the current exposure standards. There may be cross reactivity with nickel. Inhalation challenge with nebulised potassium dichromate solution is helpful in making the specific diagnosis where doubt exists. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{group of}} <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> are so called {{high molecular weight}} sensitisers [...] proteins or glycoproteins with molecular weights in the 5 - 70 kDa range that can provoke a specific IgE response in workers exposed to these agents. Exposure to high molecular weight sensitisers could only be evaluated indirectly in the recent past. Few measurement techniques existed {{that made it possible}} to measure the allergens directly. As a result, few studies focused on establishing exposure- response relations, and exposure standards have not been established for high molecular weight sensitisers, or those that have are of doubtful scientific basis. Recent use of immunoassays changed this perspective dramatically. Antibodies used in the assays can originate from human serum (sensitized workers), serum from sensitised animals (rabbits producing polyclonal antibodies), or animal derived cell cultures producing monoclonal antibodies. Although few comparative studies exist, the available evidence suggests that although the correlation of allergen concentrations obtained with different assays is good, large systematic differences occur. The use of conversion factors to make data from previously performed allergen measurements comparable or exchangeable is limited and thorough standardization of assays is preferred. Validation and comparison of different assays by comparisons between laboratories seem important issues that have not received the attention needed. Epidemiological studies in several industries that used immunoassay for the exposure characterisation have shown that risk of sensitisation increases with increasing exposure to allergens. Several studies have also shown that clear differences in potency seem to exist. Sensitisation to rat urinary allergens and fungal alpha-amylase occurred in the pg/m 3 and ng/m 3 range. The main research questions of the near future have to focus on the prevention of occupational sensitisation. Standard setting seems possible for some allergenson the basis of the available scientific evidence for the existence of exposure response relations. However, assays for characterising exposure to allergens have to be rigorously standardised before they can be used under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PSC) is {{a chronic}} liver disease with an autoimmune aetiology, {{which leads to}} the destruction of biliary epithelial cells causing fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. Major autoimmune responses seen in PSC patients are directed against lipoylated members of the 2 -oxo-acid dehydrogenase family of multi-enzyme complexes with lipoic acid (LA) itself forming a direct part of key autoepitopes. It has been hypothesised that small changes in a self-antigen, such as the aberrant binding ofaxenobiotic, could render a self-antigen immunogenic and potentially lead to autoimmunity. Xenobiotics synthetically bound to a Iipoyl domain peptide in the place of LA have previously been found to react very strongly with PSC patient antibodies. When used as a <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent</b> in animal models one of these compounds has been. shown to induce PSC like immune responses, however the ability of these substances to be produced in vivo has not been demonstrated. The exogenous Iipoylation pathway consists of two enzymes; Iipoate activating enzyme (LAE), a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (MACS 1) highly expressed in liver tissue, which converts LA to Iipoyl-AMP and Iipoyl transferase (LT) which catalyses the transfer of Iipoyl-AMP to Iipoyl-domains. Importantly, some evidence suggests that these enzymes are capable of substrate promiscuity. This work details the development of a novel, recombinant exogenous Iipoylation system. Recombinant LT and LAE were shown capable of Iipoylating the relevant domains {{in the same way as}} the in vivo system. The fidelity of the system was tested.. using a number of potential xenobiotics, several of which were found to be incorporated into Iipoyl domains in the place of LA. These additions were validated by mass spectrometry. Further investigations with one such xenobiotic, 6 -bromohexanoic acid, showed that it could not only compete with LA, but also identified conditions in which it was preferentially incorporated. Xenobiotic incorporation was demonstrated in both the inner Iipoyl domain of the E 2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the major autoantigen of PSC, and in all Iipoyl domain containing subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxo-glutarate dehydrogenase complexes. The data presented demonstrate infidelity in the exogenous Iipoylation system, and reveals conditions in which certain xenobiotics may be incorporated into Iipoyl domains in preference to LA. This is an important proof of concept observation as it validates a potential mechanism for the development of altered-self auto-immunogenicity.

40|$|Background: B-cell {{precursor}} {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL) is {{the most}} common paediatric malignancy. Proto-oncogene MYC functions as a DNA binding transcriptional activator. BET family proteins facilitate MYC transcription, and have recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target in heamopoitic malignancies. JQl is a cell-permeable small molecule that binds competitively to the acetyl-lysine recognition motifs with high specificity for the bromodomains of BET family members, preventing their ability to transcribe MYC. JQI inhibitor bas previously demonstrated drastic anti-tumour activity in Vitro and in pre­ clinical models of c-Myc dependent malignancies. Aim: To investigate the sensitivity of ALL cells to JQI-mediated BET inhibition, and whether JQ 1 is capable of <b>sensitising</b> cytotoxic <b>agent</b> Dexamethasone resistant ALL cells to Dexamethasone induced cell killing both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Cytotoxicity assays were used to investigate JQl-mediated Dexamethasone sensitisation in ALL cells in vitro. A Xenograft model was used to investigate this in NOG mice in vivo. Results: JQl-dexamethasone co-treatment resulted insignificantly increased cell killing in vitro and complete tumour suppression in vivo. Discussion: JQl is capable of sensitising Dexamethasone resistant ALL cells to Dexamethasone induced cell killing both in vitro and in vivo. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) {{measurement}} {{is usually}} the most appropriate {{first step in the}} confirmation of occupational asthma. Visual assessment of the plotted record is more sensitive and specific than statistical methods so far reported. The use of visual analysis is limited by lack of widespread expertise in the methods. A computer assisted diagnostic aid (OASYS- 2) has been developed which is based on a scoring system developed from visual analysis. This removes the requirement for an experienced interpreter and should lead to the more widespread use of the technique. METHODS: PEF records were collected from workers attending an occupational lung disease clinic for investigation of suspected occupational asthma and from workers participating in a study of respiratory symptoms in a postal sorting office. PEF records were divided into two development sets and two gold standard sets. The latter consisted of records from workers in which a final diagnosis had been reached by a method other than PEF recording. An experienced observer scored individual work and rest periods for the two development set PEF records; linear discriminant analysis was used to compare measurements taken from development set 1 records with visual scores. Two equations were produced which allowed prediction of scores for individual work or rest periods. The development set 2 was used to determine how these scores should be used to produce a whole record score. The first gold standard set was used to determine the whole record score which best separated those with and without occupational asthma. The second set determined the sensitivity and specificity of the chosen score. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty eight PEF records were collected from 169 workers and divided into two development sets (81 and 60 records) and two gold standard sets (60 and 67 records). Linear discriminant analysis produced equations predicting the score for work periods incorporating five indices of PEF change and one for rest periods using seven indices. These equations correctly predicted the score for development set 1 work and rest periods on 61 % of occasions (kappa = 0. 47). The whole record score for development set 2 records, after weighting for definite or definitely no occupational effect, correlated with the visual score (correlation coefficient 0. 86). Comparison with gold standard set 1 identified a cut off which proved to have a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 94 % for an independent diagnosis of occupational asthma when applied to gold standard set 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the sensitivity and specificity of analysing PEF records for occupational asthma using OASYS- 2 approaches that of visual analysis, but it should be absolutely reproducible. The performance of OASYS- 2 is more specific and approaches the sensitivity of other statistical methods of analysis. The evaluation {{of a large number of}} PEF records from workers exposed to different <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> suggests that these results should be robust and should be repeatable in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Background Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogaenemia and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinaemia {{is associated}} {{with an increase in}} cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes mellitus. If insulin <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> such as metformin are effective in treating features of PCOS, then they could have wider health benefits than just treating the symptoms of the syndrome. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of insulin sensitising drugs in improving reproductive outcomes and metabolic parameters for women with PCOS and menstrual disturbance. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, third Quarter 2008), CINAHL (searched September 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2008), and EMBASE (January 1985 to September 2008). All searches were rerun 13 August 2009 17 RCTs were located and await classification. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which investigated the effect of insulin sensitising drugs compared with either placebo or no treatment, or compared with an ovulation induction agent. Data collection and analysis Thirty one trials (2537 women) were included for analysis, 27 of them using metformin and involving 2150 women. Main results There is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone (Pooled OR = 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 16 to 6. 39) or in combination with clomiphene (Pooled OR = 1. 48, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 95). However, clinical pregnancy rates are improved for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR = OR 3. 86, 95 % C. I. 2. 18 to 6. 84) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR = 1. 48, 95 % C. I. 1. 12 to 1. 95)). In the studies that compared metformin and clomiphene alone, {{there was no evidence of}} an improved live birth rate (OR= 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 44 to 1. 02) but the pooled OR resulted in improved clinical pregnancy rate in in the clomiphene group (OR = 0. 63, 95 % 0. 43 to 0. 92), although there was significant heterogeneity. There is also evidence that ovulation rates are improved with metformin in women with PCOS for metformin versus placebo (Pooled OR 2. 12, 95 % CI 1. 50 to 3. 0) and for metformin and clomiphene versus clomiphene alone (Pooled OR = 3. 46, 95 % CI 1. 97 to 6. 07). Metformin was also associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions In agreement with the previous review, metformin is still of benefit in improving clinical pregnancy and ovulation rates. However, there is no evidence that metformin improves live birth rates whether it is used alone or in combination with clomiphene, or when compared with clomiphene. Therefore, the use of metformin in improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limitedThomas Tang, Jonathan M Lord, Robert J Norman, Ephia Yasmin and Adam H Bale...|$|R
40|$|Resistance to anticancer therapy {{represents}} a major barrier in the successful management of human breast cancer. The identification of novel biomarkers that correlate with treatment response would increase {{our understanding of}} the resistance mechanisms and may allow therapy to be tailored on an individual patient basis. Those patients unlikely to respond to a particular treatment strategy would be spared the serious life-threatening side effects for no therapeutic gain. The immediate implementation of a more appropriate treatment strategy may also prevent disease progression and such biomarkers would also suggest new drug targets and/or <b>sensitising</b> <b>agents</b> for future therapeutic intervention. The primary aim of this thesis was to establish and optimise two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and to exploit this global proteomics approach to identify molecular markers associated with resistance to anticancer therapy in human breast cancer cells. This technique was applied to compare the MCF 7 cell line with novel derivatives displaying significant resistance to cisplatin (MCF 7 CR) and radiotherapy (MCF 740 Gy). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Several molecular markers have been identified, which {{may play a role in}} resistance to anticancer therapy. Western blotting was used to confirm the expression of selected targets and to ensure the accuracy of protein identification. Examples of those targets which were confirmed by western blotting include GST-M 3, cytokeratin 17, peroxiredoxin 4 and HSP 27 (which were associated with cisplatin resistance) and L-Plastin, GST-M 3 and cytokeratin 17 (which were associated with radio-resistance). These provide interesting targets and are worthy of further studies. Although 2 DE-MALDI-TOF MS remains the gold standard for the global analysis of protein expression this technique is associated with several drawbacks. The antibody microarray is a powerful new technique designed to overcome many of these drawbacks and provides complementary information. Antibody microarrays were applied to identify further molecular markers associated with resistance to anticancer therapy in human breast cancer cells. The MDA-MB- 231 cell line and a novel derivative (MDAMB- 231 DR) displaying significant resistance to doxorubicin were analysed using Panorama Cell Signalling antibody microarrays (Sigma-Aldrich) comprised of 224 antibodies. Several proteins were associated with resistance to doxorubicin and some proteins were confirmed by western blotting. These targets included p-ERK, cyclin D 2 and cyclin B 1. The technique was subsequently extended using the Labvision Antibody Microarray Kit (Neomarkers) to analyse the MCF 7 parental cell line and the derivative (MCF 740 Gy) displaying significant resistance to radiotherapy. The Labvision antibody microarrays were comprised of 720 antibodies. Results indicated that this kit requires further optimisation and a preliminary analysis of the data revealed that further developmental and statistical work is required for interpretation of the results. This thesis has generated a list of potential candidate proteins, which may play a role in the development of resistance to anticancer therapy. Some of these targets overlap between different treatment modalities and have been confirmed by western blotting. Further work is now required in order to determine the functional relevance of these interesting targets. Ultimately, overcoming resistance to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy would represent a major advance in the effective management of breast cancer today.

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is the {{interaction}} of FMN with proteins. For one of the proteins studied, the enzyme luciferase from bacteria, further investigations were done {{on the process of}} light emission. In chapter 2 and 3 studies are reported on the binding of FMN with relatively simple proteins, the flavodoxins. Flavodoxins were chosen, because they are small proteins with a molecular weight not higher than 23 000. They contain only one equivalent of FMN and consist of only one polypeptide chain. No other prosthetic group is known for the flavodoxins. I n addition to this they can be obtained in high yields from bacterial cultures. These features make the flavodoxins excellent objects for studies on the binding of flavins to proteins. In chapter 2 studies on the binding of FMN by apoflavodoxin from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii are reported. Conclusions were drawn from the dependence on the pH and the NaCl concentration. The rate constant of dissociation depends on the pH, even when extrapolated to zero ionic strength. The titration curve of this rate constant can be explained, by the assumption of the involvment of two protonations, that act highly cooperatively. It should be realised that these protonations do not influence the rate constant of association. But once the complex is formed, the chance of falling apart, if these sites are protonated, is around 6 times higher than without these sites protonated. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} calculated rate constant of association, when extrapolated to zero ionic strength is independent on the pH. At increasing ionic strength this rate constant of association will change. Depending on the pH 1 value, this change is a decrease or an increase in value. At a pH of 3. 8 there is almost no change with increasing ionic strength, but above this pH value the rate constant increases, while below this value it decreases with increasing ionic strength. This explains why the combination of a high salt concentration and a low pH is a very effective way of removing the FMN from flavodoxins. This finding might possibly be extrapolated to other flavoproteins as well. By interpreting the results in terms of the Brönsted theory, a net positive charge between 11 and 12 is found on the apoenzyme at low pH. This finding is in agreement with the number of basic amino acid residues in the polypeptide chain. A series of flavin analogues were synthesised and the kinetic parameters of the interaction with Azotobacter vinelandii apoflavodoxin investigated, These studies are presented in chapter 3. Use was made of a fast kinetic method, the temperature jump relaxation technique. The resolution time of the instrument employed is 11 microseconds. All complexes studied revealed only one relaxation process, indicating that within the time limits studied (11 micro seconds - ca. 10 seconds), the association of the flavin and the apoenzyme is a one-step process. This finding is in contrast with an earlier publication by other authors, who detected two relaxation processes. It is shown that the earlier published traces are instrumental artifacts. In chapter 4 the interaction of FMN with an intermediate in the in vitro bacterial bioluminescence reaction is described. The so called "longlived lntermediate", which has been suggested to be an FMN flavoprotein, hao been separated into an apoprotein and free FMN. Because of the high quantum yields of light with :respect to FMN, measured upon reaction of the apoprotein with aldehyde, in vitro bacterial bioluminescence appears to be a sensitised reaction. At a first consideration only FMN could be a likely candidate as a <b>sensitising</b> <b>agent.</b> However, in chapter 5 it is shown that a novel protein, isolated from the bacteria itself will definitely sensitise the in vitro bacterial bioluminescence reaction. This novel protein (BFP) is efficiently fluorescent (quantum yield of fluorescence 0. 45) and has an emission maximum at 476 nm. As a result of these observations, it is called the blue fluoreseence protein. By diluting this protein to a concentration of around 1 μM, a spectral shift of the emission maximum is observed. Actually the fluorescence emission spectrum of the protein changes from a spectrum identical to the In vivo bacterial bioluminescence into an emission spectrum identical to the in vitro bacterial bioluminescence emission. Although this means that the emission of this protein could account for both the in vivo and the in vitro emission spectra, it should be mentioned that investigations learned that the chromophore of this protein is not a product of the in vitro reaction. This blue fluorescence protein is the only one of all the emitters proposed so far, that simulates the bluest of the bacterial emissions exactly. Furthermore, the addition of the blue fluorescence protein to the in vitro reaction affects the light emission kinetics it acts as a catalyst), increases the light yield and induces a shift to shorter wavelengths in the bioluminescence emission. Together with the fact that the protein is isolated from the bacteria themselves, these features are strong evidence that this protein is the in vivo emitter. In chapter 6 the purification procedure of the BFP is given in more detail. Furthermore it is shown that it can be isolated from at least two of the four common species of marine bioluminescent bacteria. This suggests that all the bacteria emit their light via the same kind of chemical mechanism. Although the proteins from these two species of bacteria appear to have similar molecular weights, they differ in that the protein from P. fischeri is more tightly associated with the luciferase during the purification procedure than the one from P. phosphoreum and also that its fluorescence excitation maximum is shifted about 10 nm to shorter wavelength. Further investigation should be done in order to learn what the chemical nature of the fluorophore is. ...|$|R

On this basis, therapeutic drugs targeting BCL- 2 and MCL- 1 might have enhanced activity if used in combination. We identified anti-leukaemic drugs sensitising to BCL- 2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL- 1 antagonism using {{the technique of}} dynamic BH 3 profiling, whereby cells were primed with drugs to discover whether this would elicit mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in response to BCL- 2 -targeting BAD-BH 3 peptide or MCL- 1 -targeting MS 1 -BH 3 peptide. We found that {{a broad range of}} anti-leukaemic agents-notably MCL- 1 inhibitors, DNA damaging agents and FLT 3 inhibitors-sensitise leukaemia cells to BAD-BH 3. We further analysed the BCL- 2 inhibitors ABT- 199 and JQ 1, the MCL- 1 inhibitors pladienolide B and torin 1, the FLT 3 inhibitor AC 220 and the DNA double-strand break inducer etoposide to correlate priming responses with co-operative induction of apoptosis. ABT- 199 in combination with pladienolide B, torin 1, etoposide or AC 220 strongly induced apoptosis within 4 hours, but the MCL- 1 inhibitors did not co-operate with etoposide or AC 220. In keeping with the long half-life of BCL- 2, the BET domain inhibitor JQ 1 was found to downregulate BCL- 2 and to prime cells to respond to MS 1 -BH 3 at 48, but not at 4 hours: prolonged priming with JQ 1 was then shown to induce rapid cytochrome C release when pladienolide B, torin 1, etoposide or AC 220 were added. In conclusion, dynamic BH 3 profiling is a useful mechanism-based tool for understanding and predicting co-operative lethality between drugs sensitising to BCL- 2 antagonism and drugs sensitising to MCL- 1 antagonism.
