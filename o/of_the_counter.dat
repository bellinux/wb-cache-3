Pash had served as the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, where he had investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Pash's command comprised his executive officer Captain Wayne B. Stanard, four Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) agents, four interpreters, and four scientists: Dr. James B. Fisk from the Bell Telephone Company, Dr. John R. Johnson from Cornell University, Commander Bruce Olds from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Major William Allis, originally from MIT although then serving on the War Department scientific staff.|$|E
5|$|The American {{rock band}} Rise Against has {{recorded}} 130 songs, which include 117 original songs and 13 covers. The band {{was formed in}} 1999, and signed a recording contract with the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords the following year. Under this label, they released The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003), which helped to establish an early fanbase. Afterwards, the band signed with Geffen Records, and made their major record label debut with Siren Song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Culture (2004), which was followed by The Sufferer & the Witness (2006). Both albums charted on the Billboard 200, with the latter peaking at number ten. Rise Against's popularity continued to grow when they switched labels once again to DGC and Interscope Records. Their next three albums—Appeal to Reason (2008), Endgame (2011), and The Black Market (2014)—charted highly worldwide. Rise Against's eighth album, Wolves, was released in 2017.|$|E

5|$|The band spent {{its first}} four years signed to the {{independent}} record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which they released two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003). Both the albums met with considerable underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Geffen. Their major label debut Siren Song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success, producing several successful singles. Their next two albums, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten and number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed three years later by Endgame (2011). All four albums released via Geffen were certified platinum in Canada, while three of these albums were certified gold in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected {{when there were}} equipment failures. While there were some problems {{believed to be the}} result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage. However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down. With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues. By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Musically, Siren Song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Culture {{is rooted}} in {{hardcore}} punk and melodic hardcore.

To promote the album, Rise Against toured throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Siren Song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Culture sold poorly {{for the first six}} months, but the band's incessant touring schedule eventually led to a gradual increase in sales.

40|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is <b>the</b> latest {{generation}} <b>of</b> solar neutrino experiments designed {{to investigate the}} Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP). Through detection of all flavors of neutrinos, SNO will be capable <b>of</b> testing <b>the</b> neutrino oscillation hypothesis {{as a solution to}} the SNP. This unique capability stems from the flavor independent νx (2 H, n νx) 1 H reaction (νx = νe or ν µ or ντ). Observation of this Neutral Current (NC) reaction is through detection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free neutron. One method of detection utilizes an array of 3 He-filled proportional counters, and is called the Neutral Current Detector array (NCD array). This thesis describes the preliminary testing and characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>counter</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> array during an underground storage period at the SNO site. These tests were performed to verify <b>the</b> operational characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> assess <b>the</b> long-term stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> and measure potential backgrounds to the NC measurement in SNO. In addition, a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underground thermal neutron flux was made. The measurements to characterize <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> and assess <b>the</b> background contamination levels required <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> data acquisition electronics and analysis routines...|$|R
