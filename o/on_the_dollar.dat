5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> {{and the design}} was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been {{produced}} by reduction from the plaster models, was accomplished by painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 {{in the presence of}} de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, {{as the rest of the}} design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> was not known for over 85years.|$|E

25|$|Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, {{but unlike}} the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> rather than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> {{and there was a}} slight {{difference}} between these two units. <b>The</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> was created in 1792 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish <b>dollars.</b> As such, <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> was worth slightly more than <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> and likewise, <b>the</b> Newfoundland <b>dollar,</b> until 1895, was worth slightly more than <b>the</b> Canadian colonial <b>dollar.</b>|$|R
