40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{selected}} issues in <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons. In particular, {{it focuses on}} sanctions applicable to legal persons under the act on criminal liability of legal persons. I selected this topic since I am interested in criminal law, especially in criminal liability of legal persons. I decided to focus on <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons, or more precisely on selected issues thereof, since {{there are many reasons}} why this topic is subject of passionate discussions about the act. Based on theoretical and practical findings, this thesis aims to analyze whether the current state of law in the area <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons in the act on criminal liability of legal persons is perfect and fully sufficient, or whether it requires amending. The preface introduces the topic <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> criminal persons and the structure and the main goals of this thesis. Subsequently, the thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with theoretical issues. It covers different approaches to <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons throughout Europe and key arguments both in favor and against the introduction of new regulation <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons in the Czech Republic. The second chapter covers basic provisions <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> <b>of</b> legal persons in the act on criminal liability of [...] ...|$|R

5|$|This is {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> and hectoring.

5|$|The first form <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{initiated}} by the US against Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and Bob Dole. The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo. The amendment officially came into legal effect from May 6, 1992; although it applied only to $5 million-worth of US foreign aid, it was reported as instrumental in denying SFR Yugoslavia its last application for IMF loans before its breakup and hyperinflation episode.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E

5|$|Within the government, Van der Byl {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that {{economic}} destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965.|$|E

40|$|Up until recently, most legal {{philosophers}} {{have argued}} that an action is a token <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> if, and only if, (i) its performance brings about unwelcome consequences to the targets, and (ii) it is performed {{as a response to}} the breach of a duty. In this paper I take issue with this account. I first add some qualifications to it in order to present it in its most plausible form. After doing this, I advance a series of hypothetical cases which suggests that this account fails. I then propose a new account <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning,</b> whereby an action is a token <b>of</b> <b>sanctioning</b> if, and only if, it is performed in an appropriate context and is apt for punishing wrongdoers...|$|R

40|$|This study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>sanctions</b> {{examines the}} contribution of the target country to sanction outcomes. The theoretical foundation of this research is predicated on the role that target country political attributes play in fashioning a response to the imposition <b>of</b> economic <b>sanctions.</b> Accordingly, these attributes are instrumental in creating the countermeasures that target countries employ in resisting sanction effects. Therefore, the success <b>of</b> <b>sanction</b> episodes is influenced by target country political characteristics. The developed hypotheses are tested in two ways. First, an aggregate analysis on one hundred fifteen cases is conducted. This is complimented by a series of in-depth case study analyses on select sanction episodes. Both results indicate that some political attributes of the target country {{play an important role in}} determining the disposition <b>of</b> <b>sanction</b> episodes...|$|R
