5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, <b>objectification</b> (especially sexual <b>objectification),</b> oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging <b>objectification</b> and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual <b>objectification</b> of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} fnd the social {{representations}} of justice to adolescents from different social context. Two hundred and forty {{male and female}} adolescents participated in this study. They were divided into four groups: I- adolescents from public schools, II- adolescents from private schools, III- adolescents who spend their time on the streets, and IV- adolescents who were in a resocialization institution. In individual interviews, these adolescents were asked what justice meant. A semantic analysis of the answers given by the adolescents was con-ducted. This allowed researchers to identify the anchorages and <b>objectifications</b> of justice. In the results, the anchorages {{for most of the}} <b>objectifications</b> were not identified, except for in group IV. All the anchorages were related to the justice system. The results verified that the <b>objectifications</b> of group I were more diverse than the other groups. Moreover, it was reported that groups III and IV objectified justice mainly as expiatory punishment and kinds of authorities...|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} sexual <b>objectification</b> and, in particular, the <b>objectification</b> of women, is an {{important}} idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism. Many feminists regard sexual <b>objectification</b> as deplorable and as playing {{an important role in}} gender inequality. However, some social commentators argue that some modern women objectify themselves as an expression of their empowerment.|$|E
25|$|Sexual <b>objectification</b> is {{the act of}} {{treating}} a person as a mere object of sexual desire. <b>Objectification</b> more broadly means treating a person as a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity. <b>Objectification</b> is most commonly examined {{at the level of}} a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{concerning}} sexual <b>objectification</b> became first problemized during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, {{it has been}} argued that the phenomenon of female sexual <b>objectification</b> has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased <b>objectification</b> of women as an opportunity to use the female body as a mode of power.|$|E
25|$|Head harnesses, {{like many}} other forms of bondage, also {{have the effect of}} {{creating}} a sense of <b>objectification</b> and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer's eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of <b>objectification</b> and erotic subjection.|$|E
25|$|Sexual <b>objectification</b> {{occurs when}} a person is {{identified}} by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body. The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society. Sexual <b>objectification</b> can occur as a social construct among individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Accounts. Accounts are {{the ways}} members signify, {{describe}} or explain {{the properties of}} a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal <b>objectifications.</b> They are always both indexical {{to the situation in}} which they occur below, and, simultaneously reflexive - they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs etc., or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{an intersection}} of materiality and language use. I argue that verbal practices, generally overlooked in material culture studies, {{are an integral}} dimension of consumption. Types of talk – both referential and indexical – can illustrate how people mediate relationships with objects, {{as well as with}} each other. Drawing on ethnographic research in Silicon Valley, California (1999 – 2001), I present examples from middle-class South Asian American communities. In these closely-knit social contexts, I examine how people discursively create <b>objectifications</b> through talk and consumption of visual media such as video and photographs. My examination of these language practices reveals that people not only form relationships with objects they own, but also with <b>objectifications</b> – verbal and visual repre-sentations – of objects they borrow, rent, or imagine. Social theorists have remarked on how people can use contests of status and display associated with consumption to ascend into higher social classes. I consider how youth and adults engage in language use and consumption to instead display identity and status within their own community.

40|$|Early {{cybernetics}} emphasized {{control and}} {{communication in the}} animal and the machine. Subsequent understandings of linguistic phenomena in the animal have shown them not to be reducible to purely mechanistic models. The linguistic complementarity, with its possibilities for transcendence, provides such an understanding, indicating relativistic approaches within modern systems theory. Comparisons are made with Bohr´s concept of complementarity for quantum physics, again an area where linguistic <b>objectifications</b> are developing. The linguistic complementarity is taken {{as a basis for}} a general concept of language, permitting particularizations like programming languages, formal languages, genetic languages, and natural communication languages...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I pursue {{arguments}} concerning {{the relation between}} economic and ethical value. I consider the relationship of activities to objects and (following Aristotle and Arendt) distinguish between the activities of action (doing) and production (making). Marx founded his theory of value on labor {{and the way it}} is congealed and occluded in commodities and most anthropology, whether Marxist or non-Marxist, has followed suit in the attention to objects (or <b>objectifications).</b> What are the consequences of adding the value of acts (especially performative acts) to the value of labor and what are the “objects ” into which acts congeal? What would be a ritual theory of value...|$|R

According to Burger, “ For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to <b>objectifications</b> in the arts... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respond” ...|$|R
2500|$|Some see Schopenhauer's {{account of}} the Will as closely {{resembling}} classic examples of Monism. [...] Schopenhauer also developed some ideas {{that can be found}} in the theory of evolution, before Darwin began to publish his work, for example the idea that all life strives to preserve itself and to engender new life, and that our mental faculties are merely tools to that end. However, he saw species as fixed. His respect for the rights of animals – including a vehement opposition to vivisection – has led many modern animal rights activists to find in him a precursor of their positions. He thought of animals and humans as both being <b>objectifications</b> of the same underlying Will.|$|R

25|$|<b>Objectification</b> theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of <b>objectification</b> to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that <b>objectification</b> theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of <b>objectification</b> theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E
30|$|We {{realized}} that these imaginary objects emerged into students’ interaction dynamics {{through the process}} of solving the control problem of keeping the screen green – the imaginary objects were goal-oriented sensorimotor <b>objectifications</b> of the interaction space. The objects emerged from empty space to help the students perform a challenging motor-control coordination. That is, instead of attending to two hands separately, students could attend to a single object and control it. We further {{realized that}} attending to these objects helped students learn the new mathematical ideas, because students referred to these objects in modeling and describing their sensorimotor schemes, first qualitatively and then, once we introduced mathematical tools onto the screen, also quantitatively. Borrowing from Hutto and Sánchez-García (2015), we called these imaginary objects attentional anchors (Abrahamson & Sánchez-García, 2016; Abrahamson et al., 2016).|$|R

25|$|Sexual <b>objectification</b> {{has been}} studied based on the {{proposition}} that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can {{take place in the}} media or through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual <b>objectification</b> and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{context of}} these studies enables us to track {{the emergence of a}} sensorimotor scheme as the integration of two components – a new gestalt in the environment (the “sensori-” component, e.g., a new attentional anchor) and a way of moving relative to this perceptual invariant (the “motor” component, e.g., a new bimanual motion coordination centered on the attentional anchor). In particular, attentional anchors, such as a linear interval between two points, are what we have come to call goal-oriented sensorimotor <b>objectifications.</b> Students construct attentional anchors as their spontaneous solution to motor-control interaction problems. These attentional anchors constitute new proto-mathematical objects amenable to reflecting, modeling, articulating, and expressing in formal symbolic notation. The studies also demonstrate that, whereas light-handed guidance is sufficient for the emergence of attentional anchors, mathematical re-description of these interaction solutions requires more heavy-handed intervention.|$|R
