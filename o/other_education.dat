25|$|The Florida statewide {{teachers}}' {{strike of}} 1968 was a strike {{action in the}} state of Florida in February and March 1968 by teachers and <b>other</b> <b>education</b> workers belonging to the Florida Education Association (FEA). The cause of the strike was under-funding of the state's educational system at a time when attendance was rising sharply, and low pay and benefits for teachers. The strike lasted from a few days in some school districts to three months in others. Although a special session of the Florida Legislature approved higher taxes to pay for more school funding, FEA members felt the funding hikes were not enough and voted to continue striking. No additional funding was forthcoming, however, and most local affiliates of the FEA settled their contracts and went back to work by March.|$|E
