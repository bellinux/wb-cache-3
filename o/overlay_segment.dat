40|$|SkipNet is a {{scalable}} {{overlay network}} that provides controlled data placement and routing locality guarantees by organizing data primarily by lexicographic ordering of string names. A key side-effect of the SkipNet design {{is that all}} nodes from an organization form {{one or a few}} contiguous <b>overlay</b> <b>segments.</b> When an entire organization disconnects {{from the rest of the}} system, repair of only a few pointers quickly enables efficient routing throughout the disconnected organization; full repair is done as a subsequent background task. These same operations can be later used to efficiently reconnect an organization's SkipNet back into the global one...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program package for parametric and nonparametric linear system identification of both static and dynamic biological data, written for an LSI- 11 minicomputer with 28 K of memory, is described. The program has 11 possible commands including an instructional help command. A user can perform nonparametric spectral analysis and estimation of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of univariate data and estimate nonparametrically {{the transfer function}} and possibly an associated noise series of bivariate data. In addition, the commands provide the user the means to derive a parametric autoregressive moving average model for univariate data, to derive a parametric transfer function and noise model for bivariate data, and to perform several model evaluation tests such as pole-zero cancellation, examination of residual whiteness and uncorrelatedness with the input.

40|$|Overlay {{networks}} stretch a Layer 2 {{network and}} increase mobility of virtual machines. VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible LAN) {{is one of}} Layer 2 overlay schemes over a Layer 3 network proposed in IETF and its definition covers 16 M <b>overlay</b> networks or <b>segments</b> which solves 4 K limitation of VLANs. However VXLAN uses IP multicast for the isolation of network traffic by tenant in the shared network infrastructure. IP multicast requires great amount of resources such as IP multicast table and CPU therefore the scalability is to be limited by handling of IP multicast. We propose to manage IP multicast in overlay networks using OpenFlow instead of using dynamic registration protocol such as IGMP. We describe our implementations of VXLAN controller, edge switch with VXLAN gateway and OpenFlow switch. Our method using OpenFlow eliminates periodical Join/Leave messages and achieves more than 4 k tenants in our Layer 2 network at server edges, which was not possible before...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Prostate {{cancer is}} a major health threat for men. For over five years, the U. S. National Cancer Institute has {{performed}} prostate biopsies with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided robotic sys-tem. Purpose: A retrospective evaluation methodology {{and analysis of the}} clinical accuracy of this system is reported. Methods: Using the pre and post-needle insertion image volumes, a registration algorithm that contains a two-step rigid registration followed by a deformable refinement was developed to capture prostate dislocation during the procedure. The method was validated by using three-dimensional contour <b>overlays</b> of the <b>segmented</b> prostates and the registrations were accurate up to 2 mm. Re-sults: It was found that tissue deformation was less of a factor than organ displacement. Out of the 82 biopsies from 21 patients, the mean target displacement, needle placement error, and clinical biopsy error was 5. 9 mm, 2. 3 mm, and 4 mm, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that motion compensation for organ displacement should be used to im-prove targeting accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the problem of {{providing}} lightweight support at selected intermediate overlay forwarding nodes to achieve increased error resilience on a single peer-based overlay path for point-to-point video streaming. We propose a novel "Overlay Multi-hop FEC " (OM-FEC) scheme that is flexible and considers the error characteristics of each overlay hop. We partition the end-to-end <b>overlay</b> path into <b>segments</b> and provide error resilience over those segments. Architecturally, this flexible design lies between the end-to-end and hop-by-hop paradigms, and we argue that it is well suited to peer-based overlay networks. We evaluate our work by both simulations and real-world implementation using a real video streaming application. These evaluations show that OM-FEC outperforms a pure end-to-end strategy by 10 - 15 dB in terms of video PSNR, and can be much more efficient than a heavyweight hop-by-hop resilience strategy.

40|$|The GMT is an {{aplanatic}} Gregorian telescope {{consisting of}} 7 {{primary and secondary}} mirror segments that must be phased to within {{a fraction of an}} imaging wavelength to allow the 25. 4 meter telescope to reach its diffraction limit. When operating in Laser Tomographic Adaptive Optics (LTAO) mode, on-axis guide stars will not be available for segment phasing. In this mode, the GMT's Acquisition, Guiding, and Wavefront Sensing system (AGWS) will deploy four pickoff probes to acquire natural guide stars in a 6 - 10 arcmin annular FOV for guiding, active optics, and segment phasing. The phasing sensor will be able to measure piston phase differences between the seven primary/secondary pairs of up to 50 microns with an accuracy of 50 nm using a J-band dispersed fringe sensor. To test the dispersed fringe sensor design and validate the performance models, SAO has built and commissioned a prototype phasing sensor on the Magellan Clay 6. 5 meter telescope. This prototype uses an aperture mask to <b>overlay</b> 6 GMT-sized <b>segment</b> gap patterns on the Magellan 6. 5 meter primary mirror reimaged pupil. The six diffraction patterns created by these subaperture pairs are then imaged with a lenslet array and dispersed with a grism. An on-board phase shifter has the ability to simulate an arbitrary phase shift within subaperture pairs. The prototype operates both on-axis and 6 arcmin off-axis either with AO correction from the Magellan adaptive secondary MagAO system on or off in order to replicate as closely as possible the conditions expected at the GMT...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} proposed {{electron transfer}} (ET) pathway in the heme enzyme cytochrome c peroxidase has been excised from the structure, leaving an open ligand-binding channel in its place. Earlier studies on cavity mutants of this enzyme have revealed structural plasticity {{in this region}} of the molecule. Analysis of these structures has allowed {{the design of a}} variant in which the specific section of protein backbone representing a previously proposed ET pathway is accurately extracted from the protein. A crystal structure verified the creation of an open channel that <b>overlays</b> the removed <b>segment,</b> extending {{from the surface of the}} protein to the heme at the core of the protein. A number of heterocyclic cations were found to bind to the proximal-channel mutant with affinities that can be rationalized based on the structures. It is proposed that small ligands bind more weakly to the proximal-channel mutant than to the W 191 G cavity due to an increased off rate of the open channel, whereas larger ligands are able to bind to the channel mutant without inducing large conformational changes. The structure of benzimidazole bound to the proximal-channel mutant shows that the ligand accurately overlays the position of the tryptophan radical center that was removed from the wild-type enzyme and displaces four of the eight ordered solvent molecules seen in the empty cavity. Ligand binding also caused a small rearrangement of the redesigned protein loop, perhaps as a result of improved electrostatic interactions with the ligand. The engineered channel offers the potential for introducing synthetic replacements for the removed structure, such as sensitizer-linked substrates. These installed "molecular wires" could be used to rapidly initiate reactions, trap reactive intermediates, or answer unresolved questions about ET pathways...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a video see-through head-mounted display (HMD) augmented reality (AR) system for imageguided neurosurgical planning and navigation. The surgeon wears a HMD that presents him with the augmented stereo view. The HMD is custom fitted with two miniature color video cameras that capture a stereo view of the real-world scene. We are concentrating specifically at this point on cranial neurosurgery, so the images will be of the patient's head. A third video camera, operating in the near infrared, is also attached to the HMD and is used for head tracking. The pose (i. e., position and orientation) of the HMD is used to determine where to <b>overlay</b> anatomic structures <b>segmented</b> from preoperative tomographic images (e. g., CT, MR) on the intraoperative video images. Two SGI 540 Visual Workstation computers process the three video streams and render the augmented stereo views for display on the HMD. The AR system operates in real time at 30 frames/sec with a temporal latency of about three frames (100 ms) and zero relative lag between the virtual objects and the real-world scene. For an initial evaluation of the system, we created AR images using a head phantom with actual internal anatomic structures (segmented from CT and MR scans of a patient) realistically positioned inside the phantom. When using shaded renderings, many users had difficulty appreciating overlaid brain structures as being inside the head. When using wire frames and texture-mapped dot patterns, most users correctly visualized brain anatomy as being internal and could generally appreciate spatial relationships among various objects. The 3 -D perception of these structures is based on both stereoscopic depth cues and kinetic depth cues, with the user looking at the head phantom from varying positions. T [...] ...|$|R
