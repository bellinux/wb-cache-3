While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|Research on {{the drug}} given to the trial {{participants}} reveals {{it to be a}} chiral chemical, with two enantiomer forms; one is the harmless and beneficial Proloft, the other is the dangerous hallucinogen which Black and the others ingested. Dr Miller tells Black that he had been working on drugs to cure his own visions, which he believes are similar to Black's. One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after he ran into the road amidst <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic,</b> almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic</b> at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E
5|$|With {{more and}} more people coming to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic</b> through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, because {{vehicles}} {{must be able}} {{to cross}} the pavement in six different ways, a SPUI generally has a very large area of uncontrolled pavement {{in the middle of the}} intersection. This can be unsafe particularly if drivers are unfamiliar with the interchange type. Drivers making a left turn may become confused as <b>oncoming</b> turning <b>traffic</b> passes them on the right-hand side (or left-hand side in countries that drive on the left).|$|R
50|$|Disadvantages to turn lanes include {{increased}} pavement area, with associated {{increases in}} construction and maintenance costs, {{as well as}} increased amounts of stormwater runoff. They also increase the distance over which pedestrians crossing the street are exposed to vehicle traffic. If a turn lane has a separate signal phase, it often increases the delay experienced by <b>oncoming</b> through <b>traffic.</b> Without a separate phase, left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the turn lane.|$|R

5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic.</b> The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch's right-front tire exploded, {{causing him}} to hit the wall between turns three and four, and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256. Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash. He was transported to the infield medical center for a {{mandatory}} check-up. Edwards remained in the lead for the lap-262 restart. Earnhardt spun his tires, forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt. Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon, who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall, which had no SAFER barrier installed. Gordon's car's radiator flew out from its chassis and {{into the path of}} <b>oncoming</b> <b>traffic.</b> Kenseth slid but was able to straighten his car and continue. The final caution was initially waved before a red-flag was shown, which stopped the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track. The race resumed 17 minutes later, with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle. Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career. Earnhardt finished second, ahead of Biffle in third place, Harvick in fourth, and Burton in fifth. Ragan, Kahne, Kvapil, Hamlin, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers. Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

50|$|As {{the light}} turns green, the left-turning car will rapidly proceed left {{ahead of the}} {{opposing}} traffic, frequently with the signaled assent of the opposing traffic. By accepting a modest delay in going straight, the opposing traffic has saved the left-turning traffic waiting an entire light cycle to turn left, as well as saved an equivalent amount of time for all the cars that {{otherwise would have been}} stuck behind the left-turning car. In situations where there is so much <b>oncoming,</b> straight <b>traffic</b> that a left turn would not be otherwise possible during any part of the light cycle, the Pittsburgh left can allow a line of left turning traffic to proceed incrementally.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{bottleneck}} {{limiting the}} flow of traffic which causes {{an increase in the}} density of cars (k) at location (xo). This causes a deceleration for all oncoming cars traveling at speed u to slow to speed vd. This shockwave will travel at the speed of the slope of line U-D on the fundamental diagram. The wave speed can be calculated as vshock = (qD &minus; qU)/(kD&minus;kU). This line delineates the congestion <b>traffic</b> from <b>oncoming</b> free-flow <b>traffic.</b> If the slope of U-D on the fundamental diagram is positive congestion will continue downstream of the highway. If it has a negative slope the congestion will continue upstream (see figure a). This deceleration is the case I of Riemann’s problem (see figure b and c).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} augmented in-vehicle information on driver behavior in work zones. In-vehicle information systems (IVISs) can increase driver awareness to an <b>oncoming</b> change in <b>traffic</b> flow and provide specific guidelines for driving speed requirements, for example. Three variations of IVISs were examined as the drivers entered a work zone in a simulated driving environment. The first was a control condition, which used only traditional signage and no IVIS. The second condition had the addition of visual in-vehicle warnings and the final condition the addition of auditory in-vehicle warnings. Results indicated that adding in-vehicle warnings did affect driver compliance to the work zone speed limit. Further, participants in the audio warning condition responded more quickly to the warning than in the visual condition. These were each respectively different from the drivers in the control condition. Conclusions and implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Performed for the University of Michigan Industry Affiliation Program for Human Factors in Transportation SafetyIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 12) "February 2003. "In {{a survey}} conducted over 34 years ago, Hare and Hemion (1968) found that United States drivers underuse their high beams in circumstances in which their use is recommended. High-beam use was also found to be inversely related to traffic density. Since that time, changes in beam pattern design, dimming controls, and perhaps driver awareness of the hazards of limited visibility may have sufficiently altered the situation to warrant a follow-up investigation. A survey of high-beam headlamp use was conducted on three unlit local roadways in the Ann Arbor area. Observers judged whether vehicles that were clear of both <b>oncoming</b> and preceding <b>traffic</b> had their high or low beams turned on. Illuminance measures at approximate beam pattern locations were also recorded to support beam judgments. In addition, traffic density was estimated over 15 -minute intervals so {{that the relationship between}} beam use and traffic density could be examined.

This combination of features allows us to easily collect large-scale data on interesting phenomena regarding the interaction between multiple user drivers, which is not possible with current single-user driving simulators. The core original contribution {{of this article is}} threefold: (1) we introduce a multiuser driving simulator based on DiVE, our original massively multiuser networked 3 D virtual environment; (2) we introduce OpenV 2 X, a middleware for simulating vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication; and (3) we present two experiments based on our CPSS platform.
