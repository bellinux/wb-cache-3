50|$|On July 1, 1986 the old cutter {{was bought}} from the {{fishermen}} Zygmunt Krukowski and Krzystof Klarwacki by Stanislaw Konopka,.

The price was 15'000 old Polish Zloty; this is now (due to the high inflation that followed) about the price of <b>one</b> <b>bread.</b> The new ship-owner decided to rebuild the cutter as a sailing yacht so the boat was towed to Puck, where it was put {{out of the water and}} moved to the fishing harbor. In 1986 the hull and the used-out motor were dismantled. From the original vessel only the backbone, ribs and planks from underwater part were left. After that the hull was rebuilt in a slightly changed shape. The boards were made two planks higher along the side of the hull and four planks higher at the stern. Under the wooden backbone (keel) a six meter long, a I-shaped steel ballast beam was fixed. In 1990 the newly rebuilt hull was transported to Jastarnia were the reconstruction of the yacht was meant to be finished. Unfortunately the construction company did not fulfill the contract. The hull was this time transported to Gdynia and placed on the embankment of Yacht Club “Stal” from which the shipowner was a member. The last stage of the reconstruction lasted until October 1994. The interior was finished by boat builder Leszek Fryzkowski supported by the ship owner Grzegorz Woźniak.|$|E

5000|$|Complex reasons {{underlie}} the belief. In 1 Corinthians 10, it is written: [...] "The chalice of benediction which we bless, {{is it not}} the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking {{of the body of}} the Lord? For we, being many, are <b>one</b> <b>bread,</b> one body: all that partake of one bread." [...] Since all Christians are now no longer of a unity that would allow common celebration of the Eucharist between them all, the bread being a visible sign of union, communion is not taken together between separated Churches and communities. Additionally as described in 1Co 11:29: [...] "For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body." [...] It is deemed better to prevent outsiders from taking communion than to risk them taking communion [...] "unworthily". Catholics thus see the communion as sinful {{for those who do not}} recognise the Real Presence or who are otherwise 'unworthy', i.e. who are not in the 'right place' to accept the Eucharist (free of mortal sin). Christian communities that keep close communion often also have accountability within those members that partake of the communion, so that they do not run afoul of this problem. Such communities will also delay taking communion until the members (the church body) can take communion in Christian unity, as required by 1Co 11:33 [...] "Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Church's sacraments are ordained {{for helping}} {{man in the}} spiritual life. But the spiritual life is {{analogous}} to the corporeal, since corporeal things bear a resemblance to spiritual. There is only one sacrament in the Eucharist. I Corinthians 10,17 [...] "For we, being many, are <b>one</b> <b>bread</b> one body, all that partake of one bread." [...] It is clear that the Eucharist is the sacrament of the Church's unity. This is to say that, just as Baptism is necessary for salvation, and can be obtained by desire, so can the Eucharist be obtained by desire. Baptism is the beginning of spiritual life. Baptism ordains a man for the reception of the Eucharist, which nourishes the spiritual life. Augustine explaining John 6, 54: [...] "This food and this drink, namely, of His flesh and blood: He would have us understand the fellowship of His body and members, which is the Church in His predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified, His body and believing ones. No one should entertain the slightest doubt, that then every one of this faithful becomes a partaker of the body and blood of Christ, when in Baptism he is made a member of Christ's body, nor is he deprived of his share in that body and chalice even though he depart from this world in the unity of Christ's body before he eats that bread and drinks that chalice." [...] Damascene says that it is called Communion because we communicate with Christ through it, both because we partake of His flesh and Godhead, and because we communicate with and are united to one another through it. It is called the Eucharist because it is the [...] "good grace" [...] because it leads to the grace of God everlasting (Romans 4,23); or because it really contains Christ, Who is full of grace. The sacrament was instituted by Christ, of Whom it is said (Mark 7,37) that He did all things well. Eusebius says [...] "Since He was going to withdraw His assumed body from their eyes, and bear it away to the stars, it was needful that {{on the day of the}} supper He should consecrate the sacrament of His body and blood for our sakes, in order that what was once offered up for our ransom should be fittingly worshiped in a mystery." [...] Without faith in the Passion there could never be any salvation. Romans 3, 25: [...] "Whom God has proposed to be propitiation, through faith in His blood." [...] The chief sacrament of the Old Law was the Paschal Lamb. I Corinthians 5, 7: [...] "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed." [...] Augustine (. ad januar, i) [...] "In order to commend more earnestly the depth of this mystery, our Savior willed this last act to be fixed in the hearts and memories of the disciples whom He was about to quit for the Passion." [...] And I Corinthians 5, 7-8: [...] "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed; therefore let us feast.. with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth." [...] Wheat is the appropriate matter for the bread of the host. John 12,24: [...] "Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it remains alone." [...] Therefore, Christ has compared Himself to the grain of wheat. The presence of Christ's true body and blood in this sacrament cannot be detected by sense, nor understanding, but by faith alone, which rests upon the Divine authority. Luke 22,19: [...] "This is My Body, which shall be delivered up for you." [...] Cyril says [...] "Doubt not whether this is true; but take rather the Savior's words with faith; for since He is the Truth and He does not lie." ...|$|E
40|$|The sign {{of unity}} in the <b>one</b> <b>Bread</b> Christ’s gesture of {{breaking}} bread at the Last Supper, which gave the entire Eucharistic Action its name in apostolic times, signifies that the many faithful are made one body by receiving Communion from the <b>one</b> <b>Bread</b> of Life which is Christ. It is most desirable that the faithful, just as the priest himself is bound to do, receive the Lord’s Body from hosts consecrated at the same Mass and that, in the instances when it is permitted, they partake of the chalice (cf. no. 283), so that even {{by means of the}} signs Communion will stand out more clearly as a participation in the sacrifice actually being celebrated. The meaning of the sign demands that the material for the Eucharistic Celebration truly have the appearance of food.
