5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream {{features}} more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots {{to create a sense}} of isolation.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans {{subsequently}} {{planned a}} simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around {{the cities of}} Masan, Kyongju, Taegu, Yongch'on and the Naktong Bulge. What followed was two weeks <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> brutal fighting as the two sides vied to control the routes into Pusan. Initially successful in some areas, the North Koreans were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force. The North Korean army, again stalled at the failure of this offensive, was subsequently destroyed in the UN counterattack at Inchon.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune are made <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> dark material, likely organic {{compounds}} processed by radiation, {{similar to that}} found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E

5|$|The {{upcoming}} generation <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> large telescopes (ELTs) {{will require}} sophisticated adaptive optics {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced adaptive optics system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its adaptive optics system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E
5|$|Though Andrew {{was a small}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan, it caused extreme damage, especially in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. The vast majority of the damage was as a result <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> high winds, although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana. Throughout the areas affected, almost 177,000people were left homeless. Outside of the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, effects were widespread, although damage was minimal. Overall, $26.5billion in losses and 65fatalities were attributed to Andrew, with some estimates ranging as high as $34billion. Andrew was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time, but is now fifth following hurricanes Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), and Ike (2008).|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid has a number <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are {{as wide as the}} asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Steered {{northwest}} by an anticyclone over northern Mexico and {{a developing}} upper-level low west of Southern California, the nascent cyclone steadily organized over warm waters. A ship about 105mi (165km) {{from the center}} reported sustained winds of 48mph (77km/h), supporting an upgrade to Tropical Storm Greg by 18:00UTC on September5. In spite of dissipating banding features, a large mass <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> deep convection developed near the center that night. Radar out of Los Cabos indicated that an eye {{was in the process}} of forming by early on September6, and Greg was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane in conjunction with satellite intensity estimates by 18:00UTC that day. Six hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg). Greg maintained its status for many more hours, even though outflow became restricted to the northeast and low-level cloud lines near the storm's eye became exposed.|$|E
5|$|These {{simulations}} {{showed the}} basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller extreme trans-Neptunian objects into similar types of orbits. It was a basic proof of concept simulation that did not obtain a unique orbit for the planet as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the extreme objects with an orbit for the planet. But {{they were the first}} to notice there was a clustering in the orbits <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> distant objects and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. Their work is very similar to how Alexis Bouvard noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups <b>of</b> <b>extremely</b> reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
