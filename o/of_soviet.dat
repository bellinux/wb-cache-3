5|$|The primary duty of {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} was directing the general line <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> foreign policy. The MER represented the country abroad and participated in talks with foreign delegations {{on behalf of the}} Soviet government. It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations abroad and the promotion <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> culture abroad. A less visible {{duty of the}} MER was its role in the coordination <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> intelligence operations abroad.|$|E

5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> strength, but a misperception <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> strategic intentions.|$|E

5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

5|$|In Moscow, between November and December 1964, at two {{sessions}} of the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Soviet leaders discussed the topic <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{military aid to}} North Vietnam. Although details of the discussions were not made public, the first indication <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> strategy in Vietnam came on 24 December 1964, when the Soviet government invited the North Vietnamese-backed National Liberation Front to open a permanent mission in Moscow. Then on 4 February 1965 McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Johnson, arrived in Saigon {{to meet with the}} then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, General Maxwell Taylor, to discuss the political situation in the country.

5|$|Soviet Armenians, on {{the other}} hand, were mostly {{genocide}} survivors who never fully integrated into Soviet life after their repatriation in the 1940s. The large-scale emigration <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> Armenians, mainly to Western countries, began in 1956. About 30,000 Soviet Armenians entered the country from 1960 to 1984, and another 60,000 moved throughout the late 1980s, during the Perestroika era. The total number <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> Armenian emigrants from 1956 to 1989, over 80% {{of them to the}} US, is estimated at 77,000.|$|E
50|$|The All-Russian Congress <b>of</b> <b>Soviets</b> was {{the supreme}} {{governing}} body <b>of</b> the Russian <b>Soviet</b> Federative Socialist Republic from 1917 until 1936, effectively. The 1918 Constitution of the Russian SFSR mandated that Congress shall convene {{at least twice}} a year, with the duties of defining (and amending) the principles <b>of</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Constitution and ratifying peace treaties. The October Revolution ousted the provisional government, making the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Soviets</b> the sole, and supreme governing body.

5|$|The reform's clearest {{effect was}} {{to reduce the}} {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> industrial labour that was paid by piece-rate, and by August 1962, 60.5 percent <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> workers were paid by piece-rate, down from the 1956 level of 75 percent. Around half of those who remained on piece-rates would continue to receive some kind of bonus payment, but the progressive piece-rate bonuses were mostly eliminated, with only 0.5 percent of workers continuing to receive them in 1962. Workers who were taken off piece-rate payments were then paid an hourly rate or received a salary.|$|E
5|$|The view of {{communism}} was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by {{agents of the}} USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, Elizabeth Bentley, repudiated the USSR and provided a list <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> spies in the US to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the Venona decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US. The growing influence {{of communism}} {{around the world and}} the evidence <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> spies within the US motivated the Department of Justicespearheaded by the FBIto initiate an investigation of communists within the US.|$|E

5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} a springboard for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> demands, which included the installation <b>of</b> <b>Soviet</b> military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E
