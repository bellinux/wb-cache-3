5|$|Silkies lay a {{fair number}} of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active <b>or</b> <b>aggressive</b> birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E

The {{treatment}} of refractory <b>or</b> relapsed <b>aggressive</b> non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in {{patients in a}} state of poor health is difficult due to their ineligibility to receive intensive salvage chemotherapy. In the present study, 16 refractory <b>or</b> relapsed <b>aggressive</b> NHL patients with a poor performance status or comor-bidities were treated with mitoxantrone, etoposide, bleomycin and dexamethasone (MEBD) therapy. The treatment consisted of 10 mg/m 2 intravenous (IV) mitoxantrone on day 1, 75 mg/m...|$|R
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive <b>or</b> <b>aggressive</b> skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, and how much effect they have on other units, whether they used passive <b>or</b> <b>aggressive</b> skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E

25|$|A marine {{aquarium}} is an aquarium that keeps marine {{plants and animals}} in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria.

FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, {{as a means of}} more natural biological filtration.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of the {{amygdala}} results in augmented aggressive behavior in hamsters, while lesions of an evolutionarily homologous {{area in the}} lizard greatly reduce competitive drive and aggression (Bauman et al. 2006). In rhesus monkeys, neonatal lesions in {{the amygdala}} or hippocampus results in reduced expression of social dominance, related to the regulation of aggression and fear. Several experiments in attack-primed Syrian golden hamsters, for example, support the claim of circuity within the amygdala being involved in control of aggression. The role of the amygdala is less clear in primates and appears to depend more on situational context, with lesions leading to increases in either social affiliatory <b>or</b> <b>aggressive</b> responses.|$|E
