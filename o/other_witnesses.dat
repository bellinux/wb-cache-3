5|$|Amongst <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> to Victor's wrath are tactless {{family friend}} Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' {{neighbour}} on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{maintained that}} the killer's claim to be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. <b>Other</b> <b>witnesses</b> told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but <b>other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
50|$|Humiliation play is also {{connected}} to sexual fetishism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and {{also may be}} associated with exhibitionism in the sense of wanting <b>others</b> to <b>witness</b> (or being aroused by <b>others</b> <b>witnessing)</b> one's sexual degradation.|$|R

5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, <b>other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. <b>Other</b> <b>witnesses</b> for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosecutor}} also withheld <b>other</b> <b>witness</b> {{statements from}} the defense. A local bird watcher witnessed the crime through his binoculars and took down a license plate number. He reported the tip through the Crime Stoppers tip line.|$|R

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>witnesses</b> for {{the plaintiffs}} {{included}} a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified {{that she had seen}} the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was acquitted}} {{on all four}} counts brought against him. Celestin, who shares a story credit on The Birth of a Nation, was convicted of sexual assault and {{received}} a six-month to one-year prison sentence in 2001, later raised to {{two to four years}} per state sentencing guidelines. Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges. Despite the accuser's willingness to testify at a second trial, prosecutors declined because <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> had scattered all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
60|$|Sir Oliver {{received}} this news from that <b>other</b> <b>witness,</b> the parson, who himself had suffered such rudeness at Godolphin's hands, and who, {{man of the}} Gospel and of peace though he was, entirely supported the Justice's decision--or so he declared.|$|R
25|$|The leaked IPCC {{documents}} {{also indicated}} that an additional three shots had missed Menezes. One witness claimed that the shots were evenly distributed over a timespan of thirty seconds.

5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross-examination}} {{of him and}} <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> by Birkett swayed the jury, {{and they}} took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact committed the murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} accounts for Pulaski's {{time and place}} of burial vary considerably. According to several contemporary accounts there were witnesses, including Pulaski's aide-de-camp, that Pulaski received a symbolic burial in Charleston on October 21, sometime after he was buried at sea. <b>Other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> including Captain Samuel Bulfinch of the Wasp however, claimed that the wounded Pulaski was actually later removed from the ship and taken to the Greenwich plantation {{in the town of}} Thunderbolt, near Savannah, where he died and was buried.|$|E

5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of <b>other</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{transferred}} to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like <b>other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while {{the two men had}} disagreed over the merits of the Super, that he saw nothing dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy {{moved through the}} pantry facing east. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. <b>Other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of <b>other</b> <b>witnesses,</b> including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later <b>other</b> <b>witnesses</b> disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E
