5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> its mouth. Camels mate by having {{both male and female}} sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} they drew {{inspiration}} from the previous film adaptations of Treasure Island for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to [...] "clear his mind of stereotypes", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor Wallace Beery, whom he [...] "loved {{because of the way}} he talked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his mouth." [...] For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because [...] "there was a whole attitude, a posture" [...] wherein [...] "you felt the pain and the youthful innocence", and he also cited the film Braveheart because [...] "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes." ...|$|E

This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters which improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like Argus, Furious was flush-decked and lacked an island superstructure to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable charthouse forward, on the flight deck centreline. The ship could normally only carry about 36 aircraft.|$|E

The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard Furious in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side. Furiouss long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.|$|E
500|$|Flynn has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from film critics. Kirk Baird of The Blade [...] described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him [...] "loveable". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast." [...] Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a [...] "fop", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him [...] "bland". The Scotsman wrote, [...] "it's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from" [...] the film.|date = January 27, 2015|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd|last = |first = }} Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn [...] "a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk". Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not [...] "all that heroic". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's [...] "sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his mouth [...] makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E
