An intrepid {{adamantine}} man this Bouille:--had he stood in old Broglie's place, in those Bastille days, {{it might have been}} all different! He has extinguished mutiny, and immeasurable civil war. Not for nothing, as we see; yet at a rate which he and Constitutional Patriotism considers cheap. Nay, as for Bouille, he, urged by subsequent contradiction which arose, declares coldly, it was rather against his own private mind, and more by public military rule of duty, that he did extinguish it, (Bouille, i. 175.)--immeasurable civil war being now the only chance. Urged, we say, by subsequent contradiction! Civil war, indeed, is Chaos; and in all vital Chaos, there is new Order shaping itself free: but what a faith this, that of all new Orders out of Chaos and Possibility of Man and his Universe, Louis Sixteenth and Two-Chamber Monarchy were precisely the one that would shape itself! It is like undertaking to throw deuce-ace, say only five hundred successive times, and any other throw to be fatal--for Bouille. Rather thank Fortune, and Heaven, always, thou intrepid Bouille; and let contradiction of its way!

5000|$|The Court's 1978 {{ruling in}} Parker v. Flook, {{was similar to}} Benson in principle. The Benson and Flook cases also {{established}} that a [...] "clue" [...] to whether a patent might be granted on a process was whether the process was carried out with a particular apparatus or else effectuated a transformation of an article from <b>one</b> state <b>or</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>another</b> state <b>or</b> <b>thing.</b> In Flook, where the sole departure from the prior art was concededly the formula or algorithm, no transformation was alleged, and it was conceded that the implementing apparatus was old or conventional, the process was simply {{not the kind of}} process that could be patented. The principle, stated in Flook, that to be patent eligible the implementation of an abstract idea or law of nature must be inventive, rather than routine or conventional, became of paramount importance in Supreme Court jurisprudence {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.

2500|$|Turning {{finally to}} Bilski's method, {{the court held}} it patent-ineligible. First, the court said, Bilski did not argue that the {{rejected}} claims recited any specific or [...] "particular" [...] machine, so that the court found it unnecessary to decide any issues relating to the machine-implementation branch of the test. [...] "We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, {{as well as the}} answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine." [...] Second, the court turned to transformation of articles from <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> state to <b>another.</b> What is an [...] "article"? Benson had made it clear that tanning hides, smelting ores, and vulcanizing rubber were all instances of transforming articles. This corresponded to the transformation test as the PTO and some amici curiae articulated it: one physical substance is transformed into a second physical substance. But what of electronic signals and electronically manipulated data? Or even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, which the Bilski case involved? No Supreme Court precedents addressed such entities.|$|R
2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Bilski v. Kappos affirmed but sharply qualified the Federal Circuit's 2008 en banc {{decision in}} In re Bilski. The decision announced a [...] "machine-or-transformation" [...] test of patent eligibility that, {{if it had}} been accepted as the exclusive for process patents, would have made ineligible many business-method patents granted in the last decade. Although the Supreme Court rejected its exclusive use, the test is still important as a [...] "useful and important clue" [...] for determining patent eligibility of claimed process inventions. Under this test. first, processes that transform an article from <b>one</b> state <b>or</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>another</b> are patent eligible regardless of whether their use requires a machine. Processes involving transformation of abstract financial data, such as that claimed in machine format in State Street, are probably patent ineligible. Second, processes that do not make patent-eligible transformations are patent eligible only if they are claimed to be carried out with a “particular machine.” It appears that a programmed general-purpose digital computer is not a particular machine, for this purpose. It is unclear from Bilski whether a particular machine must be novel and nonobvious, and specially adapted for carrying out the new process. [...] The Supreme Court’s decision in Parker v. Flook seems to call for that, but the Bilski court did not choose to opine on this point at that time.|$|R
