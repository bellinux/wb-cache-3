5|$|Rogers was {{not working}} {{completely}} alone in American locomotive manufacturing. In 1837, in addition to building the company's first locomotive, Rogers also filled orders from fellow locomotive builders Matthias W. Baldwin (founder of Baldwin Locomotive Works) and William Norris (founder of Norris Locomotive Works) for locomotive tires <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes.</b> Once Rogers started working on his own locomotives, however, no further orders from either Baldwin or Norris were forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper.

5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes.</b> Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries, {{the first}} devotional hymns {{were created in}} the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the {{resurgence}} of Hinduism {{and the development of}} all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th {{century the}} Polish lands {{were still on}} the {{peripheries}} of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found. Poland was populated by many tribes <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes.</b> The names of some of them, mostly from {{the western part of the}} country, are known from written sources, especially a Latin document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Trunajaya's forces harassed the loyalist army. They had {{fortified}} posts {{along the}} river, {{especially on the}} east bank. These were equipped with cannons <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> up to twelve-pounders. Trunajaya's artillery continuously pounded the loyalists, even reaching Hurdt and Amangkurat's lodgings, {{as well as the}} army's field hospital. The loyalist army also had cannons, but it did not return fire, saving its limited ammunition for the eventual attack on Kediri. In addition, Trunajaya's cavalry also engaged in skirmishes with the loyalists, causing casualties and undermining their morale. On 21 October, a night attack led by Raden Suradipa burned the VOC's Malay troops' quarters. However, the attack was repelled and Suradipa, one of Trunajaya's brothers, was fatally wounded. On the night of 2–3 November, Trunajaya's skirmishers intimidated the VOC's sentries with the music of gamelan and mocking voices.|$|E
5|$|San Marco has {{a number}} of parks <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> and purposes; the San Marco Preservation Society lists {{fourteen}} within its boundaries. There are two more in the Southbank: Treaty Oak Park, home of one of Jacksonville's oldest live oaks, and Friendship Fountain Park. Other amenities on the Southbank include the Museum of Science and History (MOSH) and the Southbank Riverwalk. San Marco is served by an elementary school, a middle school, and the Southside Branch Public Library. Two major projects of the San Marco Preservation Society have been the restoration of the former South Jacksonville City Hall as the society's headquarters and the conversion of the former St. Paul's Episcopal Church building into Preservation Hall, a reservable banquet hall.|$|E

There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E

5|$|Worlebury Camp (also {{known as}} Worlebury Hillfort) {{is the site}} of an Iron Age hillfort on Worlebury Hill, north of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. The fort was {{designed}} for defence, as is evidenced by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down on the hillside. Nearly one hundred storage pits <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> were cut into the bedrock, and many of these had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places <b>of</b> <b>various</b> <b>sizes</b> to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
