5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E

30|$|The {{utilization}} of Bokbunja (Rubus coreanus) sludge {{as a source}} of reductant was investigated to develop an eco-friendly indigo dyeing process. Total sugar contents were 18.94 and 50.87 % for ethanol and water extracts, respectively. The extract was effective to reduce indigo dye. Reduction of indigo was occured rapidly in the solution containing the extract and indigo dye in alkaline condition and it reached to the maximum color yield in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>day.</b> The reduction potential of the extract was stabilized between - 550  mV and - 600  mV depending on concentration of the extract.

5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons.

40|$|In {{the event}} study literature, {{estimates}} of security abnormal returns are considered independent whenever securities have different event dates, i. e. {{in the absence}} of 'event clustering'. Nonetheless, there are three sources of cross-sectional correlations in estimated abnormal returns even when no two securities have a common event date. First, the estimation interval (for market model parameters) may overlap; second, the event date for one security may overlap the estimation interval for another; third, event windows longer than a <b>one</b> (<b>or</b> <b>two)</b> <b>day</b> announcement may overlap. In this article, analytical and simulations methods are used to assess the influence of these partial overlaps. Simulations reveal that for short event windows (≤ 11 days, with 300 days in the estimation interval) these partial overlaps do not create any measurable bias, even when 50 separate events are contained within 125 trading days. However, there is potential for bias in 'long horizon' event studies with nearly clustered event dates. ...|$|R

On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire.

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen.

The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
