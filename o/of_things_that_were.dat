Prior to her arrival in São Paulo from Europe, the group had {{organized}} the Semana de Arte Moderna ("Week of Modern Art") {{during the week of}} February 11–18, 1922. The event was pivotal in the development of modernism in Brazil. The participants were interested in changing the conservative artistic establishment in Brazil by encouraging a distinctive mode of modern art. Tarsila was asked to join the movement and together they became the Grupo dos Cinco, which sought to promote Brazilian culture, the use of styles that were not specifically European, and the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> indigenous to Brazil.|$|E

Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular kind <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E

2500|$|On May 12, 2011, {{the band}} {{announced}} to fans via a live video chat that their new album would be titled Radiosurgery and {{they hoped to}} release it sometime in September.

2500|$|Rabbi Akiva {{interpreted}} the words [...] "and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean" [...] in [...] to teach {{that if the}} sprinkler sprinkled upon an unclean person, the person became clean, but if he sprinkled upon a clean person, the person became unclean.

But the Sages held that these effects of sprinkling applied only in the case <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> susceptible to uncleanness. The Gemara explained that the Rabbis' view could be deduced from the logical proposition that the greater includes the lesser: If sprinkling upon the unclean makes clean, how much more so should sprinkling upon the clean keep clean or make cleaner? And the Gemara said that it is with reference to Rabbi Akiva's position that Solomon said in Ecclesiastes [...] "I said, ‘I will get wisdom,' but it is far from me." [...] That is, even Solomon could not explain it.|$|E

2500|$|Kan-ying may be defined, in {{the final}} analysis, as the power of things to affect and to be {{affected}} {{in such a way}} as to bring about harmony. This power is based on the persistent affinity and attraction <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> originally one, but that became scattered when the world began. Through the True Man kan-ying recreates the original unity. As a dynamic pattern kan-ying expresses the full cycle of cosmological, social and psychological integration. Its natural and universal character makes it binding for the cosmos as a whole and also for each and every one of the Ten Thousand Things issuing from Tao. In Chapter Six the foregoing pattern is applied mainly to the realm of human society and, more specifically, to the relations between the perfect ruler – the True Man - and the people. The argument there propounded, that these relations should be based on non-action (wu-wei) understood as resonance (kan-ying), draws its ultimate strength from the cosmological scheme outlined above. We may thus conclude that kan-ying not only forms a logically coherent and philosophically meaningful idea but also provides the focal point around which the Huai-nan Tzu cosmology is structured.

2500|$|First, it is {{important}} to note that Serbia did not hand over to the Prosecution (OTP) the complete collection of SDC [...] records. For example, for the year 1995 the OTP received recordings for only about half of all the sessions held by SDC. Further, some of the SDC records were not handed over in their full stenographically recorded form but were produced as extended minutes. That means that they were shorter than steno-notes but longer than the regular minutes. The dates of the missing meetings or the meetings where this lesser form of record was provided, as I recall, were significant – namely dates leading up to, surrounding and in the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre. The full records of those meetings need yet to be provided. At the same time, these documents, significant as they are, do not constitute a single body of evidence that will explain once and for all what happened and who was culpable. They do provide a much fuller context and provide some very valuable testimonials <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> said by Milošević and others. In their un-redacted form they would point all who are interested (not just governments and lawyers) to other documents that have never been provided and that might well be more candid than the words of those at the SD Council meetings who knew they were being recorded by a stenographer. Second, it should also be remembered that there are other protected document collections and individual documents which were, and still are, protected by direct agreements between Belgrade and the former OTP Prosecutor, i.e. they were not protected by the Trial Chamber. These documents are difficult now to identify but if and when Bosnia-Herzegovina decides to reopen the ICJ case it will be essential to require Serbia and/or the ICTY to produce all those documents for the ICJ.|$|E
2500|$|... 1998 {{marked the}} release of the third Rasmus album Hell of a Tester (sometimes written Hellofatester). The album was {{released}} on 2 November and marks a change in their musical style from funk to more solid rock. The album received Gold status in Finland. The most popular single was [...] "Liquid", which was released in September, getting into the Top 40 on MTV Nordic. It was voted Single of the Year for 1998 by music critics and fans and the video won an award in 1999 at the Finnish Music Video Awards. Lauri wrote Liquid on Lauttasaari bridge. The band also wrote religious material which never saw daylight. During 1999 Rasmus were headlining big festivals in Finland. Janne Heiskanen left the band after playing his last gig supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers. Janne decided to retire himself in meditation in India, where he lived for some years. This left the band in disarray and were close to breaking up. Aki Hakala, who had previously sold merchandise for the band, was eventually asked to become the new drummer. Together with Killer and Kwan they formed the Dynasty association a small, independent record label for recruiting new Finnish artists. In 2000 the band changed their name from [...] "Rasmus" [...] to [...] "The Rasmus" [...] to avoid confusion with the Swedish DJ of the same name (another artist, British Rasmus Gardell, has also used the name). In late 1999 The Cardigans' manager Petri H. Lundén recommended the band to Lars Tengroth, director of new Swedish independent label Playground Music. Tengroth went to see them play live in Helsinki and, as he later told HitQuarters, [...] "fell in love with them straight away". Having released three albums in Finland and achieved modest success they were looking to develop their career outside of the country and Playground agreed to help them do this. In late 2000 the band began working with producers Martin Hansen & Micke Nord in Sweden for their next album, ending up leaving their former funk sound completely behind and changing the style into straight forward pop rock. Once signed to Playground the band spent time developing their act {{to meet the demands of}} establishing themselves internationally. According to Tengroth: [...] "It was like starting from scratch; we were creating a new band so to speak." [...] They did a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> new to them – they spent a long time working on their songs before recording, they worked with producers for the first time, and they recorded outside of Finland. They already had a strong stage show but welcomed ideas in improving it further.|$|E
