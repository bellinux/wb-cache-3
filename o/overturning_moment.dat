However, seismic performance and the demands of ATC towers differ significantly from common structures. In this paper, the seismic performance of Kuala Lumpur International Airport traffic control tower, with a height of 120 m, was investigated. The results showed that in comparison to modal response spectrum analysis, equivalent static analysis overestimated <b>overturning</b> <b>moments,</b> drifts, maximum displacement and demand/capacity ratio.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{three-dimensional}} finite element analyses of circular footings under combinations of vertical load, horizontal load and moment {{are presented in}} this paper. The soil {{is assumed to be}} uniform and homogeneous and deforms under undrained conditions. These studies include the performance of the foundations under large <b>overturning</b> <b>moments</b> and large horizontal loads. The contact between the soil and the rigid footing is unable to sustain tension and therefore allowance is made for breakaway under large <b>overturning</b> <b>moments.</b> The results of the analyses are presented {{in the form of a}} failure locus in the vertical, horizontal and moment loading space. A comparison is made between the results of the current analysis and a simple method commonly used in calculation of the bearing capacity of foundations. It is shown that, while the hypothesis of an effective footing width provides a good approximation to the effects of load eccentricity, the conventional method overestimates the effects of load inclination for load combinations with a large horizontal shear component. A new factor is presented in this paper that can be used to describe the effects of load inclination more accurately when used with the simple method to calculate bearing capacity...|$|R

50|$|The usual methods {{employed}} to strengthen buildings are to reinforce it with significant extra structure or to install tuned mass dampers. Both methods {{are not only}} expensive, but also make the building stiffer and heavier while consuming valuable space. The Arup solution works by inserting Viscous Dampers into the St. Francis Shangri-La Place to act as energy absorbers and damp out vibrations. Viscous dampers connect deep reinforced concrete outriggers from the central core of each building to the perimeter columns at one level. The added damping so derived, in excess of 6% of critical controls wind-induced motions, achieving occupant comfort objectives, and reduces the design wind <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> {{by a factor of}} 1.7. Not only is this a lower-cost solution, it is also more sustainable as it uses less material, and leaves more valuable space inside the building.|$|E

50|$|A {{detailed}} stability {{review was}} performed by FaAA {{as part of its}} investigation. It opined that the ship was designed, built, and operated in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Standards. In 1988, the ship was modified to include a top drive unit. The stability effect of this modification was analyzed by FaAA, and it found that stability improved due to conversion of the No. 3 center tank to permanent ballast as part of the top drive modification. (FaAA never found the alleged ABS calculations and certification of the ship's stability with the top drive.) At the time of the capsize, FaAA opined the ship was operating within accepted stability standards. However, its investigation revealed errors in the wind <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> calculations performed by the shipbuilder and approved by ABS. Erroneous instructions in the operator's manual would allow the ship to be operated with the height of the vertical center of gravity above accepted limits, resulting in reduced stability margin. FaAA opined that while this could have been a serious issue in this situation, it was not, since the ship was operating at less than the maximum allowable vertical position of the center of gravity prior to the event.|$|E
5000|$|A {{small ship}} with two masts, both fore-and-aft rigged, with the mizzen located well {{forward of the}} {{rudderpost}} and of only slightly smaller size than the mainmast (if {{the height of the}} masts were reversed—the taller in the back and the shorter in the front—it would be considered a schooner). If square rigged on her mainmast above the course, it is called a [...] "square topsail ketch". Historically the mainmast was square rigged instead of fore-and-aft, but in modern usage only the latter is called a ketch. The purpose of the mizzen sail in a ketch rig, unlike the mizzen on a yawl rig, is to provide drive to the hull. A ketch rig allows for shorter sails than a sloop with the same sail area, resulting in a lower center of sail and less <b>overturning</b> <b>moment.</b> The shorter masts therefore reduce the amount of ballast and stress on the rigging needed to keep the boat upright. Generally the rig is safer and less prone to broaching or capsize than a comparable sloop, and has more flexibility in sail plan when reducing sail under strong crosswind conditions—the mainsail can be brought down entirely (not requiring reefing) and the remaining rig will be both balanced on the helm and capable of driving the boat. The ketch is a classic small cargo boat.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: For large system level random {{vibration}} tests, {{there may be}} some concerns about the shaker's capability for the <b>overturning</b> <b>moment.</b> It is the test conductor's responsibility to predict and monitor the <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> during {{random vibration}} tests. If the predicted moment is close to the shaker's capability, test conductor must measure the instantaneous moment at low levels and extrapolate to higher levels. That data will be used to decide whether it is safe to proceed to the next test level. Challenge: Kistler analog formulation for computing the real-time moment is only applicable to very limited cases in which we have 3 or 4 load cells installed at shaker interface with hardware. Approach: To overcome that limitation, a simple procedure was developed for computing the <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> time histories using the measured time histories of the individual load cells...|$|E

Sabouri-Ghomi, Ventura and Kharrazi (2005) further refined the model and named it the Plate-Frame Interaction (PFI) model. In this paper, the PFI analytical model is then further enhanced by ‘modifying’ the load-displacement diagram to include the effect of <b>overturning</b> <b>moments</b> on the SPW response, hence the given name of the M-PFI model. The method also addresses bending and shear interactions of the plastic ultimate capacity of steel panels, as well as bending and shear interactions of the ultimate yield strength for each individual component, that is the steel plate and surrounding frame.|$|R
50|$|Type II hybrid masonry is {{constrained}} vertically by {{the steel}} frame; however, {{the sides of}} the panel still have a gap between the steel and the masonry. The vertical contact transfers the gravity load from the beam into the masonry panel, increasing its flexural and shear strength. Instead of the plates transferring the lateral force from the steel to the masonry, shear studs are welded to the bottom side of the beam. Grout is then used to fill the space between the masonry and the steel beam. With this contact, the wall is subject to story shears, gravity loads, as well as <b>overturning</b> <b>moments</b> much like a continuous shear wall.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{physical}} tree characteristics and soil shear strength on <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> due to flooding were investigated using Salix babylonica and Juglans ailanthifolia, exotic and invasive plants in Japanese rivers. Tree pulling experiments were conducted, {{and the resulting}} damage was examined {{in order to assess}} the effects {{of physical}} tree characteristics on the maximum <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> (Mmax). In situ soil shear strength tests were conducted in order to measure soil strength parameters. The effects of species differences on the Mmax were examined by analysis of the root architecture. S. babylonica has a heart-root system that produces a greater <b>overturning</b> <b>moment</b> due to the strong root anchorage and the large amount of substrate that must be mobilized during overturning. J. ailanthifolia has a plate-root system that produces a smaller <b>overturning</b> <b>moment.</b> However, trees with the plate-root system may withstand overturning better due to an increased root:shoot ratio. Considering the strategy of J. ailanthifolia to increase the root:shoot ratio for anchoring in the substrate, the trunk volume index (height*Dbh 2) is a better parameter than Dbh 2 because it indirectly involves the difference in belowground volume and surface area.

40|$|This study evaluates current Nonlinear Static Procedures (NSPs) {{specified}} in the FEMA 356, ASCE- 41, ATC- 40, and FEMA- 440 documents using strong-motion data from reinforced-concrete buildings. For this purpose, three-dimensional computer models of five reinforced concrete buildings – Imperial County Services Building, Sherman Oaks Commercial Building, North Hollywood Hotel, Watsonville Commercial Building, and Santa Barbara Office Building – are developed. When appropriate, springs at the building’s base are included {{to account for the}} soil-structure interaction effects. These buildings are selected because they were strongly shaken, several deformed beyond their linear-elastic range, during past earthquakes and their recorded motions are available. The recorded motions are interpolated to obtain motions at non-instrumented floors. These motions are used to derive seismic demands – peak roof (or target node) displacement, floor displacements, story drifts, story shears, and story <b>overturning</b> <b>moments.</b> The pushover curves are developed from nonlinear static analysis of computer models of these buildings and various demands estimated from the NSP methods. A comparison of peak roof (or target node) displacements estimated from the NSPs with the value derived from recorded motions shows that: (1) the NSPs either overestimate or underestimate the peak roof displacement for several of the buildings considered in this investigation; (2) the ASCE- 41 Coefficient Method (CM), which is based on recent improvements to the FEMA- 356 CM suggested in FEMA- 440 document, does not necessarily provide a better estimate of roof displacement; and (3) the improved FEMA- 440 Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) generally provides better estimates of peak roof displacements compared to the ATC- 40 CSM. However, there is no conclusive evidence that either the CM procedures (FEMA- 356 or ASCE- 41) or the CSM procedure (ATC- 40 or FEMA- 440) lead to a better estimate of the peak roof displacement when compared with the value derived from recorded motions. A comparison of the height-wise distribution of floor displacements, story drifts, story shears and story <b>overturning</b> <b>moments</b> indicates that the NSP provides: (1) reasonable estimate of floor displacements; (2) poor estimate of drifts in upper stories due to its inability to account for higher mode effects; (3) very poor, and possibly unreliable, estimates of story shears and story <b>overturning</b> <b>moments.</b> A comparison of pushover curves from various computer programs using different modeling assumptions led to significantly different pushover curves. This indicates significant sensitivity of pushover curves to modeling assumptions which may potentially lead to different results and conclusions from the NSP...|$|R

30|$|As widely known, {{from the}} axial load-bending {{interaction}} diagrams, {{it is possible}} to observe that both yielding and ultimate moments increase with the level of axial load until the balance point is achieved. Variation in the axial load during an earthquake can change the strength, stiffness and ultimate displacement capacity, as well as all the hysteretic properties of a RC section. Such variations can occur due to the vertical component of the seismic load, or in the external columns of the bottom storeys of RC frames, due to the <b>overturning</b> <b>moments</b> which increase the axial load on one side and decrease it on the opposite side.
