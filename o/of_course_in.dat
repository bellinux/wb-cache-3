25|$|The triumph was short-lived, and {{somewhat}} pyrrhic, however.

The 21-year-old Prince was therefore duly given the command of the army (with De Witt's grudging assent), just before the war started, making him share in the responsibility for the military debacle, which he, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>in</b> the circumstances could not avoid.

25|$|As {{a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial.

All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial {{when they returned}} his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later {{in the autumn of}} 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.|$|E

His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the [...] "software whitening" [...] stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of [...] "truly" [...] random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method.
