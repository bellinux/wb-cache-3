5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

500|$|Just Dance was {{developed}} by a small team of around 20 at Ubisoft Paris, and was only officially pitched six months prior to its eventual release. Poix explained that unlike the Raving Rabbids games, which he described as being a [...] "gamer's game", Just Dance was designed to contrast skill-based rhythm games with a concept and control scheme that would be accessible to a mainstream audience, encouraging them to [...] " [...] <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and [...] fun together". Ubisoft producer Florian Granger noted that Just Dance was designed to help players overcome their inhibitions and anxiety towards dance, helping them build a [...] "vocabulary" [...] of moves they can practice in a [...] "safe context", and with the game itself being {{the focal point of}} attention rather than themselves. He reminisced that [...] "everyone remembers going to a nightclub or school disco where it takes a couple of hours before anyone has the bottle to get up and dance. Most guys do the fix-placed-beer-bottle dance or neck-shake to the beat." ...|$|E

500|$|Riding the {{earnings}} from Solipskier, Mikengreg continued to pay themselves their same salary but now had {{the means to}} try new ideas. Wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six [...] "fairly polished prototypes" [...] over {{the development of their}} next game, Gasketball. They were able to live on $20–25,000 a year each in Iowa {{for the next two years}} while working on the new game. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus felt like their external pressure was low. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> Solipskier funds. In making Gasketball, Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had improved continually, but found the idea of a million-person audience [...] "daunting" [...] and Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate Solipskier success. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> of friends.|$|R
500|$|The Smith {{family have}} dinner together, and Stan {{talks about the}} events that {{occurred}} on a documentary on animals that aired earlier. Shortly after the conversation, Steve is {{the first person to}} finish his meal, much to Stan's surprise. Stan later becomes insecure about the incident, and he is afraid that his stance as the alpha male of the household will be dethroned. The next morning, when Steve is watching a movie on television, Stan abruptly pushes him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and claims it as his [...] "territory" [...] by peeing all over it. Steve becomes furious, and he tells Francine about the situation in the kitchen. Francine tells him that Stan is intimidated by him, and that he feels that he will be dethroned of his dominance by him. Puzzled, Steve talks to Stan about the issue and openly challenges him of his position as the dominant person in the household. Though Steve manages to outdo him in everything, Stan is inspired by a walrus documentary to do the one thing his son can not do: have sex. Turning to Roger for help, Steve is suggested to go to a party to get laid. Informed by Klaus of this, Stan rushes to the party to stop his son. However, upon arriving there, Stan learns that Steve's various attempts to have sex with a girl failed miserably as the boy is having a mental breakdown. Roger explains now there's no threat to Steve challenging Stan, and no threat of Steve's future son (whom shall never be born) challenging him. Stan later apologizes to him, and admits to having failed to raise him to be a man.|$|E

40|$|This Major Research Paper {{focused on}} the need for youth arts councils in the Niagara Region. Participation in youth councils offers {{adolescents}} a wealth of enriching experiences that can alter both their worldview as well as their understanding of themselves. On a youth arts council, adolescents can discover a new world of art and its cultural value. They can express themselves through their own art while sharing the experience with other teenagers who are doing the same. They can connect with these like-minded teens as they achieve personal goals and contribute to the welfare of the community. Therefore, in an era in which people are concerned about teens’ over-reliance on mobile devices and other so-called screen addictions, getting adolescents <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> or cell phone and onto a more participatory, productive path is important. This study illustrates how Niagara’s art galleries and art museums are cultural and historical ambassadors that can and must {{play a major role in}} helping students connect possibilities with engaging purpose while having fun...|$|R

6000|$|The little street near Buckingham Gate, {{where no}} wag had chalked [...] "Peace" [...] {{on the doors}} {{for nearly a year}} now, had an arid look after a hot day's sun. The hair-dresser's shop below his rooms was still open, and the private door ajar: 'I won't ring,' she thought; 'I'll go {{straight}} up.' While she was mounting the two flights of stairs, she stopped twice, breathless, from a pain in her side. She often had that pain now, as if the longing in her heart strained it physically. On the modest landing at the top, outside his rooms, she waited, leaning against the wall, which was covered with a red paper. A window at the back was open and the confused sound of singing came in--a chorus [...] "Vive-la, vive-la, vive-la ve. Vive la compagnie." [...] So it came to her. 'O God!' she thought: 'Let him be in, let him be nice to me. It's the last time.' And, sick from anxiety, she opened the door. He was in--lying on a wicker-couch against the wall in the far corner, with his arms crossed behind his head, and a pipe in his mouth; his eyes were closed, and he neither moved, nor opened them, perhaps supposing her to be the servant. Noiseless as a cat, Leila crossed the room till she stood above him. And waiting for him to come out of that defiant lethargy, she took her fill of his thin, bony face, healthy and hollow at the same time. With teeth clenched on the pipe it had a look of hard resistance, as of a man with his head back, his arms pinioned to his sides, stiffened against some creature, clinging and climbing and trying to drag him down. The pipe was alive, and dribbled smoke; and his leg, the injured one, wriggled restlessly, as if worrying him; but the rest of him was as utterly and obstinately still as though he were asleep. His hair grew thick and crisp, not a thread of grey in it, the teeth which held the pipe glinted white and strong. His face was young; so much younger than hers. Why did she love it--the face of a man who couldn't love her? For a second {{she felt as if she}} could seize the cushion which had slipped down <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and smother him as he lay there, refusing, so it seemed to her, to come to consciousness. Love despised! Humiliation! She nearly turned and stole away. Then through the door, left open, behind her, the sound of that chorus: [...] "Vive-la, vive-la, vive-la ve!" [...] came in and jolted her nerves unbearably. Tearing the gardenia from her breast, she flung it on to his upturned face.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 36 - 37) This study {{measured the}} photon beam attenuation {{characteristics of the}} Varian EXACT, Varian IGRT treatment couches and two CIVCO Universal extensions used during external beam radiotherapy; and assessed the accuracy of Varian's Eclipse treatment planning system in modeling the beam attenuation of each couch. Dose Measurements were taken using a Farmer ion chamber inside a cylindrical acrylic phantom. They were taken for two photon energies (6 MV and 15 MV), at three different field sizes, for various gantry angles through <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> EXACT <b>couch</b> was tested both with the adjustable rails pushed {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and pushed to the center of <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> was divided by thickness into three sections for more accurate representation of attenuation along the length of <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Effects on surface dose are measured using a Tissue Maximum Ratio for <b>the</b> Varian EXACT <b>couch,</b> and Percent Depth Dose curves for the Varian IGRT and CIVCO extensions. Both CIVCO extensions were introduced into the Eclipse planning system by tracing <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> structures as in viewed in Ct images. All measurements were modeled in the Eclipse treatment planning system for comparison. Maximum attenuation was measured at 6 MV with the smallest field for all <b>couch</b> setups. <b>The</b> EXACT <b>couch</b> produced a maximum attenuation of 19. 2 % and a surface dose increase of 47 % of D[subscript lower case max] through <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Maximum attenuation for <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> and both CIVCO extensions were between 6 - 8 %. Through <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> showed a surface dose increase of 29 % of D[subscript lower case max],; the CIVCO extensions produced a surface dose increase of 33 % and 7 % of D[subscript lower case max]. Maximum difference between measured and planned dose was 7 %, for <b>the</b> EXACT <b>couch,</b> 1. 9 % for <b>the</b> IGRT <b>couch</b> and 2. 4 % for both CIVCO extensions. These treatment couches were shown to affect delivered and surface dose. Including <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> structure during treatment planning can account for <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> attenuation in most cases, but some attenuation values are underestimated in the planning software. Largest effects are for oblique treatment angles using low energy and small field size...|$|R
