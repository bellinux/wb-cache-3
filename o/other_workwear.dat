5000|$|This {{image is}} used mainly to sell clothing, the top moneymaker for the company. [...] Sales in Europe are {{ten times the}} US, {{according}} to James. [...] At one time, there were five clothing lines, including two sold by West Coast Choppers, two at Wal-Mart, as well as high-end lines available in more expensive department stores, such as T-shirts for [...] "$100 a pop in Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Fred Segal". [...] Koral Industries of Vernon, California {{is responsible for the}} design and manufacture of WCC clothing, as well as supplying the sales force to place the products in stores. [...] Clothing items include hoodies, tank tops, T-shirts and jackets. [...] There is also a line of Jesse James/WCC-branded bib overalls and <b>other</b> <b>workwear.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ripstop fabrics {{are used}} in yacht sails and spinnakers, hot air balloons, kites, parachutes, and remote control hovercrafts. High quality camping {{equipment}} such as lightweight tents, sleeping bags, and camping hammocks tend to use ripstop {{in order to reduce}} the wear on their fabrics which are in direct contact with the ground or the wind. Swags, flags, banners, and other applications requiring a strong lightweight fabric use ripstop too. Ripstop reinforcements are incorporated into heavier fabrics requiring extreme durability, such as those used in Army Combat Uniforms, Nomex protective clothing for firefighters and <b>other</b> <b>workwear,</b> Brazilian Jiu Jitsu uniforms, outdoor and sports clothing, backpacks, and luggage bags. Self-adhesive ripstop patches are used to repair both rips and tears in other fabrics.Ejector seat parachutes made with ripstop are woven with an elastic-like fabric so that they stretch to allow more air to pass through at high speed. Then as the ejector seat slows, the weave closes and acts like a conventional parachute. This allows the pilot seat to slow gently, avoiding compression that could result in spinal injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{communal}} model grew {{around a}} number of other fishing and later UK marine ports, before the company was bought out by the son of one of the original founders, businessman (John) Carl Ross of the Ross Group. The company floated in 1971, and was chaired by his son; and then grandson David Ross, co-founder of the Carphone Warehouse. The original businesses has now developed into marine and industrial safety centre, and diversified into <b>other</b> markets, including: <b>Workwear</b> and Corporatewear.|$|R
40|$|INIRODUCTION Comfort is an {{important}} consideration determining the acceptability of fabrics used in workwear gannents, especiall,Y in the hot and humid environments often encountered in the wOIkplace. This research cOInpares Nomex<ll and <b>other</b> <b>workwear</b> fabrics {{on the basis of}} physical properties that influence their thermal and tactile cOInfort. A sweating skin model is used to compare thermal comfort factors in moderate and hot and humid envirOInuents. The Kawabata Evaluation System (KES) is used to characterize mechanical and surface proper-ties that control fabric softness and influence next-to-the-skin contact sensations. Vertical wicking is measured. Comfort predictions are translated to fabric construction parameters. The effects of laundering are examined since it is expected that worI [...] -wear clothing will be washed often. MEIHOD Table 1 identifies the shirting weight fabrics that were tested. Four are Nomex<ll fabrics used in military or industrial shirting applications (NSI-NS 4). One material is a lightweight Non-FR polyester/cotton used in ordinary clothing (CS 5)., TopicallY treated FR materials include an FR cotton sample (CS 6) and an FR poly-ester/cotton shirting fabric (CS 7) ...|$|E
