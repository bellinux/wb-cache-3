40|$|The pectoralis major myocutaneous pedicled flap is a {{commonly}} used flap for reconstructive {{head and neck}} surgery, but associated with high complication rates. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate a refined <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> that can reduce flap complications and compare the proposed technique with the conventional <b>surgical</b> <b>technique.</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on 35 consecutive patients affected by malignant tumors of the head and neck, who underwent a pectoralis major myocutaneous pedicled flap reconstruction in our institution, between 2004 and 2009. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 treated by the classic <b>surgical</b> <b>technique,</b> and group 2 treated by the refined <b>surgical</b> <b>technique.</b> Our main outcome measures were the success of the reconstructions and the complications. The overall complication rate in patients who underwent our revisited <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> was significantly lower than that in patients who underwent conventional <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> (P = 0. 001). The results of our study reinforce the value of the pectoralis major flap in the reconstruction of head and neck defects and shows how little refinement of the <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> can significantly reduce the onset of complications. © 2013 by Mutaz B.

40|$|Introduction: Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is {{performed}} in the treatment for vulvar cancer. One or more complications after IFL is reported in up to 85 % of the patients. This review presents an overview of <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> and peri- and post-operative care that has been studied {{in order to reduce}} the morbidity associated with IFL in vulvar cancer patients. Areas covered: Current knowledge on post-operative complications after different <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> and peri- and post-operative protocols were discussed. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library on 20 February 2017. In order to be eligible for inclusion, studies must report the associated post-operative morbidity per <b>surgical</b> <b>technique,</b> or peri- or post-operative care given after IFL in vulvar cancer patients. Expert commentary: After the implementation of several new <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques,</b> the morbidity after IFL decreased but remains high and clinically meaningful. More research is needed on <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> and peri-or post-operative care to further reduce the complication rates after IFL in vulvar cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|Background. A {{number of}} <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> for implant site {{preparation}} have been advocated {{to enhance the}} implant of primary and secondary stability. However, there is insufficient scientific {{evidence to support the}} association between the <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> and implant stability. Purpose. This review aimed to investigate the influence of different <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> including the undersized drilling, the osteotome, the piezosurgery, the flapless procedure, and the bone stimulation by low-level laser therapy on the primary and/or secondary stability of dental implants. Materials and methods. A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and grey literature was performed. The inclusion criteria comprised observational clinical studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in patients who received dental implants for rehabilitation, studies that evaluated the association between the <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> and the implant primary and/or secondary stability. The articles selected were carefully read and classified as low, moderate, and high methodological quality and data of interest were tabulated. Results. Eight clinical studies were included then they were classified as moderate or high methodological quality and control of bias. Conclusions. There is a weak evidence suggesting that any of previously mentioned <b>surgical</b> <b>techniques</b> could influence the primary and/or secondary implant stability...|$|R
