60|$|It {{must have}} been in the little streets--impassable for horses--that the people sat and talked, as Heine fabled, in their doorways, and touched knees with the people sitting and talking on the {{thresholds}} of the opposite side. But we saw no gossipers there <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Sunday</b> in Genoa; and I think the domestic race of Heine's day no longer lives in Genoa, for every body we saw on the streets was gayly dressed in the idea of the last fashions, and was to be met chiefly in the public promenades. The fashions were French; but here still lingers the lovely phantom of the old national costume of Genoa, and snow-white veils fluttered from many a dark head, and caressed many an olive cheek. It is the kindest and charitablest of attirements, this white veil, and, while decking beauty to the most perilous effect, befriends and modifies age and ugliness.|$|E

60|$|There was Great-grandfather King's flat {{tombstone}} {{of rough}} Island sandstone, so overgrown with ivy {{that we could}} hardly read its lengthy inscription, recording his whole history in brief, and finishing with eight lines of original verse composed by his widow. I {{do not think that}} poetry was Great-grandmother King's strong point. When Felix read it, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> first <b>Sunday</b> in Carlisle, he remarked dubiously that it LOOKED like poetry but didn't SOUND like it.|$|R

One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close <b>on</b> <b>Sunday.</b> <b>Our</b> decision to close <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> was <b>our</b> way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business." ...|$|R
