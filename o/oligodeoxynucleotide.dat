To improve brain protection during circulatory arrest in cardiac surgery, we evaluated the efficacy of nuclear factor-κB decoy <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> in preventing neuronal damage after global brain ischemia. Methods: Hemagglutinating virus of Japan–liposome complex with fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled nuclear factor-κB decoy <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> was injected through the carotid artery during 20 minutes of global brain ischemia in rats to evaluate the efficacy of transfecting the decoy <b>oligodeoxynucleotides.</b> The messenger RNA levels of several factors related to ischemia-reperfusion injury in the hippocampus were estimated by a real-time polymerase chain reaction method 1 hour after reperfusion. Neuronal damage was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining and by using immunohistochemical study of microtubule-associated protein 2 in the hippocampus CA- 1 region 7 days after ischemia. Results: Introduction of the nuclear factor-κB decoy <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> into rat brain neurons through the carotid artery during global brain ischemia was markedly successful. The polymerase chain reaction study showed that the transfected nuclear factor-κB decoy <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> effectively inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor α interleukin 1 β and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 messenger RNA 1 hour after global brain ischemia.

Although the protective effect of CpG-containing immunostimulatory <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> is clearly dependent on endogenous interleukin- 12 and interferon-γ production, {{the source of}} these Th 1 -promoting cytokines in infected mice is unknown. In contrast to macrophages from Leishmania-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice, macrophages from susceptible BALB/c mice are hyporesponsive to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. While studying interactions of various antigen-presenting cells with Leishmania, we found that BALB/c inflammatory skin macrophages, whether Leishmania-infected or uninfected, produced large amounts of interleukin- 12 when treated with CpG-containing immunostimulatory <b>oligodeoxynucleotides.</b> Like lipopolysaccharide, CpG-containing immunostimulatory <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> induced production of interferon-γ and release of nitric oxide by skin macrophages. Studies using skin macrophages from interleukin- 12 - and interferon-γ-deficient BALB/c mice demonstrated that nitric oxide release was not dependent on interleukin- 12 and interferon-γ production. Approximately 44 % and 27 % of intracellular Leishmania major amastigotes were killed by infected skin macrophages within 72 h upon stimulation with CpG-containing immunostimulatory <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. Parasite killing by macrophages was independent of endogenous interferon-γ production, but was strongly enhanced by exogenous interferon-γ.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether antisense Bcl- 2 <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> could enhance paclitaxel cytotoxicity and delay androgen-independent progression. Methods: Northern and western blot analyses were used to measure changes in Bcl- 2 expression in mouse Shionogi tumor cells after treatment with antisense Bcl- 2 <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> and/or paclitaxel. Growth inhibition and induction of apoptotic cell death were assessed with the use of standard methods. All P values are two-sided. Results: Treatment of Shionogi tumor cells with 500 nM antisense Bcl- 2 <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> decreased {{expression of}} Bcl- 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) by approximatel...|$|R
40|$|A new {{procedure}} for rapid deprotection of synthetic <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> has been developed. While all known deprotection methods require purification {{to remove the}} residual protective groups (e. g. benzamide) and insoluble silicates, the new procedure based {{on the use of}} an ammonia-free reagent mixture allows one to avoid the additional purification steps. The method can be applied to deprotect the <b>oligodeoxynucleotides</b> synthesized by using the standard protected nucleoside phosphoramidites dGiBu, dCBz and dABz...|$|R
