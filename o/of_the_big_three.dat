5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights on all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} in 1866 as a printer of {{standardized}} business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This {{was followed by a}} major down-sizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies.|$|E

50|$|The {{only major}} auto {{companies}} {{to survive the}} Great Depression were General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Corporation, Hudson Motor Car Company, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation, Packard Motor Car Company, Studebaker Corporation, and Crosley Motors. The former three companies, known as <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three,</b> enjoyed significant advantages over the smaller independent auto companies due to their financial strength, which gave them a big edge in marketing, production, and technological innovation. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three's</b> competitors ended production by the 1960s, and their last major domestic competitor was acquired in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By {{the end of that}} year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E

The previous three seasons the club was coached by Ronald Koeman; he announced his intention to leave the club in February 2014. During these three seasons Feyenoord finished second, third and second in the league, they got ousted from the cup twice in the quarter-finals and once in the third round. Their European campaigns were short-lived with five losses and one draw during these three years. A month after Koeman's announcement, Fred Rutten was presented as the new manager.|$|E
25|$|After the 2007–08 campaign, as PSG faced relegation {{until the}} very last matchday (eventually {{reaching}} safety at 16th), Pauleta retired from football after his last match on 17 May 2008, {{with the possible exception}} being if any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>three</b> (S.L.

He retired at 35 without having played one game in Portugal's Primeira Liga, subsequently staying at PSG but in an ambassadorial role; he remained the club's top scorer of all time with 109 goals in 211 matches, until the record was broken by Zlatan Ibrahimović in October 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{next decade}} brought the United States Football League (USFL), which played its {{season in the}} spring instead of autumn. After three seasons of play during which it never had {{the same number of}} teams and many franchises moved, it also filed an {{antitrust}} suit it had brought against the NFL. Seeking {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} and damages, USFL v. NFL centered around the NFL's television contracts, and in addition to the financial damages, it also sought to invalidate the league's contracts with at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks that dominated U.S. TV at the time. The jury concluded that the NFL was indeed violating antitrust laws but refused to tear up the broadcast contracts (noting that a last-ditch effort to move the league's season to autumn forced out numerous major market teams that would have made a television package more appealing) and only awarded a token $3 judgment in the USFL's favor. The failure to secure either objective in the lawsuit, coupled with mounting debts, prompted the USFL to cease operations.|$|E

25|$|However, {{with the}} {{announcement}} of the CBS affiliation's move to WTTV, the station announced plans to launch newscasts separate from those on WXIN with its own on-air staff (similar to, though also differing in structure from the shared news operation of St. Louis sister duopoly KTVI/KPLR-TV, the latter of which maintains separate anchors from KTVI for certain newscasts), which is housed out of the two stations' shared facility on Network Place. This makes WXIN/WTTV the first known duopoly (legal or virtual) involving a Big Three affiliate and a Fox station, in which the two stations maintain separate news departments and newscasts in competing timeslots (the presence of two separate, but jointly based news departments controlled by one company structured in this manner is more common with duopolies involving stations affiliated with two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> networks). There is a considerable amount of sharing between WTTV and WXIN in regards to news coverage, video footage and the use of reporters; though both outlets maintain their own primary on-air personalities (such as news anchors and meteorologists) that only appear on their respective station.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, {{the smaller}} American Motors Corporation (AMC) was formed when Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation {{in a deal}} worth almost USD $200 million ($ million in 2013 dollars) the largest {{corporate}} merger in U.S. history at that time.

500|$|Packard {{began the}} 1950s on a {{difficult}} note, as sales dropped from 116,248 in 1949 to an underwhelming 42,627 in 1950.

500|$|Studebaker {{had enjoyed}} earlier success {{and was the}} first {{independent}} automaker to produce an overhead valve V8 engine, a 232.6 cubic inch, 120hp unit, the first low-priced V8. [...] The company's peak year was 1950, when it produced and sold 329,884 units. Studebaker struggled {{during the first half of}} the decade. [...] The cars had styling ahead of their time but were overpriced when compared to the offerings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three.</b> Low sales and financial difficulties led to a merger with Packard in 1954, itself in financial trouble. [...] The new company, Studebaker-Packard Corporation, retired the Packard name in July 1958, but continued marketing automobiles under the Studebaker name until 1966.|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{initially}} {{offered the}} vacant position to Johnny Hutchinson <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three,</b> {{a group that}} Epstein later managed.

I couldn't do the dirty on him"— although Hutchinson did play for The Beatles at short notice when Best did not turn up on the evening of his dismissal and for two subsequent bookings, until Ringo Starr was able to join. Starr was well known to the group, as he was then playing with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, the resident group at Butlins' holiday complex in Skegness. He had also occasionally replaced Best when the drummer was ill, and had performed at a recording session with Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison in Hamburg.|$|E
500|$|Kaiser, Allstate, Frazer and the economy/compact Henry J {{product lines}} all ceased {{production}} {{before the end}} of the 1955 model year run, partly owing to their failure to produce and market a viable V8 engine in a marketplace increasingly focused on the clout (and horsepower) associated with a V8 power plant. In particular, the Henry J (named after Henry J Kaiser sold an initially strong 82,000 units with its 68hp, inline-four power plant and optional 80hp inline-six, but starting at $1363, the consumer could buy a full-sized Chevrolet auto with an inline-6 for only $200 more than the Henry J inline-4, making it economically unappealing, and all three lines underpowered when compared to the offerings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Three.</b> [...] The Allstate is an example of badge engineering, being a rebranded Henry J.
