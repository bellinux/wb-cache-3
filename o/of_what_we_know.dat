5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> {{about her and}} her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, {{some of which may}} have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Turtle was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, the Turtle has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” The Turtle remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E

25|$|Until the 19th century, most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about {{historical}} sign languages {{is limited}} to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself.

25|$|Ptolemy's {{comprehensive}} treatise {{of mathematical}} astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy.

25|$|While {{there is}} rich archaeological and {{linguistic}} evidence of earlier Germanic religious ideas, these sources are all mute, and cannot {{be interpreted with}} much confidence. Seen in light <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about the medieval survival of the Germanic religions as practiced by the Nordic nations, some educated guesses may be made. However, the presence of marked regional differences make generalization of any such reconstructed belief or practice a risky venture.|$|E

African music in Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly upbeat polyrhythmic and joyful, whereas the blues should be viewed as an aesthetic development resulting from the conditions of slavery in the new world.|$|E

25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> {{about the}} site {{is due to the}} large number of altars, {{dedication}} slabs and a milestone dedicated to emperor Gordian III found half a mile away from the fort on the path of Dere Street. Gods worshipped include traditional Roman deities such as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Silvanus and Celtic and Germanic ones such as Garmangabis. From such stones and building inscriptions we know who built the fort and eventually garrisoned it.|$|E
25|$|Plato was the {{innovator}} of {{the written}} dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato {{appears to have been}} the founder of Western political philosophy, with his Republic, and Laws among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about these figures today derives from Plato himself.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Olívio Dutra won the mayor’s seat in Porto Alegre.

25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about Rogers and {{his style}} in {{business}} dealings were recorded by others. His behavior in public Court Proceedings provide {{some of the}} better examples and some insight. Rogers' business style extended to his testimony in many court settings. Before the Hepburn Commission of 1878, investigating the railroads of New York, he fine-tuned his circumlocutory, ambiguous, and haughty responses. His most intractable performance was later in a 1906 lawsuit {{by the state of}} Missouri, which claimed that two companies in that state registered as independents were actually subsidiaries of Standard Oil, a secret ownership Rogers finally acknowledged.|$|E
25|$|The albedos of planets, {{satellites}} and minor planets such as asteroids {{can be used}} to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises {{a major part of the}} astronomical field of photometry. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about Pythagoras's life {{comes from}} Neoplatonist writers. These writers {{believed}} in the Greek gods, so many myths exist around Pythagoras. Myths about Pythagoras include: Apollo was his father, Pythagoras gleamed with a supernatural brightness, Pythagoras had a golden thigh, Abaris once flew to him on a golden arrow, and Pythagoras was seen in different places at the same time. According to Sir William Smith, {{with the exception of}} a few remarks by Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Isocrates, we are mainly dependent on Diogenes Laërtius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus for biographical details. Burkert (1972, p.109) states that Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus are the most important accounts.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in 2004, {{the year}} before his death, Lee {{explained}} that the design goal was [...] "to get as much ink on paper as possible in a given size with the maximum possible x-height" [...] {{and to provide a}} home-grown metal type alternative to European designs in the style, which were complicated for British businesses to license and use. Impact resembles other condensed designs of the period, such as Schmalfette Grotesk (and its successor Haettenschweiler) which is similarly designed, but narrower. Lee wrote that [...] "many of us admired the vitality and colour <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> only as Schmalfette, and used it by old-fashioned cut and paste.

25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about Columbanus {{is based}} on Columbanus' own works (as far {{as they have been}} preserved) and Jonas of Bobbio's Vita Columbani (Life of Columbanus), which was written between 639 and 641. Jonas entered Bobbio after Columbanus' death but relied on reports of monks who still knew Columbanus. A {{description}} of miracles of Columbanus written by an anonymous monk of Bobbio is of much later date. In the second volume of his Acta Sanctorum O.S.B., Mabillon gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> {{about the}} {{elemental}} composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments {{to measure the}} surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars {{in the form of}} meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves {{toward the back of the}} cell.|$|E
