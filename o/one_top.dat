25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first <b>one</b> (<b>top</b> left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second <b>one</b> (<b>top</b> right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient, even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E
