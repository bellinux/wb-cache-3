5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first years <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> it {{was returned to}} the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court,</b> Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership.

5|$|Like Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas {{was not a}} Catholic at {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Roman Catholic seminary, but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b> Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court,</b> and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Roman Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minton's time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> {{marked the}} end of a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E

Soon after Owsley's appointment, the legislature reduced the number of justices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> and Owsley resigned his seat. He was elected to the state House again in 1811. When a vacancy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals occurred in 1813, Governor Isaac Shelby re-appointed Owsley to the court.|$|E
5|$|Several justices {{have become}} widowers {{while on the}} bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice John Rutledge, contributed to the mental health {{problems}} {{that led to the}} rejection of his recess appointment. Roger B. Taney survived his wife, Anne, by twenty years. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. resolutely continued working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> for several years {{after the death of his}} wife.
