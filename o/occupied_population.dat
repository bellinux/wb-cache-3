50|$|When {{we look at}} the {{occupational}} structure we find that there was a very high percentage of dependents, i.e. women and children. But leaving aside dependents, domestic service was the largest occupational group. In both 1901 and 1911 it accounted for over 40% of the <b>occupied</b> <b>population.</b> This explains the large number of single people, as was seen earlier, and also the class structure. The domestic servants were usually employed by those in the next largest sector- the public and professional service. These were mainly army personnel living outside the barracks. This reflects the importance of the military to Ballincollig in those years.|$|E

This specifically included the definition of administrative regions, the demarcation of routes that secured connections between their <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> centers and their actions based on the changing policies of Rome. The first of these was accomplished, essentially, by the territorial definition of their civitates, the normal unit of Roman administration, which subordinated other rural sites to its political, administrative and judicial authority and imposed control.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For {{a proper}} {{understanding}} of the present evolution of the commerce with services {{we have to start}} from the Romanian tertiary sector analysis for the period 1990 – present time. The study analyses the evolution of the three sectors, mainly the tertiary sector considering some indicators and the dynamics of the Romanian services importation and exportation during 2003 – 2006. Till 1898 the increase of the percentage of <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> with services (from 14, 4 % to 27 %) was slower than in industry (from 15, 1 % to 38, 1 %) and the contribution of the services to the Gross National product increased in the same period from 13, 4 % to 26, 1 %. In this period the most important services were those for the population (natural persons) not for enterprises (legal persons), so that some support services for the modern society remained behind (telecommunications, transportation, bank services and insurances, etc.). After 1990 the situation became, as we can observe in table 1, more favorable for the tertiary sector (the services), the <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> in this sector reaching 37, 5 % in 2005.

As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|R
