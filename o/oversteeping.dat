50|$|Kukicha has a mildly nutty, and {{slightly}} creamy sweet flavour. It {{is made of}} four sorts of stems, stalks and twigs of Camellia sinensis. For best results, kukicha is steeped in water between 70 C to 80 C. Green varieties are best steeped for less than one minute (<b>oversteeping</b> or steeping too hot, as with all green teas, {{will result in a}} bitter, unsavoury brew).|$|E
50|$|Relative to theanine, the {{opposite}} (D-, R-) enantiomer is largely {{absent from the}} literature, except implicitly. While natural extracts that are not harshly treated are presumed to contain only the biosynthetic L- enantiomeric form, mishandled isolates and racemic chemical preparations of theanines necessarily contain both theanine and its D-enantiomer (and from racemic syntheses, in equal proportion), and {{studies have suggested that}} the D-isomer may actually predominate in some commercial supplement preparations. Amino acid racemization in aqueous media is a well-established chemical process promoted by elevated temperature and non-neutral pH values; prolonged heating of Camellia extracts—possible for <b>oversteeped</b> teas and in undisclosed commercial preparative processes—has been reported to result in increasing racemization of theanine to give increasing proportions of the nonnatural D-theanine, up to equal proportions of each enantiomer.|$|R
40|$|A {{steady state}} inverse global ocean model is used {{together}} with theavailable original, historical hydrographic database to study andquantify the large-scale global ocean circulation. The model has avariable resolution grid with grid sizes {{as small as}} 2. 5 by 2 latitude along boundaries, straits or <b>oversteep</b> topography and a default resolution of 5 by 4 in"quiet" open ocean regions. The model has 26 vertical levels with 60 m resolution near the surface. The adjoint method is applied to drivethe model to the hydrographic data and to optimize horizontal flows,air-sea heat fluxes, and mixing coefficients in an iterative way. Mass, heat, and salt budgets are satisfied exactly by the model. After assimilation, both simulated temperature and salinity fields arein good agreement with observations. Sensitivity experiments showthat different circulation patterns with varying relative importanceof intermediate water versus warm water transports and varying warmwater inflow from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic are consistentwith the hydrographic data. However, for all solutions we find thatthe water mass that dominates the compensation of North Atlantic DeepWater export is Antarctic Intermediate Water. The northward transportrates of intermediate water in the South Atlantic and South Pacific inour model solutions range between 10 and 15 Sv in each ocean and areconsiderably larger than previously published values...|$|R
