Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a sprag clutch is connected to just half of the clutch <b>friction</b> <b>plates,</b> allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining <b>friction</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

The need for a simple wear model exists to predict the lifetime of the clutch and to give an insight in the combined influence of the operational parameters such as pressure and speed. In this paper wear of paper-based friction material is investigated on a simplified SAE# 2 test-rig using only one <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> and one spacer plate.

50|$|A {{torque limiter}} is an {{automatic}} device that protects mechanical equipment, or its work, from damage by mechanical overload. A torque limiter may limit the torque by slipping (as in a <b>friction</b> <b>plate</b> slip-clutch), or uncouple the load entirely (as in a shear pin). The action of a torque limiter is especially useful to limit any damage due to crash stops and jams.|$|R

When {{electricity is}} applied to the coil of an electromagnet, the magnetic flux attracts the armature to the face of the brake. As it does so, it squeezes the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>friction</b> disks together. The hub is normally mounted on the shaft that is rotating. The brake housing is mounted solidly to the machine frame. As the disks are squeezed, torque is transmitted from the hub into the machine frame, stopping and holding the shaft.|$|R

50|$|Attached to the {{transaxle}} is a Power Transfer Unit (PTU), {{which is}} connected to a rear axle through a propeller shaft. The PTU also feeds torque through itself to the front axle. At the rear axle, torque was first sent through a viscous coupling before reaching the final drive gearset. This coupling contained <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> and an oil just viscous enough so that pressure affected how many plates were connected and active (and therefore, how much power was being delivered to the rear wheels).|$|R

50|$|The damping {{rate for}} {{frictional}} dampers {{has less than}} ideal behaviour for car suspension. An ideal suspension would offer more damping to greater suspension forces, with less damping at low speeds for a smoother ride. Frictional dampers though had a mostly constant rate. This was even greater when stationary, owing to stiction between stationary plates. For larger bumps the damping may even be reduced. This is particularly a problem for fast driving, when repeated high forces may cause the <b>friction</b> <b>plates</b> to heat up and lose their efficiency.|$|R

50|$|Also {{in case of}} an {{unstable}} operating point the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the operating point is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>friction</b> as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable operating point is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point.
