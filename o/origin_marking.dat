30|$|We {{began to}} pay {{attention}} to the issue of “country-of-origin” labelling when we noticed misinformation about the origin of the blend of extra virgin olive oil exported from Italy to China. In February 2011, the first author saw in several supermarkets in Guangzhou (China) olive oil bottles labelled in Chinese “Country-of-origin: Italy”, while the same oils in Italy were commonly known as “olio comunitario” or Community oil, that is, oil produced in the EU. The community oil produced in Italy is mainly a blend of oils originating from Spain and Greece. Then, we discussed the <b>origin</b> <b>marking</b> with four Italian suppliers of olive oil, of which two are bottling companies of Community oil and Italian oil and the other two are producers of Italian olive oil. Since the origin indication is complicated yet important when the Community oil bottled in Italy is exported to China, we decided to conduct our research on the country-of-origin labelling of food produced by two or more countries.|$|E
30|$|In this context, region means a {{group of}} {{countries}} and the experts state their viewpoints on the necessity of indicating the originating countries for foods produced in the European Union. We noticed a clear-cut divide here, since the American academics said “No” or “only voluntary”, while the Asian and European academics said “Yes” and made further comments. The government officials and the representatives of consumer associations said “Yes” or made positive considerations. The most interesting opinions can be summarised as follows: Although the statement of origin “European Union” is adequate for applying trade measures, for foods, their origin should be declared {{according to the law}} of importing country. Many countries do not accept the <b>origin</b> <b>marking</b> “European Union” and require the exact country of origin. Given that consumers in Europe note the differences among European countries and appreciate the origin labelling with country name, the indication of origin “European Union” is not very meaningful for consumers outside the EU. Moreover, a precise indication of origin will be useful for export promotion.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the misrepresentation of American beef in the British market between c. 1890 and c. 1913. We examine the complaints voiced by British consumers, producers, and retailers and we discuss {{the response of the}} British government and the United States Department of Agriculture. A new dataset is employed to calculate the price premiums that could be earned from the misrepresentation of beef according to geographic origin. While considerable premiums could be earned by "passing-off" American beef as British in the 1890 s, these premiums declined during the 1900 s. Particular emphasis is placed on the inability of the British government to act unilaterally on meat marking. This article also considers origin as a means of distinguishing between categories of nonbranded goods. Yet "origin" has many dimensions. Not only does it indicate provenance, it sometimes signals quality associated with provenance while also serving as the basis for protectionist responses.

40|$|Combining Electric Bikes (E-bikes) with bicycle sharing {{systems could}} {{have a number of}} benefits. E-bikes reduce the human force needed for {{propulsion}} which facilitates longer and hillier rides relative regular bikes. The system could thus have more widespread network of stations, not only reaching more people but also enable commuting longer distances. It could also reduce the need for redistribution as users of regular bike sharing systems tend to only ride downhill. The focus of this report has been to perform energy calculations and system design on solar powered E-bike pools. The geographical focus has been on Gothenburg, Sweden but the results can be applied to locations with similar latitude. The calculation methodology may however be applied to any other city around the world. It was shown that placing 0. 2 - 0. 8 m 2 solar panels per E-bike on the station's roof could supply enough energy to make the E-bike self-sufficient on a yearly basis despite high degree of system use. By increasing the solar panel area it was shown that there can be a net electric energy production on a yearly basis. At the maximum assumed solar panel area (about 3 - 3. 8 m 2 /E-bike) there could be 600 - 800 kWh of solar energy fed to the grid per E-bike and year depending on the usage level. Using a system that is on-grid and coupled with a stationary battery is seen as the best system design. That would enable <b>origin</b> <b>marking</b> of electricity and decrease the problem of intermittency with solar power. Reducing the interchange with the grid would also increase the system efficiency as the current {{do not need to be}} converted to or from AC as often...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the effect of {{regulatory}} burdens in the European dairy industry on its competitiveness. A theoretical foundation is provided by transaction cost economics and total quality management insights. The effects of legislation on administrative requirements and competitiveness are supposed to be mediated by impacts on innovativeness, company strategy, food safety system availability, as well as the available information & communication capabilities. We will connect to previous research (Wijnands et al., 2007) and the findings therein. Four sub-questions are addressed: • what is the relationship between administrative burdens, innovation and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative burdens, food safety & quality system deployment and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative burdens, food labelling requirements and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative burdens, supply chain transparency and competitiveness? In addition to the theoretical framework presented earlier in Bremmers et al., 2008, this paper contains the first results of a survey in the European dairy industry. They are combined with the proceeds from a literature search. The results show that (Q 1) especially product innovation is negatively impacted by administrative burdens. Food safety and quality systems (Q 2) serve to provide a level playing field in Europe. They would be installed also if no legal requirements would enforce them, because clients ask for it, so that administrative burdens could easily be attributed to business strategy rather than legal obligations. To reduce administrative burdens, we advice to integrate food safety and quality requirements is necessary. It would reduce monitoring and reporting costs, both for private as well as public parties. Food labeling (Q 3) (a ‘made in Europe’ <b>origin</b> <b>marking)</b> could work contraproductive with respect to the competitive position of dairy firms and will have an increase of administrative burdens as a net-effect. And last but not least (Q 4), increased chain transparency (mentioning the name of intermediary producers on the end-product package) will accelerate administrative burdens, but will only be beneficial for SMEs with a differentiated product. Commodity-producers in the dairy industry which only follow a cost strategy will gradually merge and/or disappear. dairy industry, competitiveness, administrative burdens, food safety, labelling, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|The {{incentive}} {{to investigate the}} origin of meat products and their related consumer atti-tudes have {{shown to be a}} serious and debated topic especially after receiving a lot of focus in media. The specific origin discussed in this thesis lies within the suggestion of introducing an EU <b>origin</b> <b>marking</b> or what also can be referred to as “Made in EU” labelling. During the investigation of whether this creates a negative or positive attitude many factors are needed to be considered. The nationalistic feelings that still exist within the member states {{is one of the major}} obstacles but also information and consumer awareness concerning what EU stand for. The focus is on Swedish consumers’ perspective and the effects of implementing “Made in EU” are considered solely on the Swedish market. The theoretical framework is constructed around the central concept of country of origin (COO) that can be noted as of key relevance when investigating consumer behaviour. An analysis model is also introduced to give a deeper understanding of the connections between findings and the theoretical concepts. The fundamental methodology that was cho-sen in order to investigate these attitudes was found to be through the use of focus groups. These were carried out in combination with a secondary data analysis for the clarification of knowledge concerning the topic. What results shown from this study and the connected conclusions can be summarised in a few lines. First, Swedish consumers had generally a negative attitude towards introducing this label. The reason was that the consumers on one hand could not associate the origin as EU at the same time as Swedish consumers prefer to buy Swedish meat which is related to the Swedish model. Secondly, the factors brought forward that were influencing the COO shows what the attitude consist of, for instance stereotypes and perception. Thirdly, this research has managed to bring together new findings, previous COO studies with theoretical concepts and thereby created knowledge about Swedish ethnocentrism and cultural and economical aspects the Swedish consumers use when evaluating meat. Finally, the research method and theoretical concepts can be applied to other areas such as different products or countries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its <b>origin,</b> <b>marking</b> and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative log marking method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log code printer and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both log code marking and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each code mark is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The marking technology is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 logs was marked and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|E
