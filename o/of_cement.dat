40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay are studied. The theoretical {{framework of the}} Structured Cam Clay (SCC) model is extended to describe the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay. The SCC model is modified {{to take into account}} special features of the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay. The widely used mean effective stress parameter is modified to include the influence of cementation on the strength and the plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay. A new destructuring function is also suggested to represent the removal of the cementation structure, especially {{in the formation of the}} final failure state for artificially strongly cemented clay. The revised model is then employed to simulate and predict the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay with various degrees of cementation and confining stresses. The main features of the complicated behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> clay can be reasonably represented well by the theoretical framework of the SCC model. Finally, the influence of cementation on the model parameters is discussed, and empirical equations are proposed to determine some of the key model parameters for engineering practice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} prevent the {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> <b>cementing</b> fluid leakage in low leakiness formation and protecting reservoir effectively, low density cement system is widely used. As the use of lightening admixture to reduce the density in low density cement system, the <b>cement</b> acoustic impedance <b>of</b> low density <b>cement</b> system is different from conventional density, it can not reflect the real cementing quality when using the criteria <b>of</b> conventional density <b>cement</b> cementing quality evaluation to evaluate the <b>cement</b> job quality <b>of</b> low density <b>cement.</b> Targeted at this problem, this paper conducted a method to improve the criteria <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>cementing</b> for low density cement. Studies have shown that the compressive strength and the acoustic impedance has a good linear relationship in different types <b>of</b> low density <b>cement</b> conserved 24 h and 48 h, so we put forward a method to improve the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>cementing</b> quality <b>of</b> low density <b>cement</b> based on the compressive strength <b>of</b> low density <b>cement...</b>|$|R

5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection <b>of</b> <b>cement,</b> recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a water-tight shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use <b>of</b> <b>cement</b> injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after {{a meeting on}} 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Working fluid is {{commonly}} used in the making and using progress <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide tool. The tungsten carbide leaching <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide tool will be resulted in by the sodium carbonate in cutting fluid, because of the tungsten carbide will occur oxidative dissolution. The inhibitor that suppress tungsten carbide leaching <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide tool is investigated by soaking experiments, friction experiments, SEM analysis, and energy spectrum analysis. The test result shows that aqueous solution and sodium carbonate will cause tungsten carbide leaching through oxidative dissolution; but compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole could suppress tungsten carbide leaching. The Inhibition mechanism is that compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole could generate complete and compact protective film on the surface <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> carbide tool, therefore, tungsten carbide leaching is inhibited. Add compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole to the water-based cutting fluid could suppress tungsten carbide leaching effectively...|$|R

In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands {{is examined}} experimentally and theoretically in this study. The first {{segment of the}} investigation involves an extensive laboratory program {{to examine the effects}} of slenderness ratio, effects of cementation, and effects of confining pressure on the stress-strain curves <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands. Results show that specimens with slenderness ratio of 1. 5 or greater exhibit lower strength, higher dilatation rates, and relatively brittle behavior when compared to samples with slenderness ratio <b>of</b> 1. Furthermore, <b>cemented</b> sands have an essentially straight line Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope, whose cohesion intercept increases with the degree of cementation of the soil. The effective friction angles measured for cemented sands with various cementation levels are in the same ranges as the effective friction angle evaluated for uncemented sands. Moreover, failure modes of the material varies from brittle to ductile depending upon the level of cementation and the degree of confinement. In general, as cementation increases, cemented sand exhibits a brittle failure behavior; while increasing the confining pressure causes a ductile failure response. The second portion of the project includes development of a constitutive model for cemented sands. Cemented sand is viewed as a multi-phase material comprising three phases: sand, cement, and pore water. The elastoplastic behavior <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands is the consequence of the behavior of the individual phases plus the interaction of the phases. The individual phases (sand and cement) are modeled using the theory of plasticity. Mixtures theory is used to assemble the individual phases to simulate the overall behavior <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands. The gradual damage of the internal structure <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands is also incorporated within the model. The agreement between experimental data and model predictions is very good. In summary, mixtures theory using simple plasticity models for the individual phases is capable of capturing the complex behavior <b>of</b> <b>cemented</b> sands...|$|R
