25|$|The 9/11 Commission Report {{noted that}} lack of {{preparedness}} could {{have led to the}} deaths of first responders {{at the scene of the}} attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years. The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an effort to save lives. Giuliani testified to the Commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33 million no-bid contract with Motorola, and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter's calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old analog radios from 1993. A book later published by Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission, argued that the Commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with Giuliani.|$|E

500|$|The 1990s saw {{considerable}} {{progress in}} plant phylogenetics and cladistic theory, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for the flowering plants. The establishment of major new clades necessitated {{a departure from}} the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne, based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. These developments complicated discussions on plant evolution and necessitated a major taxonomic restructuring. rbcL gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots in 1995 had redefined the Liliales <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four original morphological orders sensu Dahlgren. The largest clade within this redefined Liliales, christened the [...] "core Liliales" [...] representing a now much reduced Liliaceae, had all previously been included in the Liliales, and included three taxonomic groups: (i) Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren, but also both the (ii) Calochortaceae as defined by Minoro Tamura (sensu Tamura) and (iii) Clintonia-Medeola which had been included in Liliaceae sensu Tamura (see Table 3).|$|E

As the strike dragged on into its third week, coal supplies were running low and public sentiment was calling for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came on December 10. Palmer's tough stand won him considerable praise from business and professional groups. He received one letter that said: [...] "A lion-hearted man, {{with a great}} nation behind him, has brought <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> chaos. You have shown...that the United States is not a myth, but a virile, mighty power which shows itself when a [...] man who measures up to {{the duties of the}} hour is at the helm."

The I Ching, an ancient Chinese classic text on changing events, became Cage's standard composition tool {{for the rest of his}} life. In a 1957 lecture, Experimental Music, he described music as [...] "a purposeless play" [...] which is [...] "an affirmation of life – not an attempt to bring <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living".|$|E

[...] Then he'll get excited, and dressed though he is in top form, will rush right into a scrimmage and show 'em how it should be done, no matter how muddy the field. [...] Practice over, Tom will go back to the Taft and order another suit. [...] He seems to have a new suit of clothes every day."In November 1915, Shevlin led Yale to a 13-7 win over Princeton in front of 50,000 fans at New Haven—the largest crowd ever to view a Yale-Princeton game. [...] After the game, Shevlin was haled as [...] "the miracle man of football" [...] who had [...] "saved Yale from the worst gridiorn defeat in her history." [...] Shevlin had been called east in October 1915 and was credited with having [...] "made <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> chaos" [...] in just two weeks training the Yale team.|$|E
2500|$|Caird's {{writings}} often {{stress the}} integration of theology and politics. Long before it was in vogue, he felt the urgency of including politics in any responsible theological dialogue. This is identifiable early on in Principalities and Powers; there, he repeatedly urged, the unusual phrase meant for Paul his unique take on the political, social, economic and religious power structures of this world. And, as in {{his work on the}} historical Jesus, the importance of political concerns in Christianity remains central in his taking on of such varied topics as the modern Christian attitude to war ("War and the Christian"), the status of women in society ("Paul and Women's Liberty"), and Apartheid. With regard to the last, his addresses to the South African Dutch Reformed Church (during his tenure in 1975-1976 as Moderator of the United Reformed Church) were later distilled and published as South Africa: Reflections on a Visit. A clarion call for the modern Christian Church's renunciation of racism, it demonstrated that for Caird the gospel, while profoundly religious, is not uniquely religious; it penetrates to all areas of personal and collective human activity. His work as a humanitarian and churchman is perhaps best reflected in Our Dialogue with Rome: The Second Vatican Council and After, which his close friend Henry Chadwick called [...] "a memorable little book" [...] that attempts to bring some <b>order</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the morass of Protestant-Roman Catholic dialogue, [...] "with its unexpected moments of sudden joy and usually more numerous tears".|$|E
