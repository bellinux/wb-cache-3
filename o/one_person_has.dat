5|$|Though the Binnewater rail {{station was}} {{once part of}} the {{historic}} district, it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May 1989. The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department. Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers. The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, {{and at least one}} wedding. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> tried bungee jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord.|$|E

The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people may enjoy it. Balinese gamelan cannot be heard inside closed rooms, because it easily crosses the threshold of pain. This does not apply to small ensembles like a gamelan gendér.|$|E

One of her students published an article in a 1937 Library Journal sharing these ideas. [...] “Reviewing Mudge’s career at Columbia, Constance Mabel Winchell, Mudge’s protégé, said: ‘Probably no other <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> contributed so much to the raising the standards of reference collections and reference services in the libraries of this and other countries.’" ...|$|E

Moreover, it will be subjected to another layer of interpretation and subjectivity when read and learned by others. This kind of knowledge (or [...] "book learning"), like desire, should be diminished. [...] "It was when intelligence and knowledge appeared that the Great Artifice began." [...] (chap. 18, tr.

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} death and {{observance}} of Yom Kippur with penitence atone for sin. Penitence atones for lighter sins, while for severer sins, penitence suspends God's punishment, until Yom Kippur comes to atone. The Mishnah taught that no opportunity for penance {{will be given}} to one who says: [...] "I shall sin and repent, sin and repent." [...] And Yom Kippur does not atone for one who says: [...] "I shall sin and Yom Kippur will atone for me." [...] Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah derived from the words [...] "From all your sins before the Lord shall you be clean" [...] in [...] that Yom Kippur atones for sins against God, but Yom Kippur does not atone for transgressions between one person and another, until the <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> pacified the other.

2500|$|A {{resulting}} trust is usually recognised when <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> given property {{to another person}} without the intention to benefit them. The recipient will be declared by the court to be a [...] "{{resulting trust}}ee" [...] so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the courts of equity required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily {{as a way to}} prevent fraud. If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that {{it was meant to be}} a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the transferee. It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the transferee would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a resulting trust. On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe, an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson. When she died, the executor, Mr Fowkes, argued that Mr Pascoe held the stocks on resulting trust for the estate, but the Court of Appeal said the fact that the lady had put the stocks in Mr Pascoe's name was absolutely conclusive. The presumption of a resulting trust was rebutted.|$|E
