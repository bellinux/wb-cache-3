5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} reservation time <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> sirloin meat <b>of</b> local bull in room temperature. Smples used were sirloin meat from six male local bulls, aged 3 - 4 years old, {{all of which were}} slaughtered at slaughter house of Banda Aceh municipality. They were designed into two treatments, 3 cm 3  Cutting and crushing sirloin meats. Meat docay time was determined by using postma test every 3 hours after the treatment. The results showed that: 1) two samples of 3 cm cutting sirloin meats were dubius at 9 hours, and one sample was dubius at 12 hours, 2) four samples <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> sirloin meats showed dubius at 6 hours, 3) mean decay 3 time cm 3   cutting sirloin meats was 11 ± 1. 55 hours and that <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> sirloin meats was 6. 5 ± 1. 22 hours, 4) the test showed that decay time of 3  cm 3  cutting sirloin meats was significantly longer than that <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> sirloin meats (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The energy-absorption {{capability}} as {{a function}} <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> speed was determined for Thornel 300 -Fiberite 934 (Gr-E) and Kevlar- 49 -Fiberite 934 (K-E) composite material. Circular cross section tube specimens were crushed at speeds ranging from 0. 01 to 12 m/sec. Ply orientations of the tube specimens were (0 / +/- theta) 2 and (+/- theta) 2 where theta = 15, 45, and 75 deg. Based upon {{the results of these}} tests, the energy-absorption capability of Gr-E and K-E was determined to be a function <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> speed. The magnitude of the effects <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> speed on energy-absorption capability was determined to be a function of the mechanisms that control the crushing process. The effects <b>of</b> <b>crushing</b> speed on the energy-absorption capability is related to whether the mechanical response <b>of</b> the <b>crushing</b> mechanism that controls the crushing process is a function of strain rate. Energy-absorption capability of Gr-E and K-E tubes ranged between 0 and 35 percent and 20 and 45 percent, respectively, depending upon ply orientation...|$|R

25|$|PAC {{material}} is finer material. PAC {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>crushed</b> or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters.|$|E

More reliability and higher production {{have been added to}} basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation.

25|$|Sorbic acid is a {{winemaking}} additive used {{often in}} sweet wines as a preservative against fungi, bacteria and yeast growth.

Most humans have a detection threshold of 135mg/l, with some having a sensitivity to detect its presence at 50mg/l. Sorbic acid can produce off flavors and aromas which can be described as “rancid”.
