5|$|Rowson cites as {{an example}} of the last {{phenomenon}} the well-regarded Zaitsev Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.|$|E

Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it from his hands and puts it <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grin.|$|E

5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Erie Railroad {{continued}} <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new {{station at}} Harriman, which remained prosperous {{for years to}} come. In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident of Pine Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in the leg, which was crippling enough that it required amputation of the leg. His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated for five hours before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money.|$|E

5|$|Friday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups that lasted 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and Am were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All vehicles were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The qualifying session took place in sunny weather conditions. Porsche led the time sheets early <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flying lap from Hartley in the No. 1 entry before Bernhard improved it to clinch the team's first pole position of the season with an average time of one minute and 55.793 seconds. This was Hartley's, Bernhard's and Webber's seventh of their careers, and the 13th for the German manufacturer. They were joined on the grid's front row by team-mates Jani and Lieb who were nearly eight-tenths of a second off Bernhard and Hartley's pace but it marked the first occasion that Porsche began an World Endurance Championship in the first two starting positions since the 2015 6 Hours of Bahrain. Lieb was not happy with his fastest lap because he braked early and was unable to achieve a rhythm he liked.|$|E
5|$|I Anzac Corps was {{committed}} {{six weeks after}} the start of the battle and on 16 September, having marched through Ypres the night before, the 1st and 2nd Divisions took up a position in the trenches on the main ridge at Glencorse Wood. The first attack came on 20 September at Menin Road, where the Australians experienced success making considerable gains against the enemy for the loss of about 5,000 casualties. On 26 September, the 4th and 5th Divisions attacked and captured Polygon Wood, while later on 4 October, another successful attack was made on the main ridge at Broodseinde, where the four Australian divisions involved fought side by side, as they clashed head <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> German counterattack that had been launched {{at the same time the}} Australians had risen to carry out their assault. The result was a rout by the Australians, as the German line broke and following further attacks against German pillboxes, the ridge was captured.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E

5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered {{as a result of the}} dispute.|$|E
5|$|RB Leipzig faced Sevilla in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; the German side were without striker Timo Werner, but manager Ralph Hasenhüttl named new signing Jean-Kevin Augustin in his first eleven. Midfielder Emil Forsberg forced Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico into action early <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shot, but the ball was comfortably held on to. RB Leipzig {{continued}} to create chances and in the 18th minute a ball played over the Sevilla defence found Augustin. The forward's volley however flew over the goal and into the stand. Sevilla's first meaningful attack just after the half-hour mark resulted in a penalty. Bernardo's challenge on Walter Montoya in the penalty area was adjudged as a foul, despite video replays showing the defender managed to take the ball off the Sevilla midfielder. Wissam Ben Yedder stepped up to take the penalty and duly converted to give Sevilla the lead. The scoreline remained 1–0, despite both clubs' best efforts to score.|$|E
5|$|The Gallery {{was located}} in the Palais Leuchtenberg, {{the house of the}} Leuchtenberg family in Munich, built by Leo von Klenze between 1817 and 1821. It was opened to the public from at least 1837 on. The {{collection}} was catalogued in French and German from 1825 <b>on,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new version in German from 1841 on, and in an illustrated catalogue in English in 1852. After the death of Duke Maximilian in 1852, the Gallery was closed, the collection divided between his children, and the Palace sold to Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. Part of the collection was transferred to Saint Petersburg in 1854, where it was displayed in the Mariinsky Palace, and from 1870 on was lent to the Imperial Academy of Arts. The remainder moved together with Eugen Maximilianovich, Duke of Leuchtenberg, from Munich to Saint Petersburg in 1863. While the collection was still growing in the 1860s with purchases by Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, {{by the end of the}} century, some works were being sold off. The majority of the collection remained together until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when it was dispersed and a number of paintings sold in Sweden. Many works were acquired by the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum, with others ending up in museums all over the world. For example, Parmigianino's Circumcision of Jesus is now housed at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The remaining works are either lost or in private collections.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies scored {{first for}} the second game {{in a row in}} the second inning; Raúl Ibañez hit a ground rule double, and a Matt Stairs single off of A. J. Burnett drove him in. It was the only run allowed by the New York {{pitching}} staff. Mark Teixeira tied the game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another, giving the Yankees their first lead. Chan Ho Park allowed an RBI single to Jorge Posada after Martínez put two baserunners on {{in the top of the}} seventh. Burnett departed after seven innings, replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies put two runners <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base that drew controversy. Rivera completed the ninth inning for his 38th postseason save.|$|E
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake. Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons. He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed {{the fact that they had}} just crossed. Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} club surpassed {{the achievements of}} the previous season, finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, this time facing Birmingham City. Conscious that early nerves had affected his team in 1955, in the dressing room he focussed on instilling each member of his team with confidence. This time it was Manchester City who scored an early goal, and with City leading in the second half Paul told his men to keep the ball in play as much as possible in order to tire out the Birmingham players. Then German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann badly hurt his neck in a collision with Peter Murphy. Paul instructed Roy Little to take Trautmann's place, but Trautmann insisted that he would keep playing. Then Manchester City held on for the victory, and Paul collected the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II. X-rays later revealed that Trautmann had played <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken neck. Paul took the match ball from the final as a souvenir, and gave it to his son.|$|E

5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E
5|$|When Carmel {{is killed}} in a train crash, Mercedes clashes with Theresa and blames her for having ruined Carmel's life while she was alive. Mercedes tells her family to choose between her and Theresa, and when they side with Theresa, Mercedes moves out.
