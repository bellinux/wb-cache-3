25|$|During {{his time}} with CAIR, Bedier spoke out for Muslim rights {{not only in the}} United States, but also on a {{worldwide}} scale. This has sparked some criticism, backlash and threats.

25|$|A {{classified}} document by EU delegates, obtained by Ynet, suggested funding Palestinian construction projects in Area C of the West Bank without Israel's cooperation, undermining Israeli control. Under the Oslo Accords, Area C is under full Israeli civil and security control. It contains all of Israel's West Bank settlements {{and a small}} Palestinian population. The document expressed concern that Israel's policies would undermine the prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> on the 1967 borders, and called on Israel to support Palestinian construction across Area C and in East Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Based on the Israeli {{definition}} of the West Bank, Barak offered to form a Palestinian state initially on 73% of the West Bank (that is, 27% less than the Green Line borders) and 100% of the Gaza Strip. In 10–25 years, the Palestinian state would expand {{to a maximum of}} 92% of the West Bank (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap). From the Palestinian perspective this equated to an offer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> on a maximum of 86% of the West Bank.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{factor that}} has led to the {{movement}} is the Arab Spring.

25|$|Meretz {{remains the}} most vocal party within the Israeli peace camp. Leader Zehava Gal-On said that any {{solution}} {{must be based on}} two states for two peoples, with a border based on pre-1967 lines with agreed-upon land swaps, and include an end to the conflict through a regional solution hinged on the Arab Peace Plan. The party sees UN recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> as a pathway toward negotiations, and calls for the following immediate steps to be taken: Stopping settlement construction, paying Israeli residents of the West Bank to leave willingly and removing the naval blockade on the Gaza Strip in a gradual and coordinated way.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the severe}} {{economic}} and security situation in Israel, the Likud Party headed by Ariel Sharon won the Israeli elections in January 2003 in an overwhelming victory.

Following the endorsing of the Road Map, the Quartet on the Middle East was established, consisting of representatives from the United States, Russia, EU and UN as an intermediary body of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
25|$|Consulted by {{a senior}} {{figure of the}} PLO during the siege of Beirut, he set forth five {{political}} principles that would prove conducive to securing the PLO's political battle on a firmer footing. (1) Abandon Beirut (2) {{put an end to}} terrorism (3) relocate in Tunis, the only area where the Palestinian leadership could enjoy real political liberty (4) set up a provisory government, which would immediately be recognized by at least 150 countries (5) recognize Israel. If these measures were taken, Goldmann advised, the PLO would establish the basis for the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state,</b> alongside that of Israel. Goldmann's vision was to make Israel the spiritual and moral center for all Jews, a neutral state, and somewhat on the model of Switzerland, with international guarantees of its security, existence and borders, and perhaps even a permanent symbolic international presence.|$|E

25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E
25|$|The Palestinian Government {{was entirely}} {{relocated}} to Cairo in late October 1948 {{and became a}} government-in-exile, gradually losing any importance. Having {{a part in the}} All-Palestine Government, al-Husseini also remained in exile at Heliopolis in Egypt throughout much of the 1950s. As before 1948, when the Yishuv believed the ex-Mufti's hand could be detected 'behind every anti-Jewish pogrom, murder, and act of sabotage', Israel persisted in asserting that al-Husseini was behind many border raids from Jordanian and Egyptian-held territory, and Egypt expressed a readiness to deport him if evidence were forthcoming to substantiate the charges. The All-Palestine Government was eventually dissolved in 1959 by Nasser himself, who envisaged a United Arab Republic embracing Syria, Egypt and Palestine. That year he moved to Lebanon. He refused requests to lend his support to the emergent PLO after the Six Day War of 1967, was opposed to the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> on the west Bank after 1967. and his closest collaborator, Emil Ghuri, continued to work for the Jordanian monarchy even after the Jordanian Civil War there in 1970.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in January 1968, Nasser {{commenced}} the War of Attrition {{to reclaim}} territory captured by Israel, ordering attacks against Israeli positions {{east of the}} then-blockaded Suez Canal. In March, Nasser offered Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement arms and funds after their performance against Israeli forces in the Battle of Karameh that month. He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>state</b> comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nasser effectively ceded his leadership of the [...] "Palestine issue" [...] to Arafat.|$|E
