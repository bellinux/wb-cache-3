5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict {{about whether or not}} a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} occurred among US naval planners in {{the early}} years of the 20th century <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> have technically superior ships or many less expensive ones, with President Theodore Roosevelt among those supporting the former and Admiral of the Navy George Dewey along with Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan supporting the latter approach.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} this species as Lynx rufus or Felis rufus {{as part of}} a wider issue regarding whether the four species of Lynx should be given their own genus, or be placed as a subgenus of Felis. The Lynx genus is now accepted, and the bobcat is listed as Lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design because it would have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees {{to avoid the}} draft. The ACLU board was deeply split <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> place {{the station to}} the east or west of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was {{formally}} opened during a large ceremony on December20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily.|$|E
50|$|While Christian libertarians {{disagree}} <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> and <b>to</b> {{what extent}} {{agents of the}} state possess the moral authority {{to intervene in the}} lives of citizens, government involvement is generally viewed with skepticism and suspicion. As with the Christian left, war and nation-building are common targets of ethical scrutiny from Christians espousing the libertarian philosophy.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Betty is mugged in 1982 by Raymond Attwood (Joe Searby) from Ken Barlow's (William Roache) youth club; she {{ends up in}} {{hospital}} with a broken arm. This leads to a reunion with Ted, the man who fathered Gordon, though he is unaware of his son's existence. Ted visits Betty {{in hospital}} after reading about her mugging in a newspaper. Betty agonises <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> tell Ted about Gordon, but decides against it, preferring not to stir up the past.|$|E

50|$|Some {{have urged}} the foreign aid {{community}} to revise aggressive campaigns to assure rights for Afghan women {{in education and}} employment. The Afghan community is already sharply divided <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> assistance <b>to</b> boys' education should be discontinued {{because there is a}} ban on education for girls. Family harmony must be undermined when women are favored over men in a declining job market.|$|R
5|$|Corder {{spent the}} next three days in prison agonising <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> confess to the crime and make a clean breast of his sins before God. He finally confessed after several {{meetings}} with the prison chaplain, entreaties from his wife, and pleas from both his warder and John Orridge, the governor of the prison. He strongly denied stabbing Maria, claiming that he had accidentally shot her in the eye after they argued while she was changing out of her disguise.|$|E
5|$|During April 2011 {{internal}} deliberations of the president's innermost {{circle of}} advisors <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> order U.S. special forces {{to conduct a}} raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton {{was among those who}} argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role in}} the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).|$|E
5|$|Lorian, after {{considering}} {{his knowledge of}} events, believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether. Archer and Lorian then disagree <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> implement an engine modification to Enterprise, since there is a 22% chance it may cause {{the destruction of the}} ship. Archer then meets with old T'Pol on board old Enterprise, and considers a plan where his ship could pass through it safely, due to alternate modifications suggested by her. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma injectors from Enterprise to allow them to confront the Xindi in the place of their ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, {{whom he met}} as a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but he enjoyed the script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike The Wizard of Oz, which he would not bother remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the delay was the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1920, the Labor Party Premier, James Dooley, and {{his cabinet}} {{resigned}} after having lost {{a vote in}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a week before. The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Sir George Fuller, as Premier. As Fuller did not have a majority, he initiated attempts to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The Progressives split <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> join the Fuller government into an urban wing, led by Leader Walter Wearne and Deputy Leader Thomas Bavin, which agreed to enter Fuller's coalition and a rural wing ("The True Blues"), led by Bruxner and Ernest Buttenshaw who offered Fuller only conditional support. After seven hours in government, still without a workable majority, Fuller requested a double-dissolution from Davidson. Davidson refused, on the basis that Dooley still had a majority in the lower house, and Fuller resigned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the world}} of Therum, Shepard rescues Benezia's {{daughter}} Liara T'Soni, who joins Shepard's squad because of her biotic abilities and expertise of the Protheans. On the colony of Feros, Shepard fights off Saren's forces and learns that his flagship, Sovereign, possesses unique mind-control capabilities. On {{the world of}} Noveria, Shepard tracks down and defeats Benezia, who reveals that she and Saren are being indoctrinated by Sovereign. After completing these missions, the Council informs Shepard that a salarian infiltration unit has uncovered Saren's main base on Virmire. Upon arrival, Shepard learns that Saren has discovered a cure for the krogan genetic disease, the genophage, and plans to breed an army of unstoppable krogan warriors. Wrex clashes with Shepard <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> destroy it, which results in him either standing down or being executed. After this conflict, Shepard assists the salarians in destroying the base by planting a bomb in it. Inside, Shepard is confronted by Sovereign, who reveals itself to be an actual Reaper.|$|E
