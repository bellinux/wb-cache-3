50|$|Mountain Spring was {{the water}} source of stages and freight wagons {{on the old}} road between San Diego and Yuma, Arizona from 1863. It was located midway between the section of road <b>over</b> <b>Table</b> Mountain and the section of that road where it climbed up Devils Canyon out of the Yuha Desert.

Matchroom Sport's John McDonald alerted venue staff and only his quick thinking saved the table as he and cameraman Lawrence 'Lol' Lustig covered it to stop debris and foam raining down onto the felt.

5000|$|The total {{distance}} is about 80 km, {{which is more}} or less the shortest possible route through the Table Mountain National Park with the best running tracks and views.

[...] The 2015 event followed a slightly longer route to avoid fire damaged areas of the Table Mountain National Park and the Tuffer PUFfer (see below) was not held.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{supporting}} a large number of select-join subscriptions for wide-area publish/subscribe. Subscriptions are joins over different tables, with varying interests expressed as range selection conditions <b>over</b> <b>table</b> attributes. Naive schemes, such as computing and sending join results from a server, are inefficient because they produce redundant data, and are unable to share dissemination costs across subscribers and events. We propose a novel, scalable scheme that group-processes and disseminates a general mix of multi-way select-join subscriptions. We also propose a simple and application-agnostic extension tocontent-drivennetworks (CN), which further improves sharing of dissemination costs. Experimental evaluations show that our schemes can generate orders of magnitude lower network traffic at very low processing cost. Our extension to CN can further reduce traffic by another order of magnitude, with almost no increase in notification latency. ...|$|E

Between October 1985 and July 1990, the exponential column increase rate was (6. 7 +/- 0. 5) %/yr. Additionally, column measurements of CHF 2 Cl over McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (78 deg S) in September and October 1986 by the MarkIV FTIR spectrometer {{were used to}} derive a south-north interhemispheric ratio of (0. 86 +/- 0. 08). Model calculations investigated the feasibility of using CHF 2 Cl column measurements with a predicted global OH field to determine a globally averaged chemical lifetime for CHF 2 Cl, or equivalently, {{an estimate of the}} OH field using a predicted lifetime. The current uncertainty in historical CHF 2 Cl emissions is too large for CHF 2 Cl to be used to infer adequately either the lifetime or the OH field...|$|E
