Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E

25|$|The SASO {{consists}} of 12 questions. Six {{of these questions}} assess sexual attraction, four assess sexual behavior, and two assess sexual orientation identity. For each question on the scale that measures homosexuality there is a corresponding question that measures heterosexuality giving six matching pairs of questions. Taken all together, the six pairs <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> responses provide a profile of an individual's sexual orientation. However, results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality.|$|E
25|$|The House was {{supposed}} to break for the summer Thursday June 23, but remained open in an extended session due to the filibuster. The 103 NDP MPs had been taking it in turn to deliver 20 minute speeches – plus 10 minutes <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> comments – in order to delay {{the passing of the}} bill. MPs are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place, and many votes were needed before the bill could be passed. As the Conservative Party of Canada held a majority in the House, the bill passed. This was the longest filibuster since the 1999 Reform Party of Canada filibuster, on native treaty issues in British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} ceremony the candidate, often a ploughboy, {{was told to}} come to the barn where the ceremonial procedures were to take place, normally held between 11pm and 1 am. Once at the door he was blindfolded and taken before the master of ceremonies, who was often an elder ploughman. As in Masonic rituals there was then a prearranged and established exchange <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> answers that was to be given. In the case of the Horseman's Word and the Miller's Word this exchange was often a parody of catechism. After this was completed the inductee was then asked to seal the pact and shake hands with the devil, which would often be a branch or pole covered in animal fur.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} study that Dr. Kupferberg introduces to Dr. Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study {{when he and}} some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked forensic psychologist Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Dugan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after he read it and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides it has had enough of it.|$|E
500|$|In the 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn {{argued that}} the process of {{observation}} and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent [...] "portrait" [...] of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and [...] "puzzle solving" [...] which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.|$|E

As the family minister, Levett struggled to align his Puritan beliefs with this fun-loving household, which enjoyed dancing and exchanging valentine sentiments. [...] Cotton's advice was that valentines were like a lottery and [...] "a takeinge of Gods name in vaine," [...] though dancing was acceptable, if not done in a lewd way. [...] Levett was satisfied with the guidance.|$|E

500|$|The poem is {{an example}} of Keats's break from the {{structure}} of the classical form. It follows the poet's contemplation of a morning spent in idleness. Three figures are presented—Ambition, Love and Poesy — dressed in [...] "placid sandals" [...] and [...] "white robes". The narrator examines each using a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> statements on life and art. The poem concludes with the narrator giving up on having all three of the figures as part of his life. Some critics regard [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] as inferior to the other four 1819 odes. Others suggest that the poem exemplifies a continuity of themes and imagery characteristic of his more widely read works, and provides valuable biographical insight into his poetic career.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{structured}} around a fictional game show emceed by Cookie Masterson (voiced by Tom Gottlieb), {{in which the}} players answer ten multiple-choice questions, and then compete in a final [...] "Jack Attack" [...] round. Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players' scores, while incorrect answers are penalized. As per the game's motto, [...] "the irreverent trivia party game", the questions often combine general knowledge with popular culture references and verbal wordplay to determine the correct answer. Unlike the earlier releases which randomly presented questions, the 2011 game provides more than 73 episodes with a predefined set <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> with further episodes to be made available as DLC which is currently only available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through both consoles' respective online stores.|$|E

[...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing the right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1819, Keats had {{attempted}} to write sonnets, but found that the form did not satisfy his purpose because the pattern of rhyme worked against the tone that he wished to achieve. When {{he turned to the}} ode form, he found that the standard Pindaric form used by poets such as John Dryden was inadequate for properly discussing philosophy. Keats developed his own type of ode in [...] "Ode to Psyche", which preceded [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] and other odes he wrote in 1819. Keats's creation established a new poetic tone that accorded with his aesthetic ideas about poetry. He further altered this new form in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] by adding a secondary voice within the ode, creating a dialogue between two subjects. The technique of the poem is ekphrasis, the poetic representation of a painting or sculpture in words. Keats broke from the traditional use of ekphrasis found in Theocritus's Idyll, a classical poem that describes a design on the sides of a cup. While Theocritus describes both motion found in a stationary artwork and underlying motives of characters, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] replaces actions with a series <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> focuses only on external attributes of the characters.|$|E
500|$|Heydrich {{spoke for}} nearly an hour. Then {{followed}} about thirty minutes <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> comments, followed by some less formal conversation. Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)) [...] and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Reich Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative. Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital {{to the war effort}} and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed. Josef Bühler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible. Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained. [...] "The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together", Eichmann said, [...] "and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination". Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead he had found [...] "an atmosphere not only of agreement {{on the part of the}} participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Meghan Sullivan {{found the}} {{portrayal}} of the cadets' involvement in the war [...] "incredibly moving" [...] and was intrigued by the story's focus on war, but found the need to understand Orience's lore and mythology made the ending convoluted. Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar {{was fascinated by the}} game's setting and the questions it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game to get the full story, [...] " [...] you full <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> doubt from beginning to end." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had [...] "goofy faces and silly moments", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded him too much of poor-quality anime series.|$|E
