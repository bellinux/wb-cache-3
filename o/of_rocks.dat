40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{rheological}} {{mechanical characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass, a viscous-plastic model <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass which can describe the acceleration creep stage <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass was proposed. Moreover, combining with viscous-elastic shearing rheological model <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass in series, a new constitutive model of visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology was constructed. Due to the shearing rheological curves of granite, {{the model of}} visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology was identified and the rheological parameters of the model were obtained. The comparison between the viscous-elastic-plastic rheological model <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass and experimental result of granite shows that the accelerating rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass can be depicted effectively by the constitutive model of visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology...|$|R

For the rock mass which both index <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass strength for wear and 	abrasive strength <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> are small, the wear of side parts of tip progresses 	more rapidly rather than that of pointed end of tip.

40|$|Abstract. How the {{mechanical}} parameters <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> {{change with the}} development of joints and fractures is still a puzzle. It is hard to measure rock joints accurately at present. Resistivity is an important parameter <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> and its value can reflect the degree <b>of</b> fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>rock.</b> A new method combining measurement method of Young’s modulus with resistivity survey method is proposed in this paper. To determine the variation of mechanical parameters in the process <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> damage, the uniaxial, tri-axial compression tests and resistivity survey on rock specimens are done. The results showed that the values of resistivity were continuously increasing, but Young’s modulus and mechanical parameters were decreasing in the process <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> damage. The relationships between resistivity and mechanical parameters are established based on the experiments in the process <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> damage. Therefore, the damage state <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> and the change of mechanical parameters <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> can be determined according to the variance of resistivity. The study is helpful for design and real- time stability evaluation on rock engineering...|$|R

The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also what makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass {{deformability}} is {{an important}} but very challenging task in the analysis and design of underground structures in rock. Although various empirical (correlation) methods {{have been developed for}} determining the deformation modulus <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> masses, they come in many forms and are scattered in different sources. It is often difficult, time-consuming, or even impossible for a practitioner to find appropriate information to determine the deformation modulus <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> masses for a particular project. Therefore, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the different empirical methods for determining the deformation modulus <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> masses. Then a comparative analysis and discussion is carried out on the accuracy and main issues of these methods. Since many of the empirical methods for determining the deformation modulus <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> masses need to use the deformation modulus <b>of</b> intact <b>rock,</b> the various empirical methods for estimating the deformation modulus <b>of</b> intact <b>rock</b> are also reviewed. In addition, this paper highlights the scale effect on rock mass deformability, the effect of confining stress on rock mass deformability, and the anisotropy <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass deformability. Overall this paper outlines the key aspects <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass deformability and provides the fundamental and essential information required for effective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass deformability using the empirical methods...|$|R
