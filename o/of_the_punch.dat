5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch.</b> His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E

25|$|Bolo punch : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which {{owes its}} power to the {{shortening}} of a circular arc rather than to transference of body weight; it tends {{to have more of}} an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch.</b> This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard, and Kid Gavilan. Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.|$|E

Moreover, the news source added that multiple {{sources familiar with}} the [...] "baby mama" [...] and her family told them that they knew about the relationship between both parties. When the story broke out, close friends and associates of Wizkid didn't confirm the story due to DNA results that were pending at the time. Wizkid broke his silence on the story in several interviews. In an interview with a Nigerian Entertainment Today editor, Wizkid denied having a child. In another interview held at Ogudu-GRA in Lagos, Wizkid said he really doesn't want to find himself in that peculiar situation. A week before denying the aforementioned allegations, Wizkid tweeted from his official Twitter handle. In December 2012, he denied the baby scandal during an interview with Nonye Ben-Nwankwo <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Punch.</b> In October 2013, Wizkid uploaded a picture of he and his 2-year-old son, Boluwatife Balogun, onto his Instagram account.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Punching {{process is}} {{increasingly}} used in industry. <b>The</b> <b>punching</b> speeds increase induces <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> new mechanisms which {{are characterized by}} high strain rates like strain rate hardening <b>of</b> mate-rials. <b>The</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> speeds also involves <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> adiabatic shear bands (ASB). These effects result in improving the cutting quality. The critical releasing speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed phenomena depends on the workpiece material properties and on the process parameters. To understand and identify the activated mechanisms, a high speed punching device has been developed. The proposed device enables the user to reg-ulate a gap between punch and die of about 0. 1 mm with a precision of 0. 02 mm. In this paper we will present various aspects related to <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> device and an analysis of measurements obtained for a micro alloy steel S 600 M...|$|R

2500|$|The {{art of the}} {{editorial}} cartoon was further developed {{with the publication of}} the periodical Punch in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was Monthly Sheet of Caricatures, printed from 1830 and an important influence on Punch). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term [...] "cartoon" [...] to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and [...] "carttons" [...] for the mural were displayed for the public; the term [...] "cartoon" [...] then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or [...] in Italian.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC), in a volume percentage between 0. 75 and 1. 25, is being proposed to build slabs supported on piles and slabs supported on columns, where the unique conventional reinforcement {{is composed of}} some steel bars in <b>the</b> alignments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns/piles, designated as anti-progressive collapse bars. Punching resistance, however, can be a concern in this structural system. In fact, punching has a brittle failure character, and <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> resistance is still a challenge, even in concrete slabs with traditional reinforcement systems.

40|$|Abstract——- The {{greatest}} challenge faced by an engineer is {{to overcome the}} energy wasted due to friction in any mechanical process. In a conventional punching process, mechanical or hydraulic force is used to operate <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> which involves large amounts of metal to metal contact in the drive system components, as well as inaccuracy in <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> forces at <b>the</b> micro level. This paper introduces <b>the</b> basic construction <b>of</b> an Electromagnetic assisted punching machine to carry out <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> operation. <b>The</b> <b>punching</b> force is generated by an electromagnetic coil wound around a metal core. Since the proposed design replaces Mechanical or hydraulic drive with an electromagnetic actuator, the setup is capable <b>of</b> perfectly controlling <b>the</b> force generated by the controlling the power supplied. <b>The</b> micro <b>punching</b> setup is designed to punch small parts at a precisely controlled rate of power consumption and thus the process becomes a low friction, high efficiency process. After successful fabrication, the setup was tested and <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> force produced was validated. <b>The</b> <b>punched</b> samples were further analyzed optically for any defects such as burring and those results were documented...|$|R
