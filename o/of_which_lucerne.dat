25|$|Lucheni {{was brought}} before the Geneva Court in October.

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war the Ministry of Agriculture instigated a ploughing-up campaign {{as part of the}} 'War Effort'. Lord Iveagh agreed to increase the arable area as requested. 600 acre were ploughed, 200 acre <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were <b>Lucerne</b> leys, and the rest old lands that had been used for game and had gone out of cultivation. This proved discouraging, crops failing to cover the expense of growing them. The following year Lord Iveagh was asked to plough another 1000 acres (4 km²) and agreed to make the attempt even though the previous efforts had proved unsuccessful. All had to be fenced against rabbits and the wire was difficult to obtain.|$|R
50|$|After his arrest, Lucheni {{sought to}} be tried in the Canton <b>of</b> <b>Lucerne,</b> <b>which</b> had {{retained}} {{the death penalty and}} where, if convicted, he could gain martyrdom and widespread publicity.

At his trial, he openly admitted to his crime and was sentenced to life in prison.|$|R
50|$|After the Swiss Confederation became {{independent}} from the Habsburgs, the new Confederation began to expand. After the expansion to the Acht Orte (Eight Cantons), they {{began looking for}} further territory. As the city of Lucerne grew in power, they {{became interested in the}} southern portion of what would become the Freie Ämter. In 1394 they acquired the Amt <b>of</b> Merenschwand <b>which</b> gave <b>Lucerne</b> an exclave west of the river Reuss. In the Battle of Sempach, the Habsburg villages of Aristau and Meienberg were destroyed. Following the defeat of 1386, and despite the 1394 peace between the Habsburgs and the Confederation, the Habsburg city of Bremgarten entered into an alliance with Bern in 1407.|$|R
40|$|Dryland {{salinity}} is {{an increasing}} problem in Australia, due to the rising levels of salt-laden water tables. The primary cause for the increase in salinity {{is thought to be}} the replacement of native perennial vegetation in agricultural areas with annual crops and pastures that transpire less water. Greater use in agricultural systems <b>of</b> deep-rooted perennials, <b>which</b> have greater water requirements than annuals, will help to lower the water table and prevent further salinisation of soils. Lucerne (Medicago sativa) is the principal perennial pasture legume targetted to overcome dryland salinity in southern Australia. However, the acid sensitivity of Sinorhizobium, the microsymbiont of lucerne, limits M. sativa nodulation and establishment in many saline regions. Rhizobium tropici is a microsymbiont which is low pH tolerant; however it does not form an effective symbiosis with lucerne. This work aims to develop a strain <b>of</b> R. tropici <b>which</b> is both acid tolerant and able to effectively nodulate M. sativa, thus extending the range <b>of</b> soils in <b>which</b> <b>lucerne</b> can be grown. The megaplasmids of S. medicae WSM 419 required for an effective symbiosis with lucerne were marked and transferred into R. tropici via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. R. tropici transconjugants containing either pSymA or pSymB from WSM 419 were inoculated onto M. sativa seedlings. One of the R. tropici strains containing pSymA showed an enhanced ability to nodulate M. sativa, but the nodules were ineffective at fixing nitrogen. Current work is focussed on transferring both WSM 419 megaplasmids into R. tropici, in an effort to obtain an acid-tolerant microsymbiont that can fix nitrogen with M. sativai...|$|R

40|$|The key {{to pasture}} {{improvement}} in the tussock country of the South Island is in the introduction of high-producing legumes. White, red and alsike clovers {{have been widely used}} with considerable success. Lucerne, as yet, is much less important, even though it has been shown by Iversen (1965) that on droughty soils it can produce much more dry matter than conventional pastures. One of the main reasons for the lesser use of lucerne is the difficulty in establishing the plant by surface sowing methods, particularly in acid soils. Lucerne is particularly sensitive to acid soil conditions which affect establishment and growth in several ways. There are two possible approaches to overcoming problems of establishing lucerne on acid soils. The usual method is to modify the soil environment to suit the plant, by heavy broadcast liming. This is often uneconomic in tussock country owing to high transport costs. Another approach is to select strains of R. meliloti and species <b>of</b> <b>lucerne</b> <b>which</b> are more tolerant of acid soils. The latter approach has distinct possibilities, but, at present, it is a relatively new field. At Lincoln College an attempt is being made to combine both approaches in overcoming establishment problems in the tussock country...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this review}} {{is to focus on}} the {{potential}} utilisation <b>of</b> <b>lucerne</b> <b>which</b> could contribute more effectively to human nutrition and food sustainability. It aims to explore a proposed cycle for the promotion of lucerne for human consumption. Furthermore it seeks to propose lucerne as a potential vegetable and to briefly discuss the chemical composition, protein application, safety and medicinal uses of lucerne. Design/methodology/approach – A non-experimental approach, namely a systematic literature study, was used. During the study searches were done on the scientific databases Science Direct, Sabinet online, Emerald, EbscoHost and SpringerLink. Moreover internet searches were undertaken on the search engine, Google Scholar. Additionally, available textbooks and theses were consulted. Different combinations of keywords as well as synonyms for keywords were used during the searches. Some keywords used included lucerne, alfalfa and legumes. Findings – The high costs of animal protein have led to a growing interest in the industrial applications of lucerne in developing countries as lucerne is a valuable source of protein, suitable to produce nutritional food for human consumers. The full development of lucerne’s potential is hindered by a lack of awareness among consumers as well as by a lack of capacity within a research community. Therefore the key steps in the proposed cycle can be used to aid in the diversification of lucerne in the market place. Originality/value – To the author’s knowledge there exists a lack of previous reviews on lucerne. It is important for scientists to become aware of the nutritional and entrepreneurial potential and contribution for human consumption purposes in the future in order for the lucerne industry to diversify.

40|$|Concerning the {{pathogenesis}} of acute bloat, this {{has been shown to}} be closely associated with the production of gas during the rapid oxidation of sugar mainly by yeast cells as described above. Normal eructation of gas may be impeded as a result of excessive foam production in the forestomachs especially when animals are restricted to a diet of green lucerne. This foaming up of the ruminal mass is directly attributable to the presence <b>of</b> saponin in <b>lucerne</b> <b>which</b> through its action on surface tension retards the breaking of the foam. Undue frothing of the ruminal ingesta can be controlled by resorting to a feeding practice in <b>which</b> green <b>lucerne</b> is supplied to cattle and sheep only after the consumption of other foods.
