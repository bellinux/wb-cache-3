5|$|In 1858 Bennett {{returned}} to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned {{and did not}} arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was Professor <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cambridge from 1856 to 1866. In that year he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871.

5|$|In 1887 Stanford was {{appointed}} professor <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge {{in succession to}} Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to candidates {{who had not been}} undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university's music examinations. Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years' study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was an {{established}} court composer {{in the service}} of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in Mantua when he wrote his first operas, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, in the years 1606–08. After falling out with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice in 1613 and became director <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>at</b> St Mark's Basilica, a position he held {{for the rest of his}} life. Alongside his steady output of madrigals and church music, Monteverdi continued to compose works for the stage, though not actual operas. He wrote several ballets and, for the Venice carnival of 1624–25, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a hybrid work with some characteristics of ballet, opera and oratorio.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Stainer (6 June 1840– 31 March 1901) was an English {{composer}} and organist whose music, though not generally much performed today (except for The Crucifixion, still heard at Passiontide in many churches of the Anglican Communion), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music {{that are still}} influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather Professor <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E
5|$|Stainer {{was born}} in Southwark, London in 1840, {{the son of a}} cabinet maker. He became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral when aged ten and was {{appointed}} to the position of organist at St Michael's College, Tenbury at the age of sixteen. He later became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, and subsequently organist at St Paul's Cathedral. When he retired due to his poor eyesight and deteriorating health, he returned to Oxford to become Professor <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> the university. He died unexpectedly while on holiday in Italy in 1901.|$|E

5|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Stanford was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds triennial music festival.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm {{was the son}} of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. He left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, at {{the early}} age of 13 due to ill-health but showed a talent for music {{composition}} and some of his pieces were published during his childhood. He had piano lessons with Philip Halstead at Glasgow's Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton, the organist at Glasgow Cathedral. By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including an important one in Kingston upon Hull. The pianist Leff Pouishnoff then became his principal teacher and mentor. In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>at</b> Pictou Academy.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Walter Loving sought, and was granted, {{a medical}} {{disability}} due to worsening tuberculosis. He was replaced {{as director of}} the band by Pedro B. Navarro. Navarro had been with the PC Band since 1902, served as Loving's assistant conductor since 1904, and took over when Loving fell ill during the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition. He was succeeded by José Silos in 1918. During this period the quality of the band suffered and, in 1920, Loving returned to the Philippines to rebuild the group. As part of his long-term plan to ensure the future stability of the band, he hand-picked bandsman Alfonso Fresnido to succeed him. Fresnido was sent to Ohio to study conducting at the Dana Music Institute (now the Dana School <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>at</b> Youngstown State University) before returning to take over the band from Loving, who retired a second time in 1923.|$|E
