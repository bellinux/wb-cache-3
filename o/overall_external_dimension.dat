40|$|Degra (now in version 3) is a {{computer}} program that simulates {{the performance of a}} radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) over its lifetime. Degra is provided with a graphical user interface that is used to edit input parameters that describe the initial state of the RTG and the time-varying loads and environment to which it will be exposed. Performance is computed by modeling the flows of heat from the radioactive source and through the thermocouples, also allowing for losses, to determine the temperature drop across the thermocouples. This temperature drop is used to determine the open-circuit voltage, electrical resistance, and thermal conductance of the thermocouples. Output power can then be computed by relating the open-circuit voltage and the electrical resistance of the thermocouples to a specified time-varying load voltage. Degra accounts for the gradual deterioration of performance attributable primarily to decay of the radioactive source and secondarily to gradual deterioration of the thermoelectric material. To provide guidance to an RTG designer, given a minimum of input, Degra computes the dimensions, masses, and thermal conductances of important internal structures as well as the <b>overall</b> <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> and total mass...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the scaling of {{mechanical}} behaviour in bending of the metathoracic tibiae of the African desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is not predicted by the scaling of <b>external</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The flexural stiffness of the tibia scales to (body mass) 1. 53, which is similar to the predictions of the elastic similarity model of scaling. The <b>external</b> <b>dimensions,</b> however, scale in a manner that produces relatively more elongate limb segments – an observation that differs from the predictions of any existing scaling model. In this paper, we examined two alternative hypotheses to explain this uncoupling of morphology and mechanics: (1) that the load-bearing cuticular material is distributed in the legs {{in a manner that is}} not indicated by changes in <b>external</b> <b>dimensions,</b> or (2) that the stiffness of the cuticular material is altered to produce the observed scaling of flexural stiffness. The second moment of area (I) scaled to (body mass) 1. 19, which was similar to scaling I to (tibial radius) 4. This indicates that the relationship between the <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the tibiae and the specific distribution of load-bearing material is conserved independently of scale. Therefore, the locust achieves the observed scaling of flexural stiffness by altering the modulus of the load-bearing cuticular material. In fact, the time-dependent modulus (E 9) scales to (body mass) 0. 311. In essence, the scaled material stiffness provides a degree of freedom in design in addition to <b>external</b> morphological <b>dimensions</b> in accommodating the changing demands placed on a skeletal structure with increases in body size...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the process of {{identity}} construction taking place within the European Union. Through an analysis of how the Union constructs the internal dimension of its identity in its domestic sphere targeting the citizens of its Member States and how it constructs the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of its identity in the international sphere targeting mainly the non-member states and their citizens, the thesis seeks to answer the question to what extent the internal and <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the EU's identity, as analysed {{within the framework of the}} education policy and the foreign policy of the Union, form a coherent whole. It argues that identity has two dimensions: an <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> which corresponds to the projection of the political community onto the world, and an internal one in which the idea of this imagined political community is projected back onto its citizens. Building on this framework, the thesis claims that these two facets of identity form a coherent and meaningful identity framework, the internal and <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> of which are constructed in quite similar and complementary ways. It also argues that the representations of the internal and external facets of the EU's identity illustrate great similarities in the way they were conceptualised, promoted and linked to the overall policy objectives of the Union in the two policy areas discussed within the framework of this study.

40|$|The {{abolition}} of the ‘third pillar’ of the European Union has apparently reinforced the ‘Community method’ in the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ). However, the objectives of this Area are pursued through several activities, characterised by different procedures and actors. This contribution intends {{to demonstrate that the}} creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) can enhance the coherence of the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the AFSJ, because the Service is tasked with the coordination of the entire external action. It is submitted that the EEAS can foster the effectiveness of the law-making and policy implementation phases and it can ensure the unity of the EU’s diplomatic representation. The potential of the EEAS is particularly evident with respect to security, because the Service can effectively coordinate the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and non-CFSP aspects of the EU’s security management. However, the EEAS is largely influenced by the intergovernmental method, and its involvement in non-CFSP initiatives may perpetuate the intergovernmental approach to the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the AFSJ...|$|R

40|$|This project {{examines}} why the EU {{is developing}} an <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of their asylum policy and which humanitarian consequenses this cause. The project is build on a {{hypothesis that the}} <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the asylum policy is a breach of the etablished rules. This breach can {{be a result of}} a securization of asylum seeker’s and refugee’s. To investigate whether the development of the externel dimension of EU’s asylum policy is an expression of a securization, the discource and legislation is analysed. The analysis conclude the conflicting result that the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> is breaking the rules of the refugee convention, but that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s haven’t been represented as a threat. In spite of this the context that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s are situated in can constitute a discource whereby the object is securized anyway. In addition to that the lacking media coverage of EU politician’s can imply that they can lead a policy that is different to the one that was represented. The ekstraterritorialization lead to a number of consequenses, partly because the right to seek asylum is restricted and partly because the quality of protection that is provided towards refugee’s is reduced...|$|R
