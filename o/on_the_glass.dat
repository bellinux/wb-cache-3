5|$|In {{support of}} this album, Bowie {{embarked}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> Spider Tour, a world tour that {{was at that point}} the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White Noise in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E

25|$|As glass cools, it shrinks and solidifies. Uneven cooling causes weak glass due to stress. Even cooling is {{achieved}} by annealing.

25|$|The {{dressing}} rooms for all actors are arranged around an internal lightwell and airshaft and so their windows each face each other.

40|$|A {{straight}} nanogroove striped pattern can {{be formed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of NiO thin film by room temperature epitaxial growth in pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on a 0. 2 nm-high regularly stepped sapphire (α-Al 2 O 3 single crystal) (0001) substrate and post annealing of the film. The interval {{and depth of}} each nanogroove were about 80 and 20 nm, respectively. Wedge shaped nanogrooves were observed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire film (~ 10 × 10 mm 2) and characterized on an atomic scale by high resolu-tion transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using the nanogrooved NiO thin film or atomically stepped sapphire substrate as thermal nanoimprint mold for glass, surface nanopatterning of <b>the</b> silicate <b>glass</b> plate was successfully carried out. The straight nanogroove pattern or sub-nanometer stepped pattern were inversely transferred onto <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> surface. Growth control of transparent conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films was then examined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nanoscale step-patterned <b>glass</b> plates by PLD. The surface morphology of the obtained ITO thin films reflected the stepped pattern of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> plate well. Strongly oriented film growth was achieved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nanopatterned <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> resistivity of ITO thin film deposited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nanoimprinted <b>glass</b> was {{lower than that of}} <b>the</b> film <b>on</b> <b>the</b> commercial <b>glass...</b>|$|R
25|$|Exterior glass— The {{exterior}} {{glass on}} the west and south sides of the building provides an aesthetically pleasing view {{of the river and}} downtown and also provides natural lighting. This feature proved challenging for those designing an energy efficient structure. They found a solution with a custom-designed white dot pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> and strategically placed columns to maximize views, minimize glare and reduce solar heat gain by 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|Besides the camera, {{other methods}} of forming images with light are available. For instance, a {{photocopy}} or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses {{the transfer of}} static electrical charges rather than photographic medium, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, {{without the use of}} a camera. Objects can also be placed directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> of an image scanner to produce digital pictures.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} mask from fogging up due to {{condensation}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of}} the plate and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.|$|E
60|$|If {{instead of}} the Prisms the Object-glasses be made use of, the Rings which they exhibit become not white and {{distinct}} by the obliquity of the Eye, by reason that the Rays in their passage through that Air which intercedes <b>the</b> <b>Glasses</b> are very nearly parallel to those Lines {{in which they were}} first incident <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Glasses,</b> and consequently <b>the</b> Rays endued with several Colours are not inclined one more than another to that Air, as it happens in the Prisms.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tin-oxide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} properties of soda-lime-silica glasses was investigated. Glasses containing tin-oxide concentrations ranging from 0 to 3 mol% were synthesized in the laboratory. In some of <b>the</b> <b>glasses,</b> an {{attempt was made}} to control the ratio of Sn 2 + to Sn 4 + present in <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Dilatometry, beam-bending viscosity, and sonic resonance experiments were performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> to determine <b>the</b> role of tin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thermal expansion, <b>glass</b> transition temperature, ditatometric softening temperature, annealing temperature, strain temperature, and elastic modulus of <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to determine the presence and relative amount of Sn 2 + and Sn 4 + in <b>the</b> <b>glasses.</b> <b>The</b> data suggest that the substitution of relatively small amounts of tin for a modifier species in <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> composition results in an increase in the network connectivity. In addition, the results suggest that this increase in network connectivity is more apparent in glasses containing higher relative amounts of Sn 4 + Compared to Sn 2 +.
