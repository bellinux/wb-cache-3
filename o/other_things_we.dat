Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, [...] "What's not to like about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among <b>other</b> <b>things)</b> <b>we</b> are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?" [...] Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts, saying it was, [...] "A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to-friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful." ...|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|To {{compete with}} Nintendo, Sega was {{more open to}} new types of games than its rival, but still tightly {{controlled}} the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing. Technicians from American third-party video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989, following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system. The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development. EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), noting that EA {{had the ability to}} run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES. EA signed what Hawkins described as [...] "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" [...] with Sega in June 1990: [...] "Among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. We also had more direct control over manufacturing." [...] After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that [...] "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" [...] and [...] "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," [...] noting [...] "It just would have been a public relations fiasco." [...] EA released its first two Genesis games, Populous and , within the month. The first Genesis version of EA's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990, and became what Gordon called a [...] "killer app" [...] for the system. Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.|$|E

2500|$|Under Winchell's sponsorship, Howard Rushmore {{became the}} chief {{editor of a}} New York scandal magazine, Confidential. Its publisher, Robert Harrison, began as an office boy and later writer for Bernarr McFadden's New York Graphic during the 1920s, an {{ancestor}} of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. It was at the Graphic where the young Harrison first met Walter Winchell. As an adult Harrison was on the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald, a trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., had {{close ties to the}} Hays Office. Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. Supposedly inspired by the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison later launched a tabloid-style gossip magazine. It concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones."

[...] Before Rushmore's tenure at Confidential, Harrison published stories like “Is It True What They Say About Johnnie Ray?" [...] and [...] "Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!" [...] With [...] "Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!", Harrison came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving [...] "racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes," [...] "exposés of star secrets" [...] became Confidentials prime focus.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
