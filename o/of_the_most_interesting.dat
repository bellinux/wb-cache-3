5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E
