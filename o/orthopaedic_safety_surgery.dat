40|$|Purpose. MaQaid (MaQ) {{is a new}} {{triamcinolone}} acetonide commercialised in Japan to visualize the vitreous. Because MaQ is preservative-free, it has a lower risk of ocular toxicities. However, since MaQ is only available as a powder, it needs suspenssion. Suspension does not always result uniformally, which causes poor visibility. This study reports a new MaQ suspension for better visibility. Methods. After medium addition to a MaQ vial, various methods were used. These included the use of (1) vortex mixer, (2) two syringes and a three-way stopcock, and (3) ultrasonic washer. We calculated suspended MaQ concentration (). To evaluate the reproducibility, we estimated the coefficient of variance (CV,). We used this MaQ for pig eyes, and vitreous visualization was simulated. Subsequently, we used this MaQ suspension for humans. Results. MaQ suspensions were sucessfull, and the concentrations of single particles increased significantly (). The CV was 36. 1 % for the routine method and 9. 03 % ffor the new method. Administration of a suspended MaQ {{made it possible to}} clearly visualize the vitreous in both pig and human eyes. Conclusions. We devised new techniques for uniformal MaQ suspension. These new methods can compensate for the MaQ disadvantages and ensure a <b>safety</b> <b>surgery...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Internal {{acoustic}} meatus {{is about}} one cm length and opens {{near the center of}} posterior surface of the petrous part of temporal bone. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the occupation of porus acousticus internus in facies posterior of petrous part of temporal bone. Material and Methods: In this study, 100 temporal bones of 50 dry skulls (unknown sex) were examined. The areas of whole surface of the facies posterior of petrous part and porus acousticus internus were calculated with the help of the Cavalieri principle. The ratio of the porus acousticus internus to facies posterior was calculated. The posterior wall length of internal acoustic meatus vertical and sagittal diameter of the porus were also measured. Results: The ratio of area of the porus acousticus internus to facies posterior partis petrosa was 4. 82 % on the right and 4. 54 % on the left. The length of the posterior wall was 15 mm on the right and 14 mm on the left. Vertical diameter was 4. 51 mm on the right and 4. 55 mm on the left and sagittal diameter was 6. 85 mm on the right and 6. 61 mm on the left.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Evaluation {{of safety}} and {{postoperative}} outcomes of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during pediatric tonsil surgery compared to use of the endotracheal tube (ETT). Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: A population-based sample of 117 patients ages 2 to 18 years requiring adenotonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or tonsillectomy was studied. Evaluation forms covering 36 <b>safety,</b> <b>surgery</b> duration, and patient comfort variables {{were given to the}} surgeon, anesthesiologist, and phase I and phase II recovery nurses to collect data on the intra- and postoperative course. A phone survey was conducted 24 hours after surgery. Results: At the a level following Bonferroni correction, LMA showed less coughing or gagging during the anesthesia phase for all surgeries combined (48 % for ETT vs. 20 % for LMA; v 2 10. 153, P. 002), and for ETT nontonsillectomy vs. LMA nontonsillectomy (48 % for ETT vs. 3 % for LMA; v 2 15. 196, P. 000), spontaneous ventilation was used more often in the LMA group when comparing all surgeries (v 2 19. 493, P. 000), and when comparing ETT tonsillectomy and LMA tonsillectomy (v 2 11. 131, P. 000). Conclusions: Use of the LMA during pediatric tonsil surgery {{does not appear to have}} any major disadvantages com-pared to use of the ETT. In fact, analysis of safety, comfort, complications, and postoperative problems suggests that LMA may be superior for some outcome variables such as coughing and gagging.

Although in this series there was no relationship between gestational age, β-hCG level and size of gestational sac, and <b>safety</b> of <b>surgery,</b> {{it is probable that}} it is more likely to encounter difficulties in more advanced gestation.

50|$|To examine {{scheduling}} challenges, consider {{three possible}} surgical scenarios: elective (e.g. cosmetic procedures, stable situations not increasing in severity), imminent (e.g. inflamed gall bladder removal, potential for worsening harm if situations not surgically corrected,) and emergency surgeries (e.g. burst appendix, {{situations in which}} death or disability is possible or likely). The majority of operative time {{is a combination of}} elective and imminent surgeries. Albeit a smaller percentage, emergency surgical cases must always be handled promptly in order to ensure patient <b>safety.</b> Emergency <b>surgeries</b> are often unforeseeable and present a scheduling challenge as a result. Therefore, from a management perspective, one must use the elective and imminent surgical cases as a guideline for pre-determining operative schedules, while allowing flexibility for the emergency situations that indubitably arise.|$|R
