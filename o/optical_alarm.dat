40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report was to from a {{scientific}} perspective develop and evaluate the risks for people with disabilities, primarily hearing and visually impaired, in public premises. More than one fifth of the Swedish population suffers from a hearing or visual impairment. Their disability complicates their everyday and social life. Public places and buildings create barriers {{and in some cases}} hazards to them. Today Sweden is classified as one of the world’s most equal countries where disability, gender, race or religion doesn’t matter because you should still have the same privileges. This is based among other things on the Instrument of Government which is one of four fundamental laws in Sweden. Another tool in the politic of disability is the UN Standard Rules and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Other legislation concerning the subject is the Planning and Building Act and Building Regulations. Fire protection consists of two types of barriers, soft and hard. The soft represents the organizational fire protection in the form of systematic fire prevention, training of staff, procedures in case of fire, and more. While the hard barriers account for the structural and technical fire protection such as sprinklers, evacuation points, fire compartmentation, and more. Both types require continuous maintenance and updating. All this is done by the human people who in its nature often make errors. This may lead to latent conditions and active failures. In an emergency you see a pattern of human behavior. This information can provide insight into how the fire protection should be constructed to make the evacuation time as short as possible. The evacuation time comprises three phases; perception time, decision and reaction time and transfer time. The work is based on an extensive literature study divided in two areas of focus together with object studies. Based on the object studies conclusions could be made that the level of risk for a hearing or visually impaired person is not acceptable. In some cases, the fire protection is inadequate even for a person without a disability. Based on the theory that has been studied and the site visits made, there are important steps in the fire protection that should be highlighted and reviewed from a disabled person's point of view. The organizational fire protection framework must ensure continuous training and exercise so that procedures should not be forgotten. There should be alarms so that people with disabilities also may be aware of a fire, such as an <b>optical</b> <b>alarm</b> or a vibration alarm. In an emergency, it should be easy to orientate with the the help of handrails, contrast markings and tactile aids. Even the way the building is constructed matter. A logical building is easier to understand and therefore an internal mental map is more easily formed. The planning and construction of public buildings should always take into account that people differ in terms of abilitity. Also existing facilities need continuous improvements. The individual must be in focus and to achieve full participation the entire premises should be considered, not only partly. Terms which are not equivalent can affect a person's social life and how they think of themselves. It can lead to alienation and other social problems. By taking this into consideration, Sweden can become the country which the country's laws prescribe and that other nations look up to. Validerat; 20131007 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
25|$|Regular {{cleaning}} {{can prevent}} false alarms {{caused by the}} build-up of dust and insects, particularly on <b>optical</b> type <b>alarms</b> as they {{are more susceptible to}} these factors. A vacuum cleaner can be used to clean domestic smoke detectors to remove detrimental dust. Optical detectors are less susceptible to false alarms in locations such as near a kitchen producing cooking fumes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{telecommunication}} {{systems are}} growing {{more and more}} complex, generating {{a large amount of}} alarms that cannot be effectively managed by human operators. The problem is to detect significant combinations of alarms describing an issue in real-time. In this article, we present a powerful heuristic algorithm that constructs dependency graphs of alarm patterns. More precisely, it highlights patterns extracted from an alarm flow obtained from a learning process with a small footprint on network management system performance. This algorithm helps to detect issues in real-time by effectively delivering concise alarm patterns. Furthermore, it allows the proactive analysis of the functioning of a network by computing the general trends of this network. We evaluate our algorithm on an <b>optical</b> network <b>alarm</b> data set of an existing operator. We find similar results as the expert analysis performed for this operator by Alcatel-Lucent Customer Services...|$|R
40|$|Models {{have been}} used to {{estimate}} smoke detector alarm times by calculating smoke optical densities resulting from fires and correlating the smoke value to an alarm threshold of the detector. This work evaluated the use of smoke optical densities outside a detector as criteria for predicting smoke detector responses. Results are presented for <b>optical</b> density <b>alarm</b> thresholds corresponding to when 20, 50 and 80 percent of the detectors had alarmed in full-scale tests. The data showed that there was a large amount of variability in the measured smoke optical density values outside a detector at the time of alarm. Major variables evaluated included detector type, fire type and nominal detector sensitivity. This evaluation also examined experimental smoke optical density data at the time of detector alarms and compared these smoke values to alarm thresholds recommended in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{detector}} {{sensitive to}} only the ultraviolet radiation emitted by flames {{has been selected}} as the basic element of the NASA Skylab fire detection system. It is sensitive to approximately 10 (exp - 12) W of radiation and will detect small flames at distances in excess of 3 m. The performance of the detector was verified by experiments in an aircraft flying zero-gravity parabolas to simulate {{the characteristics of a}} fire which the detector must sense. Extensive investigation and exacting design was necessary to exclude all possible sources of false <b>alarms.</b> <b>Optical</b> measurements were made on all the spacecraft windows to determine the amount of solar radiation transmitted. The lighting systems and the onboard experiments also were appraised for ultraviolet emissions. Proton-accelerator tests were performed to determine the interaction of the Earth's trapped radiation belts with the detectors and the design of the instrument was modified to negate these effects...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 it was {{proposed}} that the British Standard for domestic smoke alarms be revised {{in order to bring}} the fire sensitivity tests established in the British Standard, BS 5446 : Part 1 : 1990, into line with those in the British/European standard for commercial point-type smoke sensors, BS 5445 /EN 54 : Part 9 : 1984 and to reduce nuisance alarms which smoke detector manufacturers considered to be a problem. The UK Home Office wished to be reassured that a reduction in the sensitivity would not constitute a significant reduction in the level of life safety provided by the devices. A series of eleven tests were conducted to examine the performance of a range of smoke detectors. The fires were selected to closely match the fire sensitivity tests specified in the BS/EN/ISO stand-ards or as representative of realistic fire scenarios. The tests were conducted in a detached three-bedroom dwelling of typical 1970 ’s UK design and construction. Optical and ionisation domestic smoke alarms and commercial analogue addressable smoke sensors, complying with UK and US standards, were installed in four locations within the dwelling; in the lounge, in the hall, on the landing and in a bedroom. The optical density of smoke close to the detectors was also measured. In each location, the times to alarm for each detector and the time at which the density of the smoke reached a hazardous level were recorded. The time between an alarm and the onset of the smoke density hazard was calculated for each smoke detector. These data were analysed by com-paring the performance of individual smoke detectors, by using standard statistical methods for groups of detectors and by ranking the relative performance of each smoke detector across a range of tests. For detectors complying with the UK domestic and commercial standards, analogue sensors responded as well as or, in some cases, better than the domestic smoke alarms {{depending on the type of}} fire. The overall performance of the analogue and domestic detectors were statistically similar. The ranking analysis indicated that the analogue optical sensors performed better than the domestic <b>optical</b> smoke <b>alarms</b> whereas the ionisation detectors exhibited a similar performance. Therefore, revising the domestic smoke alarm requirements to match the commercial smoke sensor standard would not reduce the life safety effectiveness of domestic smoke alarms. Analysis of the performance of the detectors complying with the US standards found that the domestic ionisation smoke alarm and the analogue ionisation smoke sensor showed a statistically significant variability. The ranking analysis indicated that the domestic ionisation smoke alarm detected smoke earlier than the analogue ionisation smoke sensor. In the case of the optical devices, the overall performance of the two types was statistically similar. However, the ranking analysis indicated that the analogue optical sensor performed better in some types of fire scenario...|$|R
