5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with {{another round of}} ion-exchange treatment.|$|E

5|$|Of the pardoned mutineers, Heywood and Morrison {{returned}} to naval duty. Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and, by 1803 {{at the age}} of 31, had achieved the rank of captain. After a distinguished career, he died in 1831. Morrison became a master gunner, and was eventually lost in 1807 when HMS Blenheim foundered in the Indian Ocean. Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death, in or before 1798. The other principal participants in the court martial—Fryer, Peckover, Coleman, McIntosh and others—generally vanished from the public eye after the closing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
30|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgical staging, {{more specifically}} cytoreductive surgery, are time-consuming procedures {{that are associated}} with surgeon fatigue that ensues with <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> This method offers <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> conventional laparoscopy at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case followed by <b>the</b> robotic-assisted portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure,</b> which can help in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> surgeon fatigue during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> these lengthy procedures.

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> from the CSBS model.|$|E
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} taken to the nearby town of Slatina for {{forensic}} examination on 17 December. Mackley contacted Croatian authorities and obtained permission to document the autopsies of the victims, but was denied access by authorities in Slatina. Mackley telephoned Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak asking him to intervene on his behalf, but the local police allegedly disobeyed Šušak. The special police was deployed to Slatina to enforce Šušak's order to cooperate, almost causing an armed clash over the issue. To settle matters, a team was sent to Slatina by Zagreb University's Institute for Forensic Medicine to perform autopsies, retrieve bodies and perform the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> in Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few months, Cranmer and the king worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once the procedures were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train haulage contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, {{a new report}} from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen had severe safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, and was not performing safety analysis. Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt that the issues taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E

25|$|Cosmetic {{surgery is}} an {{optional}} or elective surgery that is performed on normal {{parts of the}} body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled {{since the start of the}} century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical (p.5). They also found that a large majority, 81%, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> were done on Caucasian people (p.12).|$|E

25|$|European {{travelers}} in the Great Lakes {{region of}} Africa during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed {{on a regular}} basis.

Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|The final option, {{if other}} {{measures}} have failed, is heart transplantation or (temporary or prolonged) implantation of an artificial heart.

These commonly involve surgical left ventricular remodeling. The aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> is to reduce the ventricle diameter (targeting Laplace's law and the disease mechanism of heart failure), improve its shape and/or remove non-viable tissue. These procedures can be performed together with coronary artery bypass surgery or mitral valve repair.|$|E
25|$|The {{underwater}} {{environment is}} unfamiliar and hazardous, {{and to ensure}} diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed.

In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed.|$|E

It therefore came with a series of recommendations. Broadcast of the regional QFF should be done on time and as a priority. All clearances into a control zone should include the regional QFF and any local reading should not be given. Altimeter setting messages should be sent on their own and not included in other messages to avoid confusion. Air traffic procedures should be uniformly applicable to all users. Air traffic officers should be examined periodically. Ensure that there is no possibility of controllers confusing future regional QFF with the current QFF. RAF crews should be given more information on procedures in the Metropolitan Control Zone.|$|E
