5|$|<b>Ochre</b> is {{reported}} from some early MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues {{that even if}} some of this <b>ochre</b> was used in a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction could not have worked without language. <b>Ochre,</b> he suggests, could be one proxy for {{trying to find the}} emergence of language.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the site}} {{contains}} rock paintings at 13 different locations, with depictions of humans painted in red <b>ochre</b> in six rock shelters. The similar occurrence of rock paintings and rock engravings is very rare.|$|E
5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral yellow <b>ochre</b> {{mixed with}} pitch from the piñon tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower lupine {{and a warm}} grey from Juniper {{mistletoe}} (Phoradendron juniperinum).|$|E
50|$|Earth {{pigments}} - or <b>ochres</b> - in red, {{yellow and}} black are used, also mineral oxides {{of iron and}} manganese and white pipeclay, or calcium carbonate. <b>Ochres</b> may be fixed with a binder such as PVA glue, or previously, with the sap or juice of plants such as orchid bulbs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe first {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{underline}} a relevant colorimetric co-ordinate characterizing the colour of <b>ochres</b> within their extremely wide range, from pale yellow to dark red. The second purpose is to link together quantitatively the variations of this colorimetric co-ordinate and the various chemical compositions of the samples, mainly hematite, goethite and white pigments. A group of 30 modern <b>ochres</b> and a group of 20 ancient <b>ochres</b> have been investigated. All these natural pigments have been commercialized. Diffuse reflectance spectrometry allows to calculate the colorimetric co-ordinates in the CIE-L*a*b* space and the position of the absorption band of each sample. Physico-chemical analysis has been obtained by quantitative X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmitting electronic microscopy and particle-size analysis by laser diffraction. The positive a* co-ordinate (redness) has been underlined, for the first time, to be the only relevant colorimetric parameter to characterize the colour of the <b>ochres.</b> Its variations are quantitatively connected to the shift of the absorption band due to the charge transfer between the ligand (OH− or O 2 −) and the Fe 3 + ion contained in goethite and/or hematite. For <b>ochres</b> containing both hematite and goethite, the a* co-ordinate linearly increases with the relative amount of hematite while the absorption band progressively shifts towards the high wavelengths. Such a linear shift of the absorption band has never been underlined before. For <b>ochres</b> containing only one iron oxide, a* linearly decreases with the amount of white pigments, whatever the nature of the white charges. Moreover, this study gives the opportunity to show that only the nature, the amount and the size distribution of the white charges allow to discriminate the <b>ochres</b> according to their geographic origin...|$|R

5|$|Lyn Wadley et al. {{have argued}} that the {{complexity}} of the skill needed to process the heat-treated compound glue (gum and red <b>ochre)</b> used to haft spears would seem to argue for continuity between modern human cognition and that of humans 70,000 BP at Sibudu Cave.|$|E
5|$|Pot wares {{in varying}} designs in post-firing {{painting}} technique in <b>ochre</b> colour, generally of grey ware and few in red-ware were also found. The Chalcolithic pottery unearthed {{at the site}} are of black and red ware pots and pans.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} problems facing rock art researchers is understanding the age of their subject. In the absence of numeric age determinations, rock art chronologies have often been inferred by extrapolating the ages associated with subsurface <b>ochres.</b> Here I have used portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) to assess if the association between rock art and buried <b>ochres</b> proposed by researchers at two sites in the Sydney Basin — Dingo and Horned Anthropomorph and Yengo 1 — can be demonstrated. I found that pXRF can determine if there is no relationship between archaeological pigments. Where geochemical similarities are found, pXRF does not have the analytic precision to unequivocally link archaeological <b>ochres,</b> but it does provide a robust and readily accessible step in the right direction. The method outlined here therefore provides an inexpensive means of generating complementary chronological (and behavioural) information within rock art studies. Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|The {{voice of}} Captain <b>Ochre</b> was {{provided}} by English-born Canadian, Jeremy Wilkin. Having served {{in the role of}} Virgil Tracy during the second series of Thunderbirds, Wilkin remained to voice <b>Ochre</b> for the subsequent production. The character of Captain Magenta, meanwhile, was voiced by Gary Files. Another Australian actor, Files was a fresh addition to Century 21 Productions, and was cast for a number of roles in the second Thunderbirds film, Thunderbird 6, before progressing to the role of Magenta for Captain Scarlet. Like Files, Welsh actress Liz Morgan was new to the Anderson productions and voiced the regular characters of Destiny Angel, the lead pilot of the Spectrum Angel fighter squadron, and one of her subordinates, Rhapsody Angel.|$|E
5|$|Variety queletiformis can be {{distinguished}} from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap, while var. lupiniformis has a pale yellow or dirty <b>ochre</b> cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined <b>ochre</b> in the Toolumbunner <b>ochre</b> pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} used on a staff that is colored gold (<b>ochre).</b> Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red <b>ochre.</b> Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E

5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with <b>ochre</b> to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} smack of 59 tons burthen {{that was a}} part of the fishing fleet at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast. The wooden boat had a flush deck, two masts, and no engine. Inverlyons sails were fore-and-aft rigged and may have been red <b>ochre</b> in colour, the {{traditional}} sail colour for British smacks.|$|E
5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of {{the areas of the}} leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of <b>ochre</b> mosaic spots, and crinkling of the leaves in infected plants.|$|E
30|$|The {{study has}} {{also looked at}} the wider palette present which is {{comprised}} of red and yellow <b>ochres,</b> carbon black, cinnabar, calcite and gypsum on kaolinite grounds, consistent with Hellenistic period terracottas [10] and decorated ceramics.|$|R

5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow <b>ochres,</b> two red <b>ochres,</b> raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|R
