40|$|Objective: <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterised by oesophageal aperistalsis, an increased resting pressure with partial or incomplete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder manifested by binge eating attacks followed by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. Dysphagia, regurgitation, vomiting, retrosternal pain, heartburn, weight loss, avoidance of eating, consumption of large amount of liquids and aberrant eating behaviours are symptoms of both achalasia and BN. Owing to these common signs and symptoms, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> can be misdiagnosed as an eating disorder. In addition, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> can occur as a complication of BN. It {{is often difficult to}} distinguish organic and psychological vomiting or comorbidity because of overlapping of the symptoms. Case report: We report the case of a patient who developed <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> following severe, repetitive vomiting as a complication of BN. Conclusion: We want to raise awareness regarding the development of a medical illness {{in the presence of a}} psychiatric disorder. Importantly, physicians should have a fundamental knowledge of these two diseases regarding their clinical patterns to differentially diagnose one or both disorders as quickly as possible...|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{diagnosis}} and classification of oesophageal motility disorders is currently based on {{assessment of the}} phasic contractile activity of the oesophagus. Tonic muscular contraction of the oesophageal body (oesophageal tone) has not been well characterised.  Aim—To quantify oesophageal tonic activity in healthy subjects and in patients with achalasia.  Patients—Oesophageal tone was measured in 14 patients with untreated achalasia and in 14 healthy subjects. In eight patients with <b>achalasia,</b> <b>oesophageal</b> tone was again measured one month after either endoscopic or surgical treatment.  Methods—Tonic wall activity was quantified {{by means of a}} flaccid intraoesophageal bag, 5 cm long and of 120 ml maximal capacity, which was placed and maintained 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter and connected to an external electronic barostat. The experimental design included measurement of oesophageal basal tone and compliance as well as the oesophageal tone response to a nitric oxide donor (0. 5 ml amyl nitrite inhalation).  Results—Oesophageal basal tone, expressed as the intrabag (intraoesophageal) volume at a minimal distending pressure (2 mm Hg), did not differ significantly between patients with achalasia and healthy controls (6. 6 (2. 5) ml versus 4. 1 (0. 8) ml, respectively). Oesophageal compliance (volume/pressure relation during intraoesophageal distension) was significantly increased in <b>achalasia</b> (<b>oesophageal</b> extension ratio: 3. 2 (0. 4) ml/mm Hg versus 1. 9 (0. 2) ml/mm Hg; p< 0. 01). Amyl nitrite inhalation induced oesophageal relaxation both in patients and in controls, but the magnitude of relaxation was greater in the latter (intrabag volume increase: 15. 3 (2. 4) ml versus 36. 2 (7. 1) ml; p< 0. 01).  Conclusion—In patients with <b>achalasia,</b> <b>oesophageal</b> tonic activity, and not only phasic activity, is impaired. Although oesophageal compliance is increased, residual oesophageal tone is maintained so that a significant relaxant response may occur after pharmacological stimulation. ...|$|R
40|$|A 72 year-old man {{presented}} severe dysphagia {{and weight}} loss of recent onset. Repeated oesophageal endoscopy and biopsies with macroforceps were normal. Oesophageal manometry disclosed features compatible with <b>achalasia.</b> <b>Oesophageal</b> EUS endoscopy localized an infiltrating process between muscular layers of the oesophageal wall and CT scan delimited a circular thickening in the inferior part of the oesophagus. Because of severe clinical presentation mimicking a possible oesophageal neoplasm like a lymphoma, partial oesophagectomy was performed and revealed eosinophilic oesophagitis. This unusual presentation emphasizes that idiopathic eosinophilic oesophagitis must be proposed in the differential diagnosis of dysphagia, even in old patient without apparent oesophageal lesion at endoscopy.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in 30 {{patients}} affected by a mild or moderate degree of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> to compare the clinical and manometric effects of sublingual nifedipine and pneumatic dilatation. Sixteen patients were dilated twice with Rider-Moeller dilators and 14 were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10 - 20 mg 30 minutes before meals. A manometric evaluation was performed before and six months after starting treatment. The clinical evaluation (according to Vantrappen's criteria) was performed every three months for a mean follow up of 21 months. In both groups of patients a significant (p less than 0. 001) fall in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was observed after treatment and excellent or good clinical results were observed in 75 % of dilated patients and in 77 % of patients treated with nifedipine.

40|$|Background: Allgrove (or triple A) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder. The triad consists of three most prominent features of the syndrome. First, Alacrimia (absence of tears). Second, <b>achalasia</b> (<b>oesophageal</b> motility disorder). Finally, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -resistant adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). The {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12 q 13.

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} {{our experience}} of 150 patients to assess the clinical value of radionuclide oesophageal transit measurements in relation to established <b>oesophageal</b> motility investigations. <b>Achalasia</b> and conditions characterised by incoordinate oesophageal motor activity were detected with equal frequency by manometry and radionuclide transit measurement. Radionuclide transit measurements identified abnormalities not detected by manometry in 18 patients, and manometry was abnormal in 26 patients with normal radionuclide studies, including all patients with nutcracker oesophagus and most with hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter. The overall sensitivity of radionuclide transit measurements in detecting oesophageal dysmotility was 75 %, the sensitivity of manometry was 83 % and that of conventional barium radiology 30 %. We conclude that radionuclide transit measurement is a useful test for patients with suspected oesophageal motility disorders.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} mid-term {{outcomes}} of laparoscopic calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication with Dor fundoplication performed after Heller myotomy for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia.</b> METHODS: Fifty-six patients (26 men, 30 women; mean age 42. 8 1; 14. 7 years) presenting for {{minimally invasive surgery}} for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia,</b> were enrolled. All patients underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy followed by a 180 0; anterior partial fundoplication in 30 cases (group 1) and calibrated Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication in 26 (group 2). Intraoperative endoscopy and manometry were used to calibrate the myotomy and fundoplication. A 6 -mo follow-up period with symptomatic evaluation and barium swallow was undertaken. One and two years after surgery, the patients underwent symptom questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 h oesophago-gastric pH monitoring. RESULTS: At the 2 -year follow-up, {{no significant difference in}} the median symptom score was observed between the 2 groups (P = 0. 66; Mann-Whitney U-test). The median percentage time with oesophageal pH < 4 was significantly higher in the Dor group compared to the Nissen-Rossetti group (2; range 0. 8 - 10 vs 0. 35; range 0 - 2) (P < 0. 0001; Mann-Whitney U-test).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic {{achalasia}} {{is a rare}} motor {{disorder of}} the oesophagus characterised by neuronal loss at the lower <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter. <b>Achalasia</b> is generally accepted as a multifactorial disorder with various genetic and environmental factors being risk-associated. Since genetic factors predisposing to achalasia have been poorly documented, we assessed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes mediating immune response and neuronal function contribute to achalasia susceptibility. METHODS: 391 SNPs covering 190 immune and 67 neuronal genes were genotyped in an exploratory cohort from Central Europe (589 achalasia patients, 794 healthy volunteers (HVs)). 24 SNPs (p 0. 2) were genotyped in the exploratory cohort. Genotype distributions of patients (1030) and HVs (1368) were compared using Cochran-Armitage trend test. RESULTS: The rs 1799724 SNP located between the lymphotoxin-α (LTA) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) genes {{was significantly associated with}} achalasia and withstood correction for testing multiple SNPs (p= 1. 17 E- 4, OR= 1. 41 (1. 18 to 1. 67)). SNPs in high LD with rs 1799724 were associated with achalasia. Three SNPs located in myosin- 5 B, adrenergic receptor-β- 2 and interleukin- 13 (IL 13) showed nominally significant association to achalasia that was strengthened by replication. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for rs 1799724 at the LTA/TNFα locus as a susceptibility factor for idiopathic achalasia. Additional studies are needed to dissect which genetic variants in the LTA/TNFα locus are disease-causing and confirm other variants as potential susceptibility factors for achalasia...|$|R
40|$|Oesophageal {{emptying}} can {{be assessed}} by radiographic and scintigraphic tests with radiation exposure or by multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (MII). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the applicability of MII for the assessment of <b>oesophageal</b> emptying in <b>achalasia</b> patients. In 10 achalasia patients, impedance tracings were scored independently by three observers after ingestion of a 100 -mL barium bolus. Bolus clearance time (BCT) and height of barium column were scored using fluoroscopic images acquired at 20 -s intervals. All patients showed a low baseline impedance level in the distal oesophagus. Air trapping in the proximal oesophagus was detected in nine patients. BCT on MII was similar to that on fluoroscopy in 40 - 70 % of the patients. Correlations between height of barium on fluoroscopy and fluid level on MII were poor to moderate at different time intervals. Concordance (Kendall's coefficient) between the three observers for assessment of fluid level on MII was 0. 31 (P = 0. 04) at 1 and 5 min, 0. 26 (P = 0. 08) at 10 and 0. 44 (P = 0. 01) at 15 min.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pneumatic {{dilatation}} of the oesophagus is a {{well established}} treatment for <b>achalasia.</b> <b>Oesophageal</b> perforation {{is the most serious}} complication that occurs in 2 % to 6 % of cases. The aim of this retrospective survey was to identify predictive risk factors for perforation in a consecutive series of 218 patients with achalasia. METHODS: Between 1983 and 1993, 270 pneumatic dilatations were performed in 218 patients. A Witzel dilator was used in 58 cases and a Rigiflex dilator in 212. Eight oesophageal perforations occurred (3 %). The clinical, radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and technical data for the eight perforated patients were compared with those of 30 patients randomly sampled among those without perforation. RESULTS: All perforations occurred during the first dilatation. Perforations were fewer during dilatations with the Rigiflex dilator than with the Witzel dilator (2. 4 % v 5. 2 %). Perforations were all located above the cardia, {{on the left side of}} the oesophagus. In a multivariate analysis, a small weight loss and a high amplitude of oesophageal contractions in the group of patients with perforations were predictive of complications (respectively, p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 026). A contraction amplitude higher than 70 cm H 2 O in the lower part of the oesophagus was observed in three of eight patients with perforations but was not seen in any of the 30 patients without perforation (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: This identification of risk factors should facilitate the choice between pneumatic dilatation or a surgical approach...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} results and health-related {{quality of life}} in patients undergoing surgery for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia.</b> Methods: Thirty-nine patients with achalasia (25 males, mean age 42 +/- 13 years) underwent open-Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication by the same surgeon. Long-term results were assessed by imaging, endoscopy, manometry, pH-metry, and Short Form 36 and Nottingham Health Profile questionnaires whenever applicable. Six patients were at radiological stage I, 20 were at stage II, 2 at stage III and 11 at stage IV. Dysphagia and regurgitation were scored according to the four-grade classification (1 = no symptoms; 4 = persistent symptoms). Pulmonary symptoms were present in six patients. Lower oesophageal pressure was 30 +/- 34 mmHg. Six patients had undergone previous pneumatodilation. Results: No procedure related mortality was recorded. Mean follow-up was 107 +/- 30 months (54 - 177). Preoperative to 5 -year postoperative mean decrement in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was 12. 3 +/- 8. 3 mmHg (P < 0. 001), in oesophageal width was 11. 5 +/- 7. 1 mm (P < 0. 001), in dysphagia 1. 8 +/- 0. 8 (P < 0. 01) and regurgitation 1. 4 +/- 0. 7 (P < 0. 01). Four patients presented relapse dysphagia and two of those were re-operated upon. Three patients developed acid reflux, which was satisfactorily treated with proton-pump inhibitors. Preoperative to 4 -year postoperative quality of life scores were available for 20 patients. Questionnaires showed a significant improvement (P < 0. 001) especially in all psychosocial domains, which were correlated with postoperative dysphagia score and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.

40|$|Abstract Allgrove {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder characterised by childhood onset, alacrima, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia,</b> adrenocortical insufficiency, neurological and occasionally autonomic involvement. Although the disease {{has been associated with}} mutations in the ALADIN gene on chromosome 12 q 13, it is genetically heterogeneous. The case we report is interesting because of its onset in adulthood, long duration of disease and prominent neurological dysfunctions. After the onset of neurological abnormalities the diagnosis went unrecognised for years until the patient presented for evaluation of dysphagia. The presence of achalasia with dysphagia, adrenal insufficiency, reduced tear production, optic atrophy and peripheral motor-sensory neuropathy with axonal loss led us to clinically diagnose Allgrove syndrome even though a genetic study showed no mutations in the ALADIN gene exons. The case we report shares many clinical features with Allgrove syndrome and, even with the limitations of a single case, underlines the variability in this syndrome and the need for appropriate investigations along with a multidisciplinary approach...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although the laparoscopic {{approach}} to <b>oesophageal</b> myotomy for <b>achalasia</b> {{is associated with}} reduced early postoperative morbidity compared with the open approach, most published reports describe relatively short-term follow up. For this reason, in a prospective cohort study, we determined the longer-term outcome for patients with uncomplicated achalasia who underwent a laparoscopic myotomy. In addition, we sought to identify preoperative factors predicting a good postoperative outcome. Methods: The outcome for 167 patients who underwent a laparoscopic cardiomyotomy and anterior partial fundoplication at one of two teaching hospitals was determined. All patients underwent preoperative assessment with a contrast swallow radiology, gastroscopy and oesophageal manometry. Patients also underwent objective symptom evaluation before and after surgery using various outcome scales to determine dysphagia, reflux symptoms, side-effects and overall satisfaction with the clinical outcomes. Patients were followed prospectively at yearly time points and data were managed on a computerized database. Postoperative objective investigations were undertaken if clinically indicated. Results: Median operating time was 78 min (range, 30 – 210 min). Most patients left the hospital within 72 h of surgery. Surgery {{was associated with a}} 5 % complication rate and a 4 % rate of conversion to open surgery. Five per cent of patients required a subsequent intervention during follow up. Over longer-term follow up (5 years or longer), 77 % of patients had either no or minimal symptoms. At 1, 3 and 5 years, 96, 93 and 97 % of patients indicated that they thought that they had made the correct decision to undergo surgery, although men consistently fared worse on their reported dysphagia outcome across a range of measures. Conclusion: Laparoscopic myotomy with anterior partial fundoplication achieves a good outcome for patients undergoing treatment of achalasia. Male patients do not perceive their outcome to be optimal in comparison with females but in the long term, they do not regret proceeding.

40|$|Aspects of {{mechanical}} dysphagia Assessment, treatment and consequences Jan Persson, M. D. Department of surgery, Institute of Clinical sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden ABSTRACT Background: Dysphagia {{is a symptom}} that negatively impacts patients’ quality of life. In the present thesis, aspects of dysphagia were explored in patients with primary achalasia and in patients diagnosed with cancers of the oesophagus or of the gastro-oesophageal junction. Aims: To validate commonly used dysphagia scores for malignant strictures of the oesophagus; to evaluate surgical and conservative treatments against primary achalasia, as well as evaluate stent treatments for dysphagia in advanced oesophageal cancer; and to describe and evaluate body composition, sarcopenia, and physical performance before and during follow-up after resection surgery in patients with oesophageal cancer. Methods and results: Paper I – A randomized controlled trial was performed in which laparoscopic myotomy was compared to endoscopic dilatation for achalasia-associated dysphagia, using treatment failure as the primary variable. At the five-year follow-up, {{there was a significant}} difference in favour of the surgical approach with fewer treatment failures. Both dysphagia and QoL were better in the operated group at three years, although these differences diminished at five years. Treatment costs in the operated group were significantly higher. Paper II – A validation of scales for assessment of dysphagia due to malignancy was made in patients with cancer of the oesophagus. Self-reported dysphagia from the Watson score, Goldschmid score and the Ogilvie score was compared to a food diary and to the already validated QoL questionnaire, QLQ-OG 25. All scores had good reliability, and the Ogilvie score and QLQ-OG 25 had the strongest correlation. Paper III – A randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the potential difference in stent migration between a conventional semi-covered stent, and a fully covered stent of a newer design, in palliative treatment of dysphagia due to malignancy. The primary variable was the frequency of migration > 20 mm. There were no significant differences in any of the studied variables of dysphagia, QoL or re-intervention frequency, indicating that a fully-covered stent of a newer design is similar to a conventional semi-covered stent with regard to migration. Paper IV – Body composition and sarcopenia were investigated in a prospectively collected patient cohort with cancer of the oesophagus who were planned for surgery with curative intent. Prior to surgery, a majority of the patients displayed deteriorated physical performance; almost two of five were judged to be severely malnourished in spite of a normal BMI, and one of five had sarcopenia. Muscle mass continued to deteriorate for at least three months post-operatively. High physical performance, female sex and a high global QoL score positively predicted overall survival. Conclusions: The Ogilvie score and the dysphagia module in QLQ-OG 25 can be selected for assessment of dysphagia due to malignancy. In primary achalasia, laparoscopic myotomy gives a better long-term result and can thus be recommended as a primary treatment method. A fully-covered stent of a newer design is comparable to a conventional semi-covered stent with regard to migration. Patients with potentially curable oesophageal cancer have a high pre-operative prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia in spite of normal average BMI. Surgery has a long-lasting catabolic impact. This highlights the importance of optimal pre- and post-operative nutritional support in oesophageal cancer.

Methods: Clinical and demographic information from 228 consecutive patients who had surgery between 1980 and 1992 was extracted from hospital files. Survival status and dates of death were obtained from census offices. Causes of death were obtained from public registries and compared with those of the general population. Symptoms were assessed by means of a questionnaire and endoscopy results were scrutinized. Results: Among 226 patients who could be traced, 182 of 184 survivors were contacted and the cause of death established for 41 of 42 patients. At a median follow-up of 18. 3 years, almost 90 per cent of patients were satisfied with the treatment. Four had developed squamous cell oesophageal carcinoma 2, 8, 13 and 18 years after surgery, one of whom was still alive. The standardized mortality ratio for oesophageal carcinoma was significantly higher than expected in men.

All 22 patients, whether surgically or medically retreated, achieved satisfactory control of dysphagia and reflux symptoms. Conclusions: In the long term, insufficient results strictly related to Heller—Dor failure, always due to reflux oesophagitis, were recorded in 15 / 173 patients (8. 7 %) although it is questionable whether reflux oesophagitis appearing after more than 15 years {{is due to the}} Dor incompetence or to ageing. In sigmoid achalasia, oesophagectomy rather than myotomy should be taken into consideration in the first instance. In the long-term, surgery is the best definitive treatment for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Achalasia is {{a primary}} {{oesophageal}} motility disorder resulting from damage to the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus. Impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter and aperistalsis causes its cardinal symptoms of dysphagia, chest pain and reflux-type symptoms. Management is somewhat controversial, with options including systemic and local pharmacotherapy, dilatation and oesophagomyotomy. We review the presentation, investigation and management of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> and make an argument for primary surgical management. We performed a Medline search of the term 'achalasia', limiting the search to clinical trials and meta-analyses. We then selected articles based on their abstracts using four main criteria: previously unreported findings, previously unreported techniques, size of patient cohort and journal impact factor. References in selected articles were manually searched for other relevant articles. Achalasia has been managed {{using a variety of}} techniques including systemic and local pharmacotherapy, forced dilatation and oesophagomyotomy. Success rates vary widely between techniques. Mechanical disruption ofthe lower oesophageal sphincter is most successful. In achalasia, mechanical disruption of the lower oesophageal sphincter using forced dilatation or surgical myotomy offers the only realistic prospect of long-term symptom relief. Recent evidence suggests that previous medical treatment or dilatation makes oesophagomyotomy more difficult and increases the risk of complications. As the morbidity associated with surgery continues to decrease with improvements in minimal access techniques, the argument for primary management of achalasia with oesophagomyotomy becomes more compelling...|$|E
40|$|Megaoesophagus, or <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia,</b> is a neuromuscular {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} absence of peristalsis and flaccid dilatation of the oesophagus, resulting in the retention of ingesta in the dilated segment. The aetiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic (or primary) megaoesophagus are still poorly understood and very {{little is known about}} the genetic causes of megaoesophagus in humans. Attempts to develop animal models of this condition have been largely unsuccessful and although the ICRC/HiCri strain of mice spontaneously develop megaoesophagus, the underlying genetic cause remains unknown. In this report, we show that aged Rassf 1 a-null mice have an enhanced susceptibility to megaoesophagus compared with wild-type littermates (∼ 20 %vs. ∼ 2 % incidence respectively; P = 0. 01). Histological examination of the dilated oesophaguses shows a reduction in the numbers of nerve cells (both ganglia and nerve fibres) in the myenteric plexus of the dilated mid and lower oesophagus that was confirmed by S 100 immunohistochemistry. There was also a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and subsequent fibrosis of the myenteric plexus and the muscle layers. These appearances closely mimic the gross and histopathological findings in human cases of megaoesophagus/achalasia, thus demonstrating that this is a representative mouse model of the disease. Thus, we have identified a genetic cause of the development of megaoesophagus/achalasia that could be screened for in patients, and may eventually facilitate the development of therapies that could prevent further progression of the disease once it is diagnosed at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Peroral {{endoscopic}} myotomy {{has been}} developed to provide a less invasive treatment for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> compared to surgical cardiomyotomy. AIMS: To report our initial experience on feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of peroral endoscopic myotomy. METHODS: Eleven patients (eight women, mean age 32, range 24 - 58) underwent an attempt at peroral endoscopic myotomy under general anaesthesia. After submucosal injection, a mucosal entry into the oesophageal submucosa, and a tunnel extending to the oesophagogastric junction and beyond into the stomach were created (total mean length: 15 ± 1. 7 cm). Myotomy of the circular oesophageal and gastric muscle bundles was then achieved under direct vision (total mean length: 10. 2 ± 2. 8 cm). Haemostatic clips were used to close the mucosal entry. The Eckardt Score and manometry were {{used to evaluate the}} results. RESULTS: Peroral endoscopic myotomy could be completed in 10 out of 11 patients (91 %). Mean procedure time was 100. 7 min (range 75 - 140 min). No major complication occurred. Clinical success was achieved in all patients at 1 -month follow-up (Eckardt Score 7. 1 vs. 1. 1, p= 0). Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure decreased from 45. 1 to 16. 9 mmHg (p= 0). CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience with peroral endoscopic myotomy shows its safety and efficacy in the treatment of achalasia. Further studies are warranted to assess the long-term efficacy and to compare peroral endoscopic myotomy with other treatment modalities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe optimal anti-reflux {{procedure}} after Heller cardiomyotomy for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> remains unclear. The {{most commonly}} used procedure is the anterior partial fundoplication according to Dor, although during recent years the posterior counterpart (Toupet) has become popular. MethodsPatients with newly diagnosed achalasia and referred for cardiomyotomy were randomised to receive either an anterior or partial posterior fundoplication following a classical cardiomyotomy. The effect of surgery was assessed during the first postoperative year by Eckardt scores, EORTC QLQ-OES 18 scores and HRQL questionnaires. Timed barium oesophagogram (TBO) and ambulatory 24 -h pH monitoring were performed to determine oesophageal emptying {{and the degree of}} reflux control, respectively. ResultsForty-two patients were randomised into Dor (n =  20) and Toupet (n =  22) groups. Eckardt scores improved dramatically with both procedures, but the EORTC QLQ-OES 18 (functional scales) scores revealed significantly better relative improvements in the Toupet group compared to the Dor repair (P =  0. 044). Corresponding advantages in favour of Toupet were observed postoperatively in the percentage of oesophageal emptying at TBO (P =  0. 011 in height and P =  0. 018 in area), an effect not observed in the Dor group. There were no other significant differences recorded between the study groups concerning HRQL evaluations and objective assessment of gastro-oesophageal acid reflux. ConclusionsA partial posterior fundoplication after cardiomyotomy seems to achieve more improvement in oesophageal emptying and EORTC QLQ-OES 18 functional scale scores than the anterior fundoplication. Otherwise no differences between the two anti-reflux repairs were noted. Trial registration numberClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01933373...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia</b> is well-recognized but {{relatively}} rare in children, occasionally appearing as the “triple A” syndrome (with adrenal insufficiency and alacrima). Treatment modalities, as in adult practice, are not curative, often needing further interventions and spurring {{the search for}} better management. The outcome for syndromic variants is unknown. We sought to define the efficacy of treatments for children with achalasia with and without triple A syndrome. METHODS : We conducted a retrospective analysis of presentation and outcomes for 42 children with achalasia presenting over three decades to a major pediatric referral center. Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS : We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The median overall age at diagnosis was 10. 8 years and median follow-up 1593 days. Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65 %), while initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by myotomy in 17 (85 %). Ten out of 35 patients who underwent myotomy required a repeat myotomy (29 %). Patients with triple A syndrome developed symptoms earlier, but had delayed diagnosis, were more underweight at diagnosis and at last follow up. Questionnaire results suggested a significant long term deleterious impact {{on the quality of}} life of children and their families. CONCLUSION : Many children with achalasia relapse after initial treatment, undergoing multiple, different procedures, despite which symptoms persist and impact on quality of life. Symptoms develop earlier in patients with triple A syndrome, but the diagnosis is delayed and this has substantial nutritional impact. [URL] and Child Healt...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Intrasphincteric {{injection}} of botulinum toxin (Botx) {{has been proposed}} as treatment for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>achalasia.</b> However, the predictors of response and optimal dose remain unclear.  AIMS—To compare the effect of different doses of Botx and to identify predictors of response.  PATIENTS/METHODS—A total of 118  achalasic patients were randomised to receive one of three doses of Botx in a single injection: 50  U (n= 40), 100  U (n= 38), and 200  U (n= 40). Of those who received 100  U, responsive patients were reinjected with an identical dose after 30  days. Clinical and manometric assessments were performed at baseline, 30  days after the initial {{injection of}} botulinum toxin, {{and at the end}} of follow up (mean 12  months; range 7 - 24 months).  RESULTS—Thirty days after the initial injection, 82 % of patients were considered responders without a clear dose related effect. At the end of follow up however, relapse of symptoms was evident in 19 % of patients who received two injections of 100  U compared with 47 % and 43 % in the 50  U and 200  U groups, respectively. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients in the 100 × 2 U group were more likely to remain in remission at any time (p< 0. 04), with 68 % (95 % CI 59 - 83) still in remission at 24  months. In a multiple adjusted model, response to Botx was independently predicted by the occurrence of vigorous achalasia (odds ratio 3. 3) and the 100 × 2 U regimen (odds ratio 3. 2).  CONCLUSIONS—Two injections of 100  U of Botx 30  days apart appeared to be the most effective therapeutic schedule. The presence of vigorous achalasia was the principal determinant of the response to Botx.    Keywords: achalasia; botulinum toxin; oesophagus; dose ranging stud...|$|E
