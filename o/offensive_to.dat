5|$|Napoleon {{arrived in}} Paris on 20 March and governed {{for a period}} now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June the armed forces {{available}} to him had reached 200,000, {{and he decided to}} go on the <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.|$|E

The Soviet Army launched a series of major <b>offensives</b> <b>to</b> attempt to destroy their forces, but they were unable to engage most of Massoud's men.|$|R
5|$|Sumiyoshi was {{informed}} by Hyakutake's {{staff of the}} postponement of the <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> 24 October, {{but was unable to}} contact Nakaguma to inform him of the delay. Thus, at dusk on 23 October, two battalions of Nakaguma's 4th Infantry Regiment and the nine tanks of the 1st Independent Tank Company launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses {{at the mouth of the}} Matanikau.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} Sadat, {{in the face}} of protests from his senior commanders, ordered an <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on the Syrians. The resulting offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives. This gave the Israelis the initiative to launch a counteroffensive.|$|E

5|$|A new forward {{headquarters}}, Alsos Forward North (AFwdN), {{was opened}} at Aachen, and on 8 February the Alsos Mission reopened its forward headquarters in Strasbourg as Alsos Forward South (AFwdS). In March, the U.S. Twelfth Army Group launched Operation Lumberjack, an <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> clear the Germans {{west of the}} Rhine. Pash, who was promoted to colonel on 6 March, led an Alsos Mission detachment into Cologne on 7 March, but little additional information was found.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} Army Group North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (June–August 1944) against Army Group Centre. The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic <b>Offensive</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E
5|$|By October 1950, the United Nations (UN) {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of the}} Pusan Perimeter in the extreme south of Korea and begun an aggressive northward advance towards the Sino-Korean border, chasing the retreating Korean People's Army (KPA). The US 1st Cavalry Division entered Pyongyang on 19 October, while the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) were rushing towards the Yalu River in all directions. As part of the Thanksgiving <b>Offensive</b> <b>to</b> end the war, Major General Frank W. Milburn, commander of the US I Corps, ordered the ROK 1st Infantry Division to secure the Sup'ung Dam on the Yalu River by advancing through Unsan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network {{had been reduced to}} air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E

5|$|Carey and Helford co-wrote {{the pilot}} episode together. Helford had {{expected}} The Drew Carey Show to air at 8:30pm. When ABC placed {{the show in}} the 7:30 pm slot, Helford agreed to soften the language in the pilot. An executive from Standards and Practices had asked for nine words deemed <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> {{be removed from the}} script, as well as a mention of Jack Daniel's and a line that implied one of the characters was going to buy and use drugs.|$|E
5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused {{more and more on}} the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|During mid-1944 the Imperial Japanese Army's General Staff {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} the garrisons of the southern Philippines and Borneo ahead of an expected Allied <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> liberate these areas. As part of this effort, the 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th and 58th Independent Mixed Brigades were ordered to be formed for service with the Southern Expeditionary Army Group during June. Aside from the 58th Independent Mixed Brigade, which was formed by converting an existing unit, these new brigades were to be organised in forward areas from personnel shipped from Japan. Upon formation, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade {{was assigned to the}} Borneo Defence Force (BDF).|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of rapid and {{successful}} campaigns starting in 262, he crossed the Euphrates and recovered Carrhae and Nisibis. He then took the <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> the heartland of Persia, and arrived at the walls of its capital Ctesiphon. The city withstood the short siege but Odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of Roman lands occupied by the Persians {{since the beginning of}} their invasions in 252. Odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself King of Kings, crowning his son Hairan I as co-king. By 263, Odaenathus was in effective control of the Levant, Mesopotamia and Anatolia's eastern region.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was <b>offensive</b> <b>to</b> the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E
