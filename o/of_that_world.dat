5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>world</b> which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|The two {{examples}} witness the chthonic {{nature of these}} mythological creatures: a hero can enter the chthonic space and discover the secret <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>world,</b> {{but he is not}} allowed to relate that secret to other humans. Both the ala and Baba Yaga {{can be traced back to}} an older concept of a female demonic divinity: the snakelike mistress of the underworld.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{was concerned about the}} relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and wanted {{to try to make the}} story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>world</b> to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw in the first half of Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron.|$|E

25|$|Rhodes shot to fame after South Africa's fifth {{game of the}} World Cup, against Pakistan on the 8 March 1992 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. South Africa batted first, scoring 211 off 50 overs. Pakistan's innings {{was reduced}} to 36 overs because of rain interruptions, with the target revised from 212 to 194 runs. Inzamam-ul-Haq and Pakistan captain Imran Khan resumed the innings when play was restarted. With the score at 135/2 Inzamam, {{who was at the}} time on 48, set off for a run but was turned back by Khan. The ball had rolled out towards Rhodes who ran in from {{backward}} point, gathered the ball and raced the retreating Inzamam to the wicket. Rhodes, with ball in hand, dived full length to break the stumps and effect the run out. The run out, the subject of a famous photograph, is still considered one of the more spectacular feats <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>World</b> Cup and the defining moment of Rhodes' career. Pakistan's innings faltered from then on, eventually finishing on 173/8 with South Africa winning by twenty runs.|$|E

500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen.

The characters are not looking for some way to burst out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>world.</b> Instead, they are {{trying to find a way}} to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E

Kawai originally wanted to use Bulgarian folk music singers, but used Japanese folk singers instead.
