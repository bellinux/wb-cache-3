5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved}} in their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the defeat}} {{ultimately}} fell on Alcibiades, and his enemies used {{the opportunity to}} attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for Antiochus's mistake. Diodorus reports that, {{in addition to his}} mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by his enemies. According to Anthony Andrewes, professor of ancient history, the extravagant hopes that his successes of the previous summer had created were a decisive element in his downfall. Consequently, Alcibiades condemned himself to exile. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> Alcibiades but also his allies like Thrasybulus, Theramenes and Critias. These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time, and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later, after their complete defeat at Aegospotami.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory is a product <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the era's widespread mistrust of governments and {{the popularity of the}} extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces.

5|$|Muirchertach Ua Briain was one {{of three}} sons of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1086), a man who secured control of the Kingdom of Munster in the 1060s before gaining the high-kingship of Ireland less than a decade later. In 1175, in an act of overlordship over the Kingdom of Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain {{appointed}} Muirchertach Ua Briain King of Dublin, following a precedent set by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072), a previous claimant to the Irish high-kingship who had done the same to his own eldest son, Murchad (died 1070), in 1052. When Toirdelbach Ua Briain finally died in 1086, his sons bitterly contested the kingship of Munster before Muirchertach Ua Briain succeeded in securing it for himself. By 1091, the latter appears to have regained control of the Dublin, only to lose it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095), who united it with the Kingdom of the Isles. Gofraid's reign in Ireland was short-lived, as Muirchertach Ua Briain forced him from Dublin in 1094. After the Gofraid's death the following year, Muirchertach Ua Briain appointed his own nephew, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), as King of the Isles. Uí Briain influence in the Isles was similarly short-lived, however, as Domnall mac Taidc was apparently forced from the region, and Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway seized control <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the Isles, but perhaps even Dublin itself, before falling in battle in 1103. Later in 1111, Domnall mac Taidc temporarily seized the kingship of the Isles in an act that may have been opposed by his aforesaid uncle. The reasons for Domnall mac Taidc's exit from the Isles are uncertain. Although he may have been forcibly ejected by the Islesmen, he may well have returned to Ireland to take advantage of Muirchertach Ua Briain's rapidly failing health.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E
5|$|The genus Alcelaphus emerged about 4.4 {{million years}} ago in a clade whose other members were Damalops, Numidocapra, Rabaticeras, Megalotragus, Oreonagor, and Connochaetes. An {{analysis}} using phylogeographic patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of Alcelaphus in eastern Africa. Alcelaphus quickly radiated across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the hirola). Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 {{million years ago}} – one to the north and the other to the south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably {{as a result of the}} expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke's, Swayne's, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest. The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein's and red hartebeest. These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population—a refugium—in eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna.|$|E

5|$|Yet {{again in}} Spring 1992, the CSU and UC systems were facing {{another round of}} severe budget cuts and {{dramatic}} student fee increases by the state government. Still a second time, SDSU President Thomas Day took the same deep and narrow approach for budget cuts for SDSU, but this time proposed elimination <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> full time faculty professors, but of entire majors such as Aerospace Engineering. In and attempt to alleviate fears of students in those majors, a large meeting by President Day was planned in the student center with hundreds of students and teachers. However, meeting quickly turned angry and chaotic with an overcapacity crowd pressing against the glass windows outside. Following the meeting, students feeling betrayed a 2nd time after 1991, about a dozen students held a temporary occupation of President Day's office. This occupation led to a 24 hour vigil {{in front of the}} Administration building, summer student bus trips to the state legislature in Sacramento, large campus student voter registration drive, and further student marches and protests in the Fall 1992. Under heavy student, teacher, and public pressure, the conclusion of these events ended with CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz eventually reversing President Day's deep and narrow approach, saving the majors and programs in Fall 1992.|$|E
