The company has sent Watson to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients. The medical facility will utilize Watson's ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase {{the accuracy of the}} treatment process. [...] "Cleveland Clinic's collaboration with IBM is exciting because it <b>offers</b> <b>us</b> the opportunity to teach Watson to 'think' in ways that have the potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine", said C. Martin Harris, MD, chief information officer of Cleveland Clinic.|$|E

2500|$|In 610, Heraclius, an Armenian, revolted against Phocas {{and killed}} him, {{crowning}} himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. He {{then tried to}} negotiate peace with Khosrow II by sending diplomats to his court. Khosrow, however, rejected their offer and said: [...] "That kingdom belongs to me, and I shall enthrone Maurice's son, Theodosius, as emperor. , he went and took the rule without our order and now <b>offers</b> <b>us</b> our own treasure as gifts. But I shall not stop until I have him in my hands." [...] Khosrow then had the diplomats executed.|$|E

2500|$|... all {{mediation}} is remediation. We are not claiming {{this as an}} {{a priori}} truth, but rather arguing that at this extended historical moment, all current media function as remediators and that remediation <b>offers</b> <b>us</b> a means of interpreting the work of earlier media as well. Our culture conceives of each medium or constellation of media as it responds to, redeploys, competes with, and reforms other media. In the first instance, we may think of something like a historical progression, of newer media remediating older ones and in particular of digital media remediating their predecessors. But ours is a genealogy of affiliations, not a linear history, and in this genealogy, older media can also remediate newer ones. (p. 55) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the visible}} {{geometry}} of courtly ceremony, the Folio version <b>offers</b> <b>us</b> a bold Queen Margaret and an exuberant king who stands erect while the visibly subordinated nobles kneel before them. In {{contrast to the}} modest queen seated beside the king surrounded by standing nobles, in this text at the equivalent moment, we have an assertive queen standing upright with her monarch, visibly subordinating the kneeling, obedient lords. Distinct theatrical representations of psychological and political tensions distinguish the {{two versions of the}} passage. Both texts [...] "work" [...] by leading an audience through an elaborate ceremonial display fraught with symbolic gestures of emotional attachment, sanctification, regal authority, and feudal obedience, but each displays a distinct pattern of language and coded gestures. Such fine-tuning of dramatic themes and actions are staples of professional theatrical writing.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics have}} been less kind however, arguing that if the later plays show a skilled and {{confident}} writer exploring serious issues of the human heart, Two Gentlemen represents the initial, primarily unsuccessful attempt to do likewise. In 1921, for example, J. Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller-Couch, in their edition of the play for the Cambridge Shakespeare, famously stated that after hearing Valentine offer Silvia to Proteus [...] "one's impulse, upon this declaration, is to remark that there are, by this time, no gentlemen in Verona." [...] H.B. Charlton, writing in 1938, argues that [...] "clearly, Shakespeare's first attempt to make romantic comedy had only succeeded {{so far as it}} had unexpectedly and inadvertently made romance comic." [...] Another such argument is provided by Norman Sanders in 1968; [...] "because the play reveals a relatively unsure dramatist and many effects managed with a tiro's lack of expertise, it <b>offers</b> <b>us</b> an opportunity to see more clearly {{than anywhere else in the}} canon what were to become characteristic techniques. It stands as an 'anatomie' or show-through version, as it were, of Shakespeare's comic art." [...] Kurt Schlueter, on the other hand, argues that critics have been too harsh on the play precisely because the later plays are so much superior. He suggests that when looking at Shakespeare's earlier works, scholars put too much emphasis on how they fail to measure up to the later works, rather than looking at them for their own intrinsic merits; [...] "we should not continue the practice of holding his later achievements against him when dealing with his early beginnings." ...|$|E
