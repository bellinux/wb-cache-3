25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered the lives of <b>our</b> <b>sons</b> and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives.

500|$|A British {{parliamentary}} motion {{put forward}} by Labour MP Kate Hoey in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims {{on the anniversary of}} the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the Herald branding it a racist [...] "Rhodie motion" [...] intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters. Dumiso Dabengwa, a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher Mutsvangwa, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration [...] "a provocation... means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to <b>our</b> <b>sons</b> and daughters in and outside the country." [...] ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts [...] "civilians get caught up in cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors", and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.|$|E
