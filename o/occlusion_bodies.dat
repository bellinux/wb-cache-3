40|$|Substitution of granulin {{from the}} Trichoplusia ni {{granulosis}} virus (TnGV) for polyhedrin of the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcMNPV) yielded a few very large (2 to 5 μm) cuboidal inclusions in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells. These polyhedra lacked the beveled edges characteristic of wild-type AcMNPV polyhedra, contained fractures, and occluded few virions. Placing a nuclear localization signal (KRKK) in granulin directed more granulin to the nucleus and resulted in more structurally uniform cuboidal inclusions in which no virions were observed. A granulin-polyhedrin chimera produced tetrahedral occlusions with more virions than granulin inclusions but many fewer than wild-type polyhedra. Despite the unusual structure of the granulin and granulin-polyhedrin inclusions, they interacted with AcMNPV p 10 fibrillar structures and electron-dense spacers that are precursors of the polyhedral calyx. The change in inclusion shape obtained with the granulin-polyhedrin chimera demonstrates that the primary amino acid sequence affects <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> shape, but the large cuboidal inclusions formed by granulin indicate that the amino acid sequence {{is not the only}} determinant. The failure of granulin or the granulin-polyhedrin chimera to properly occlude AcMNPV virions suggests that specific interactions occur between polyhedrin and other viral proteins which facilitate normal virion <b>occlusion</b> and <b>occlusion</b> <b>body</b> assembly and shape in baculoviruses...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to improve}} the dataset {{foundation}} for pedestrian attribute recognition in real surveillance scenarios. Recognition of human attributes, such as gender, and clothes types, has great prospects in real applications.

Existing human attribute datasets are collected from various sources or an integration of pedestrian re-identification datasets. Such heterogeneous collection poses a big challenge on developing high quality fine-grained attribute recognition algorithms. Furthermore, human attribute recognition are generally severely affected by environmental or contextual factors, such as viewpoints, <b>occlusions</b> and <b>body</b> parts, while existing attribute datasets barely care about them. To tackle these problems, we build a Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) dataset from real multi-camera surveillance scenarios with long term collection, where data samples are annotated with not only fine-grained human attributes but also environmental and contextual factors.
