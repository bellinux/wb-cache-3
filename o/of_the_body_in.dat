5|$|Cognitive externalism is a {{very broad}} {{collection}} of views that suggests {{the role of the}} environment, of tools, of development, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> fleshing out cognition. Embodied cognition, the extended mind, and enactivism are good examples.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body).</b> <b>In</b> appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E

5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts {{from which the}} ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, {{and some of these}} are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E

5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> (<b>In</b> tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} forty years, fitness {{has evolved into}} a popular {{sportive}} practice that has been accompanied by fundamental social and economic changes. Not surprisingly, <b>the</b> fit <b>body</b> is therefore often characterized as a post-Fordist <b>body.</b> Assuming that <b>the</b> fit <b>body</b> represents <b>the</b> concurrence <b>of</b> being fit and keeping fit, the article de-scribes <b>the</b> hegemonic position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fit <b>body</b> <b>in</b> post-Fordist conditions. Furthermore, with reference to <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebensreformbewegung (“life reform movement”), it outlines a non-linear and partial genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fit <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> so doing, it points to the continuities and transformations between concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “fit” <b>body</b> <b>in</b> Fordist and post-Fordist discourses and practices...|$|R

5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} ventral {{and a little}} behind {{the front of the}} body.

Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>In</b> the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice.
