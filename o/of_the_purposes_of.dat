Only high-ranking officials knew that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> some of the camps, known as extermination camps (or death camps), was mass murder of the undesirable minorities, primarily the Jews; officially the prisoners were used in enterprises such as production of synthetic rubber, as was the case of a plant owned by IG Farben, whose laborers came from Auschwitz III camp, or Monowitz. Laborers from concentration camps were literally worked to death. in what was known as extermination through labor.|$|E
25|$|His next {{work was}} {{published}} in 1933 titled The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness; he attempts an accommodation with behaviorism by viewing sensations through their physical mechanisms. In this Boring expresses his monist physicalism perspective, similar to operationalism’s emphasis on measurement {{in order to understand}} the meaning of concepts. Boring himself was surprised by his view being in direct opposition to his deeply respected mentor Titchener. However Titchener was dead by this time and Boring was now free to express his views. The mentalist and dualist perspective of Titchener seemed insecure to Boring, he focused on a physical brain rather than the abstract mind. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> this book was try to clarify such complex terms as consciousness and sensation, questions that had been plaguing him since his automobile accident. Boring wanted to define what these phenomena actually meant physically.|$|E

They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming consent form.

The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's Privacy Act by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> filming {{and found that the}} coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> bondage in BDSM is to {{restrain}} a person (typically called the bottom) in a BDSM position. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve {{the use of}} a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the spread eagle, with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the hogtie, which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as bondage cuffs are recommended for this); the balltie, which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the crotch rope, which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the reverse prayer position (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an over-arm tie, in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.|$|E

The CTW found that it was an effective tool in teaching children letters and numbers and that it effectively attracted children's attention. It also provided evidence, as writer Robert W. Morrow reported, that children were able to [...] "endure enormous amounts of repetition". According to Morrow, the CTW's generalization from this study, which was later supported by outside studies, was that although repetition was an effective teaching method, repeated exposure [...] "determined instructional effectiveness". [...] "The J commercial" [...] was a part of CTW's promotional film about Sesame Street and was used to demonstrate its teaching style to the press.|$|E
