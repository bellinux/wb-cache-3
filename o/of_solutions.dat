If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only a finite number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> may be possible.

Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> {{by the size of the}} equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} the number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> to {{different types of}} Apollonius' problem belongs {{to the field of}} enumerative geometry. The general number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number <b>of</b> <b>solutions.</b> For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>solutions.</b> If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity <b>of</b> <b>solutions.</b> If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds to a pair <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself {{a solution to the}} Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number <b>of</b> <b>solutions</b> from zero to eight.|$|E
