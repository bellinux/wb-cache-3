5|$|Most {{people who}} stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E

The east-northeast row today consists of five stones and is 23.2 metres long. The southern row consists of five stones and is 27.2 metres long. The west-southwest row consists of four stones and is 13 metres long.|$|E

25|$|Passion: An Essay on Personality is a {{philosophical}} inquiry into human nature by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. The book explores {{the individual and}} his relation to society, asking how <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> {{to an understanding of}} self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world {{but at the same time}} to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.|$|E
25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, as it must, {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, {{it seems to me}} an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E

25|$|According to existentialism, {{each man}} and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; {{life is not}} {{determined}} by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason {{as a source of}} meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of anxiety and dread, felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises only after <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> to existence.|$|E
25|$|Cellular automata {{are often}} {{simulated}} on a finite grid {{rather than an}} infinite one. In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane. The obvious problem with finite grids is {{how to handle the}} cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighborhoods differently for these cells. One could say that they have fewer neighbors, but then one would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a toroidal arrangement: when one goes off the top, <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when one goes off the left, <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling, and in the field of partial differential equations is sometimes referred to as periodic boundary conditions.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a torus (doughnut shape). Universes of other dimensions are handled similarly. This solves boundary problems with neighborhoods, but another advantage is that it is easily programmable using modular arithmetic functions. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell xit is {x'i−1t−1, x'i't−1, x'i+1t−1}, where t is the time step (vertical), and i is the index (horizontal) in one generation.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> across fake {{sovereign}} {{coins in}} which the gold is replaced or alloyed with a substitute metal to look like gold. For example, a few fake sovereigns appeared in circulation which were produced with 9 carat gold instead of the correct 22 carat composition. Such fakes can be relatively easily detected by measurement and weighing using jewellers' scales. Experienced coin dealers will generally detect such fakes immediately, as they are obviously underweight or have the wrong size or thickness, as well as often having minor differences or lack of sharpness in the design details. It is more common to come across counterfeit copies of larger gold coins such as the Krugerrand, which are easier and more economical to copy.|$|E

25|$|Some {{countries}} also impose {{legal requirements}} on the packaging of tobacco products. For example, {{in the countries}} of the European Union, Turkey, Australia and South Africa, cigarette packs must be prominently labeled with the health risks associated with smoking. Canada, Australia, Thailand, Iceland and Brazil have also imposed labels upon cigarette packs warning smokers of the effects, and they include graphic images of the potential health effects of smoking. Cards are also inserted into cigarette packs in Canada. There are sixteen of them, and only <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> in a pack. They explain different methods of quitting smoking. Also, in the United Kingdom, {{there have been a number}} of graphic NHS advertisements, one showing a cigarette filled with fatty deposits, as if the cigarette is symbolizing the artery of a smoker.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of present-day fire temples {{is always the}} same. There are no indigenous sources older than the 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed {{that they had a}} standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and {{it is possible that the}} temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. (Stausberg, 2004:175,405) On entry <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place. Off to the side of this (or sometimes a floor level up or down) the devotee enters an anteroom smaller than the hall he/she has just passed through. Connected to this anteroom, or enclosed within it, but not visible from the hall, is the innermost sanctum (in Zoroastrian terminology, the atashgah, literally 'place of the fire' (Boyce, 1993:669-670) in which the actual fire-altar stands.|$|E
25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.|$|E

25|$|During a barn {{dance the}} night before the duel, Anna slips Foy a Mickey. After leaving the dance, Albert and Anna kiss before heading home. Upon {{breaking}} out of jail and murdering the sheriff, Lewis witnesses the kiss and reports it to Clinch. On the day of the duel, Foy arrives late and goes into convulsions from the laxative he had unknowingly drunk. Albert, who has decided that Louise is not worth fighting for, once again forfeits the duel. He retires to the saloon, but Clinch arrives and demands to know who kissed his wife. When no <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> forward, Clinch shoots a nearby cowboy (Ryan Reynolds). He reveals that Anna is his wife and threatens to continue killing unless his wife's lover duels him at noon the next day. Clinch later forces Anna to reveal Albert's name and then prepares to have sex with her, but she knocks him unconscious and escapes.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} design used during this great period owes {{much of its}} {{interest}} to the now obsolete custom of directly employing the craftsman and his men, instead of the present-day habit of giving the work to a contractor. It is easy to trace how those bands of carvers traveled about from church to church. In one district the designer would employ a particular form and arrangement of vine leaf, while in another adjoining quite a different style repeatedly appears. The general scheme was of course planned by one mastermind, but the carrying out of each section, each part, each detail, was left to the individual workman. Hence that variety of treatment, that endless diversity, which gives a charm and interest to Gothic art, unknown in more symmetrical epochs. The Gothic craftsman appreciated the cardinal fact that in design beautiful detail does not necessarily ensure a beautiful composition, and subordinated the individual part to the general effect. He also often carved in situ, a practice seldom if ever followed in the present day. Here and there <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> across the work of long years ago still unfinished. A half-completed bench-end, a fragment of screen left plain, clearly show that sometimes at least the church was the workshop.|$|E

25|$|The {{criminal}} judges {{serve at}} a penal court. These courts (mahkeme(ler)) are separated into ağır ceza (assize court), asliye ceza (penal court of first instance), and sulh ceza (penal court of peace). The civil judges serve at civil courts of first instance or at civil courts of peace (sulh or asliye hukuk mahkemeleri), while administrative judges serve in administrative courts (idari mahkemeler).

After the Constitutional amendment which took place 2010, the composition of The High Council of Judges and Prosecutors was completely changed. It currently consists of 22 members. Ten members out of 22 are elected among the judges and prosecutors by their colleagues working in first instance courts. While five members are supreme judges elected by other supreme judges, four members of High Council are appointed among lawyers and law professors by the President of Republic and <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> from Judicial Academy.
