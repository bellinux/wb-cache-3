He is a tall, strong young man, devoted to Tina. [...] "His healthy <b>open</b> <b>face</b> and robust limbs were after an excellent pattern for everyday wear". (By the time he appears at the beginning of [...] "The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton" [...] he has become [...] "an excellent old gentleman, who smoked very long pipes and preached very short sermons".) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1668 Penn {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London after writing a {{follow-up}} tract entitled The Sandy Foundation Shaken. The Bishop of London ordered that Penn be held indefinitely until he publicly recanted his written statements. The official charge was publication {{without a license}} but the real crime was blasphemy, as signed in a warrant by King Charles II. Placed in solitary confinement in an unheated cell and threatened with a life sentence, Penn was being accused of denying the Trinity, though this was a misinterpretation Penn himself refuted in the essay Innocency with her <b>open</b> <b>face,</b> presented by way of Apology for the book entitled the Sandy Foundation Shaken, where he himself proceeded to prove the Godhead of Christ. Penn said the rumour had been [...] "maliciously insinuated" [...] by detractors who {{wanted to create a}} bad reputation to Quakers. Later, he stated that what he really denied were the Catholic interpretations of this theological topic, and the use of unbiblical concepts to explain it. Penn expressly confessed he believed in the Holy Three {{as well as in the}} divinity of Christ. In 1668 in a letter to the anti-Quaker minister Jonathan Clapham, [...] Penn wrote: [...] "Thou must not, reader, from my querying thus, conclude we do deny (as he hath falsely charged us) those glorious Three, which bear record in heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit; neither the infinity, eternity and divinity of Jesus Christ; for that we know he is the mighty God." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the casting}} team had {{successfully}} cast the actors who were playing Sam's brothers, {{they already knew}} what facial attributes they needed for Sam to create a similar family resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth has commented, [...] "we'd decided on Steve [...] and Ross [...] and we knew the sort of round, <b>open</b> <b>face</b> we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her." [...] The actress, {{a graduate of the}} Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of Albert Square in front of the characters Den and Angie Watts. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, [...] "who knows, one day she might be the show's star". Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four. On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors Michelle Gayle and Sid Owen, who were already on the EastEnders cast as Hattie Tavernier and Ricky Butcher respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend. According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of [...] "You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance. Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, [...] "they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted." [...] In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a [...] "flirty backward glance", causing him to walk into a lamp-post. Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt [...] "the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines".|$|E
