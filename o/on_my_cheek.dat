2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
6000|$|The next instant I {{started back}} from him. My heart stood still. I {{put my hand}} up to my face. What did I feel <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek?</b> (I had not been weeping--I was too happy.) What did I feel <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek?</b> A tear! ...|$|E
6000|$|Lo! ever thus thou growest {{beautiful}} [...] In silence, then before thine answer given [...] Departest, and thy {{tears are}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes opened}} wider and wider in unutterable expectation. She {{suddenly}} advanced her face {{so close to}} mine, that I felt her hot breath <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> as the next words burst their way through her lips.|$|R
6000|$|I {{felt very}} happy too, {{but of course}} I didn't cry: [...] "big things" [...] never do, you know we leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think {{it must have been}} raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She held me with hungry arms. She {{whispered to}} me, [...] "There, there!" [...] as one whispers comfort to a child. [...] . Suddenly she was kissing me. She kissed {{me with a}} hungry {{intensity}} of passion, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips. She kissed me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips with lips that were salt with tears. And I returned her kisses. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "Sad and strange, Sally. That {{was worse}} than my bullet-holes." [...] She gripped my hand. I felt her hair on my brow, felt her breath <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Gardner. [...] "He's {{left his}} mark <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek.</b> Why don't you {{look after the}} fool? You must have come pretty quietly; I didn't hear you until you were half-way up the steps." ...|$|E
6000|$|I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,[mw] [...] There is {{grief in}} the sound, there is guilt in the fame: [...] But the tear which now burns <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> may impart [...] The deep {{thoughts}} that dwell in that silence of heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas," [...] said Madame de Pompadour, [...] "we are all {{reduced to}} that [...] about {{everything}} in the world: I don't know how they compound [...] the rouge that I put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and I should be vastly [...] puzzled {{if they were to}} ask me how they make my silk [...] stockings." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was early}} on a raw, cold, damp morning {{toward the end of}} spring, and the world was before me; {{stretching}} away a long muddy road, lined with comfortable houses, whose inmates were taking their sunrise naps, heedless of the wayfarer passing. The cold drops of drizzle trickled down my leather cap, and mingled with a few hot tears <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{gazed at}} him fixedly, taking my hands from my face, with the tears still wet <b>on</b> <b>my</b> burning <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Thine eyelash <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> doth play-- [...] 'Tis Mary's hand upon my brow! [...] But let me {{check this}} tender lay [...] Which none may hear {{but she and}} thou! [...] Like the still hive at quiet midnight humming. [...] 35 [...] Murmur it to yourselves, ye two beloved women! ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he flung}} out, and hastened, {{as fast as}} age would let him, to the room in the tower, where he {{expected}} to find me not. But there he did find me:--there was I, sitting {{as if nothing had}} happened, with my hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> and full of my old melancholy.|$|E
6000|$|Communion in spirit! Forgive me, [...] But I, who am earthly and weak, Would {{give all}} my incomes from dreamland [...] For {{a touch of}} her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek.</b> That little shoe in the corner, [...] So worn and {{wrinkled}} and brown, With its emptiness confutes you, [...] And argues your wisdom down.|$|E
6000|$|I turned {{round as}} well as I could--for the ruffian had pulled {{me out of my}} chair--and beheld a great marine monster, six feet high, who was {{occupied}} in beating and kicking me, in the most ungentlemanly manner, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>my</b> ribs, and between the tails of my coat. [...] "He is a liar, gentlemen, and a scoundrel! The bootmaker had detected him in swindling, and so his niece refused him. Miss Waters was engaged to him from childhood, and he deserted her for the bootmaker's niece, who was richer."--And then sticking a card between my stock and my coat-collar, in what is called the scruff of my neck, the disgusting brute gave me another blow behind my back, and left the coffee-room with his friends.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the wall and cried. It {{was the first time in}} many years that I had cried. I {{remember}} noting, even in my extremity, the warmth of the tears <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks</b> and the salt taste when they reached my lips. Then I had a chill, and for a time shook as with an ague. Abandoning the openness of the yard as too impossible a feat for one in my condition, still shaking with the chill, crouching close to the protecting wall, my hands touching it, I started to skirt the yard.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was early}} in costume the {{following}} morning. I question if my own mother could have known me, had she {{lived long enough to}} see the whiskers sprout <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and to contemplate my countenance as a man. I went into Dunning's library, drew the little hurdy-gurdy from its hiding-place, slung it, and began to play [...] "St. Patrick's Day in the Morning," [...] with spirit, and, I trust I may add, with execution. I was in the height of the air, when the door opened, and Barney thrust his high-cheeked-bone face into the room, his mouth as wide open as that of a frozen porker.|$|R
6000|$|And in {{the night}} as I lay weak, [...] As I lay weak, The leaves a-falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> [...] The red moon low {{declined}} - The ghost of him I'd die to kiss Rose up and said: [...] "Ah, tell me this! Was the child mine, or was it his? [...] Speak, that I rest may find!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I cud gyard he had {{his gloved}} fist home <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> an' down I went full-sprawl. 'Will that content you?' sez he, blowin' on his {{knuckles}} {{for all the world}} like a Scots Greys orf'cer. 'Content!' sez I.

5000|$|Dog mushing in Alaska can be hazardous. According to Women Warriors (2004) Jonrowe said, [...] "I've {{had back}} surgery, frozen my shoulder, broken my hand…I think I've had every single cold related injury. I haven't had any amputations, but I have had severe {{frostbite}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> fingers, <b>cheeks</b> and nose. I even frostbit my corneas some years ago".|$|R
60|$|Nothing further occurred, {{worthy of}} notice. I passed the {{afternoon}} with Grace, {{in the little}} room; and we conversed much of the past, of our parents in particular, without adverting, however, to her situation, any further than to apprise her of what I had done. I thought she was not sorry to learn I had sent for Lucy, now that I was with her, {{and it was no}} longer possible her illness could be concealed. As for the physicians, when they were mentioned, I could see a look of tender concern in Grace's eyes, as if she regretted that I still clung to the delusion of hoping to see her health restored. Notwithstanding these little drawbacks, we passed a sweet eventide together. For more than an hour, Grace lay <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom, occasionally patting her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> as the child caresses its mother. This was an old habit of hers, and it was one I was equally delighted and pained to have her resume, now we were of the age and stature of man and woman.|$|R
60|$|When Bessie {{brought up}} Gus Sinclair's card Alicia dropped a pecky little kiss <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> and pushed {{me toward the}} door. I went down calmly, {{although}} I'll admit that my heart was beating wildly. Gus Sinclair was plainly nervous, but I was composed enough for both. You would really have thought that I was {{in the habit of}} being proposed to by a millionaire every day.|$|E
60|$|She darted from me {{into the}} passage; the gate closed between us--she {{was left in the}} fangs of this man of crime, a prisoner, still to inhale the pestilential {{atmosphere}} which adhered to his demoniac nature; the unimpeded breeze played <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> the moon shone graciously upon me, my path was free. Glad to have escaped, yet melancholy in my very joy, I retrod my steps to Versailles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] sighed {{the weary}} little Spirit, [...] "shall I {{never see the}} light again, or feel the warm winds <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek?</b> It is a dreary way indeed, and but for the Seasons' gifts I should have perished long ago; but the heavy clouds MUST pass away at last, and all be fair again. So hasten on, good Breeze, and bring me quickly to my journey's end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! I will willingly remain--I will joyfully await you!' {{cried the}} girl, raising her beaming eyes to Hermanric's face. 'I will never speak mournfully to you again; I will never remind you more {{of all that}} I have suffered, and all that I have lost! How merciful you were to me, when I first saw you in your tent--how doubly merciful you are to me here! I am proud when I look on your stature, and your strength, and your heavy weapons, and {{know that you are}} happy in {{remaining}} with me; that you will succour my father; that you will return from your glittering encampments to this farm-house, where I am left to await you! Already I have forgotten all that has happened to me of woe; already I am more joyful than ever I was in my life before! See, I am no longer weeping in sorrow! If there are any tears still <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> they are the tears of gladness that every one welcomes--tears to sing and rejoice in!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fear {{not that}} I {{shall be the}} {{instrument}} of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{she raised}} her veil for a moment, and kissed me, I felt <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own <b>cheek</b> the tears that were falling fast over hers. I {{followed}} her and my father down stairs. When they reached the street, she gave me her hand--it was cold and powerless. I knew that the fortitude she had promised to show, was giving way, {{in spite of all}} her efforts to preserve it; so I let her hurry into the carriage without detaining her by any last words. The next instant she and my father were driven rapidly from the door.|$|R
60|$|This was the first, the last, {{the only}} intimation I {{had ever heard}} from Grace, of her being {{conscious}} of any defect in Rupert's character. Would to God she had seen this important deficiency earlier! though this is wishing a child to possess the discernment and intelligence of a woman. The hand was still <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> and I {{would not have had}} it removed at that bitter moment to have been well assured of Lucy's love.|$|E
6000|$|It was an hour later, and Hilda and I {{were alone}} in the chamber of death. As Sebastian lay there, a marble figure, with his keen eyes closed and his pinched, thin face whiter and serener than ever, I could not help gazing at him with some pangs of recollection. I could not avoid recalling the time when his very name was to me a word of power, and when the thought of him roused <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek</b> a red flush of enthusiasm. As I looked I murmured two lines from Browning's Grammarian's Funeral: ...|$|E
60|$|As I said before, I {{was sitting}} near the stove, let {{into the wall}} beneath the {{refectory}} and the carré, and thus sufficing to heat both apartments. Piercing the same wall, and close beside the stove, was a window, looking also into the carré; as I looked up a cap-tassel, a brow, two eyes, filled a pane of that window; the fixed gaze of those two eyes hit right against my own glance: they were watching me. I had not till that moment known that tears were <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheek,</b> but I felt them now.|$|E
60|$|I {{was kept}} at Paso by an {{inflammatory}} eruption, {{brought on by}} the constant attacks of small acari-like harvest-bugs, for which the forests of Ceram are famous, and also by the want of nourishing food while in that island. At one time I was covered with severe boils. I had them <b>on</b> <b>my</b> eye, <b>cheek,</b> armpits, elbows, back, thighs, knees, and ankles, so that I was unable to sit or walk, and had great difficulty in finding a side to lie upon without pain. These continued for some weeks, fresh ones coming out as fast as others got well; but good living and sea baths ultimately cured them.|$|R
60|$|My {{nautical}} pursuits {{filled up}} all my time, {{and took me}} far away from my country and my friends. But, whatever I did, and wherever I went, the memory of Uncle George, {{and the desire to}} penetrate the mystery of his disappearance, haunted me like familiar spirits. Often, in the lonely watches of the night at sea, did I recall the dark evening on the beach, the strange man's hurried embrace, the startling sensation of feeling his tears <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>cheeks,</b> the disappearance of him before I had breath or self-possession enough to say a word. Often did I think over the inexplicable events that followed, when I had returned, after my sister's funeral, to my father's house; and oftener still did I puzzle my brains vainly, in the attempt to form some plan for inducing my mother or my aunt to disclose the secret which they had hitherto kept from me so perseveringly. My only chance of knowing what had really happened to Uncle George, my only hope of seeing him again, rested with those two near and dear relatives. I despaired of ever getting my mother to speak on the forbidden subject after what had passed between us, but I felt more sanguine about my prospects of ultimately inducing my aunt to relax in her discretion. My anticipations, however, in this direction were not destined to be fulfilled. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> next visit to England I found my aunt prostrated by a paralytic attack, which deprived her of the power of speech. She died soon afterward in my arms, leaving me her sole heir. I searched anxiously among her papers for some reference to the family mystery, but found no clew to guide me. All my mother's letters to her sister at the time of Caroline's illness and death had been destroyed.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} nimble {{stepping}} of the pony's hoofs on the worn turf. A sullen malice smouldered in its reddish, luminous eyes. When I clutched at its bridle it jerked back its sensitive {{head as if}} teased with a gadfly. The gipsy daubed vermilion <b>on</b> <b>my</b> friend's sallow <b>cheeks.</b> She shook out the tarnished finery she had brought with her and hung it round the stooping shoulders. She plastered down his black hair above his eyes, and thrust a riding-whip into his hand.|$|R
