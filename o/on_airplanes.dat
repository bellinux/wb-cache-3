5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play <b>on</b> <b>airplanes.</b> Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Durbin {{introduced}} major tobacco regulation {{legislation in}} the House to ban cigarette smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. He was joined by Rep. C.W.

25|$|The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has {{established}} regulations regarding the carrying of {{certain types of}} batteries <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> because of their instability in certain situations. This action was partially inspired by a cargo bay fire on a FedEx airplane and the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6. On 16 May 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) banned shipping anything containing a lithium battery to an overseas address due to fires from transport of batteries. The ban was lifted on 15 November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Replacing {{the more}} {{familiar}} landing gear found <b>on</b> <b>airplanes,</b> the Aeroscraft is equipped with landing cushions that aid the vehicle's unique functionality. They aid landing on unimproved surfaces, even water, and perform like a hovercraft during taxi by pushing air through them. In addition, the landing cushions are equipped with very powerful gripping/suction capabilities that ensure the vehicle stays grounded and in place when not in flight. This reversible airflow helps hold the vehicle to the ground, even when the Aeroscraft arrives at destination for cargo offloading, allowing it to operate in heavier wind conditions.|$|E

Her total of 956,733 air miles ended up falling short of Condoleezza Rice's record for total mileage. That total, 1,059,207, was bolstered late in Rice's tenure by repeated trips to the Middle East. Clinton traveled during 401 days, with 306 of those spent in actual diplomatic meetings, and spent the equivalent of 87 full days <b>on</b> <b>airplanes.</b> Compared to other recent secretaries, Clinton traveled more broadly, with fewer repeat visits to certain countries.|$|E

25|$|It is {{typically}} constructed from a short piece or tuft of yarn {{placed in the}} free air stream where it is visible to the pilot. In closed cockpit aircraft, it is usually taped to the aircraft canopy. It may also be mounted on the aircraft's nose, either directly on the skin, or elevated on a mast, in which case {{it may also be}} fitted with a small paper cone at the trailing end. They are commonly used on gliders, but may also be found on jet aircraft (especially fighters), ultralight aircraft, light-sport aircraft, autogyros, airplanes and helicopters. Its usefulness <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> with a tractor configuration (single propeller at the nose) is limited because the propeller creates turbulence and the spiral slipstream displaces the string to one side.|$|E
25|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics, {{when the}} Olympic flame {{came to the}} Panathinaiko Stadium to start the global torch relay, the night was very windy and the torch, lit by the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, blew out due to the wind, but was re-lit from the backup flame taken from the {{original}} ceremonial flame at Olympia. In 2008 the Olympic torch was extinguished at least two times by Chinese officials (five times according to French police) {{so that it could}} be transported in a bus amid protests while it was being paraded through Paris. This eventually led to the cancellation of the relay's last leg in the city. The flame itself, however, remained preserved in the back-up lantern used to keep it overnight and <b>on</b> <b>airplanes,</b> and the torch was relit using this.|$|E

500|$|Ghiorso and {{co-workers}} analyzed filter papers {{which had been}} flown through the explosion cloud <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> (the same sampling technique {{that had been used}} to discover [...] ). Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S. The separation of suspected new elements was carried out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH ≈ 3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end. Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its 253Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy alpha decay at 6.6MeV. It was produced by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a half-life of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the mass number without changing the atomic number of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number: ...|$|E
500|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{cautious}} Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out {{ways of dealing with}} each other. In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling <b>on</b> <b>airplanes</b> or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread how bad the economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration. On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter [...] "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..." [...] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk [...] " [...] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit." [...] Former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham said, [...] "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like." [...] Biden gained a long-running alter ego persona, [...] "The President of Vice", on the satirical news site The Onion, which parodied his job title. [...] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.|$|E
