5|$|On October 14, 1990, United Airlines {{became the}} 777's launch {{customer}} when it placed {{an order for}} 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11billion with options on an additional 34. The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s. United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a hot and high airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes. In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher <b>operating</b> <b>weight</b> options.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum {{airspeed}} indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. [...] "The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the approach speed of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the approach speed of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the <b>operating</b> <b>weight</b> of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper approach speed of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left room for error. With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum air speed indicator is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot. The testing of the new indicator is under the supervision of Major Oliver D. Taylor, 3245th Test Group (Bombardment), Air Force Operational Test Center." ...|$|E

50|$|Performance: The MD-83 {{features}} increased {{fuel capacity}} as standard (to 6970 gal), which is carried in two 565 gal auxiliary tanks located {{fore and aft}} of the center section. The aircraft also has higher <b>operating</b> <b>weights,</b> with MTOW increased to 160000 lb and MLW to 139500 lb. Typical range for the MD-83 with 155 passengers is around 2504 nmi km. To cope with the higher <b>operating</b> <b>weights,</b> the MD-83 incorporates strengthened landing gear including new wheels, tires, and brakes, changes to the wing skins, front spar web and elevator spar cap, and strengthened floor beams and panels to carry the auxiliary fuel tanks. From MD-80 line number 1194, an MD-81 delivered in September 1985, it is understood that all MD-80s have the same basic wing structure and in theory could be converted to MD-83 standard.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} which <b>operates</b> <b>weight</b> adaptation {{by means of a}} periodic law and is based on the Widely Linear Quaternion Least Mean Square (WL-QLMS) algorithm. The WL-QLMS successfully handles real-world signals, either proper or improper. However, because of the introduction of full second order statistics into the algorithm, its computational cost is quadruplicated with respect to its precursor QLMS. The proposed Widely Linear Block Quaternion Least Mean Square (WL-BQLMS) algorithm speeds up the execution, thus revealing itself as a good solution in 3 D audio signal processing applications, where huge amounts of data are usually treated and signals are typically improper. Simulations exploiting 3 D Ambisonic B-Format audio signals provide a report of the WL-BQLMS behavior in comparison with BQLMS...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to show the environmental and operating cost savings that could be achieved if long range transport aircraft were designed for shorter ranges; obviously at the drawback of longer trip duration, for the inevitable intermediate stop. The maximum take-off <b>weight</b> and <b>operating</b> empty <b>weight,</b> main design variables of transport airplanes, would be greatly reduced. However, it would be impossible to take full advantage of this procedure for, on the one hand, it would be difficult to find a suitable airport at the exact midpoint and, moreover, there would be a certain increase in the total distance because of the deviation. The overall result will depend on the length of the route, the technology level (range factor and <b>operating</b> empty <b>weight</b> fraction with respect to maximum take-off weight), and other variables that will be discussed. Only for very long routes and/or very high fuel cost the shorter design range case represents a meaningful saving with respect to the non-stop flight...|$|R

40|$|Adult {{learning}} {{takes place}} {{not only in}} educational organisations, but through participation in leisure and special interest groups. Commercially <b>operated</b> <b>weight</b> management organisations recruit large numbers of adults to their classes {{to learn how to}} eat healthily and lose weight. They publish readers' 'real life' success stories in their magazines. This paper demonstrates that analysing these accounts contributes {{to our understanding of the}} kind of learning that results from membership of these organisations. It employs close textual analyses of the stories to generate insights that complement the knowledge about obesity and its management that comes from medical, therapeutic and scientific research. The analyses suggest that adults can experience significant changes in eating behaviours and lifestyle as a result of participation. They also report major changes in self confidence, success and relationships. It notes the dependency on the organisation created by the classes and the absence in the stories of any critique of social attitudes towards weight and body image and tentatively concludes that this may partially explain why such apparently life-changing learning is so often unsustainable...|$|R
