5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and a half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and {{what had been a}} 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the return}} game at Hampden Park, Scotland {{had found the}} {{physical}} presence of Welsh striker Mark Hughes difficult to contain – {{it had been a}} challenge from Hughes on defender Alex McLeish that had allowed Ian Rush to score the winner in that game. So, Stein had set his team up with a line of five defenders at the back; this allowed Richard Gough to remain close to Hughes, with McLeish, Roy Aitken, Maurice Malpas and Willie Miller providing defensive cover. The game began at a furious pace, with both teams prepared to fight hard; after only two minutes, Hughes made a heavy tackle on McLeish that incensed the Scotland players, while <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> later McLeish was booked for a challenge on Rush. However, despite the defensive line employed by Scotland, they were unable to prevent Wales taking the lead after thirteen minutes, when Peter Nicholas made a low cross, despite the attention of both Aitken and Steve Nicol, for Hughes to score past goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Wales almost scored again in the twentieth minute when Joey Jones crossed for Robbie James, whose header went just over the bar. In the 38th minute, a Welsh free kick was blocked twice by Leighton, with the second falling at the feet of Hughes, whose shot went just wide. Then, just before half-time, Leighton misjudged the flight of a cross that caused the ball to drop again to Hughes; the Scottish keeper prevented Wales scoring a second by diving at Hughes' feet.|$|E

25|$|The trip to Indianapolis for a Saturday {{night game}} against the Big East's Butler ended in disappointment. The Cougars did have more corner kicks with 6 to the Bulldogs' 5. but they also had more fouls (18–8) and yellow cards (2–0). Butler had 18 shots to SIUE's 7 and led 6–1 in shots-on-goal. The home team took the lead on a rebounded blocked shot put into the net in the 26th minute. The Cougars managed to then hold off the hosts until <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and a quarter remained, when a shot was snaked {{into the corner of}} the net from 20 yards out.|$|E

Then, Brady completed a 25-yard pass to tight end Daniel Graham. Indianapolis managed to halt the drive at their 25-yard line, but Gostkowski kicked a 43-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 34–31 lead with 3:49 left in the game.

25|$|SIUE hosted Missouri State in a Tuesday night MVC match. The Bears, {{riding a}} three-game win streak, struck early, {{tallying}} on a 3rd minute corner that was {{headed into the}} net. The Cougars got the tying goal in the 34th minute, when MSU was called for a handball in the box, and Ledbetter nailed his third penalty kick of the season. The game then became a typical Valley defensive struggle, as both offenses pushed, but both defenses pushed back harder. Late in regulation time, the Bears turned away a Cougar corner kick, but McHugh sent it back in to Ledbetter, who headed it toward the goal and McLean. who scored his second game-winner with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and a half left on the clock.

25|$|Nearly 21 {{hours into}} the race, Kristensen's No. 1 Audi slowed on course on several laps. After {{eventually}} returning to the garage Audi were forced to perform their second turbocharger replacement of the race as the No. 1 was hampered by the same issue that had stopped the No. 2's lead. This promoted Bernhard in the No. 20 Porsche to the race lead with the No. 2 Audi driven by Lotterer <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and a half behind the leader. Porsche's lead lasted only an hour though as it too slowed on the course suffering from a broken anti-roll bar {{and was forced to}} the garage where it was eventually abandoned. The No. 14 Porsche of Lieb came to the garage half an hour later with gearbox issues after slowing at Mulsanne corner but returned to the race in the final half hour. The shake-up in LMP1 promoted the No. 2 Audi to the race lead, three laps ahead of di Grassi's No. 1 Audi and followed by Davidson's No. 8 Toyota, still recovering from its accident in the opening hours of the race. The attrition amongst LMP1 cars also allowed the No. 12 Rebellion Racing, the sole remaining LMP1-L car in the race, into fourth place overall. The ailing OAK Ligier of Brundle was also forced to abandon the LMP2 lead after being caught by the faster TDS Ligier of Gommendy and Harry Tincknell's Jota Zytek, before eventually having a lengthy stop for more work on the troubled engine which dropped them from contention.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, a new fire {{broke out}} {{on the island of}} Kornat, part of the Kornati National park. A team of 23 firemen was sent on an Mi-8 {{helicopter}} on what they thought would be just a routine mission. Upon arrival, they split into two teams, one with 6 firemen and the other with 17. The latter split up one more time when three firemen lost their communication gear and again when the fourth one went checking for the signal, while trying to call his superiors. The remaining 13 were stranded between two hills with no water whatsoever, since the large water canister landed 500 meters away from them. While searching for it, they got encircled by a wall of fire. Although the burning grass was only 10cm tall, the firemen didn't have the necessary equipment and had nowhere to run. In <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> six of them were killed instantly, while the other seven remained lying on the ground, badly burned, waiting for help more than two hours. After the rescue, they were sent to the hospital in Zadar and then transferred to hospitals in Zagreb and Split. Six of them died in hospital because of serious burns covering large areas of their bodies. The fire itself had nowhere to spread, and was soon naturally extinguished, bringing up many questions about the necessity of the intervention. Allegedly, the firemen were killed by an unexploded CBU-87 dumped over Kornat island by NATO planes returning from the Kosovo war in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Spurs {{followed}} their title win with a second-place {{finish in the}} 1951–52 season, but then went into a sharp decline, finishing 10th in 1952–53 and 16th in 1953–54. The slump was partly because the players who had formed {{the spine of the}} championship-winning side were losing their fitness—push-and-run required players of exceptional physical condition, and Ramsey, Nicholson, Burgess and others were all past 30. Ramsey was furthermore affected by a recurring abdominal injury. His preference for ball play rather than simply clearing it became unpopular among sections of Tottenham's support. A particularly low ebb came in the 1952–53 FA Cup semi-final, against Blackpool at Villa Park on 21 March 1953. Ramsey had played well, keeping the Blackpool left-winger Bill Perry quiet, and with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to spare the game was finely balanced at 1–1. Ramsey then made a fatal error. Having easily beaten Perry to a cross-field pass from a free-kick, he set himself to slide the ball back to the goalkeeper Ditchburn in a situation when most defenders would have cleared it. The ball bounced off Ramsey's knee and ran away from him, allowing Blackpool forward Jackie Mudie to score. Blackpool won 2–1, and went on to win what is commonly referred to as the [...] "Matthews Final".|$|E
500|$|Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has {{received}} mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing. VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may {{know little about}} them due to their role in Kingdom Hearts II, but with Birth by Sleep, players will able to know about them. Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he [...] "can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be [...] "uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source." [...] Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film [...] due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game [...] "won't turn out to be very pretty." [...] Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra [...] "tortured and conflicted", but still criticizing the result.
