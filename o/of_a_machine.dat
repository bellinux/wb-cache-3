5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have {{a higher rate of}} fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a machine gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected trade union {{official}} in his firm, participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike against the war. His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the steady state stable region <b>of</b> <b>an</b> AC Excited Synchronous Machine (AESM), especially <b>of</b> that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> induction <b>machine</b> type, is presented in this paper. The AESM essentially has two unstable phenomena, one is the stepout, the other the hunting. The step-out can {{be judged by the}} steady state stability condition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> synchronous <b>machine</b> type; on the other hand the hunting can be judged by that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> induction <b>machine</b> type. The steady state stable region <b>of</b> <b>a</b> synchronous <b>machine</b> type always exists at any slip within the range of 180 degrees of the extended internal displacement angle. However the stable region <b>of</b> <b>an</b> induction <b>machine</b> type is not as simple; that is, it changes complexly for ships and ceases to exist beyond the range of certain slips (boundary slips). This paper derives these boundary slips and shows by numerical calculations that it is very effective to increase the secondary resistance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> AESM for the expansion of the steady state stable region <b>of</b> <b>an</b> induction <b>machine</b> type...|$|R
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Robert Cook wrote Gumball for {{publication}} by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund {{had a reputation}} as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the gumball conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned to add more background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs move through the pipes.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe problem <b>of</b> {{configuring}} <b>a</b> <b>machining</b> {{operation is}} complex (many parameters and many interactions between parameters) and is generally achieved thanks to expert heuristic knowledge. Indeed, the configuration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machining</b> operation is often carried out {{according to a}} specific procedure: choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> operation and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>machine,</b> then choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> tools {{and at the end}} selection of cutting conditions. We propose in this paper a general framework for the configuration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machining</b> operation based on a constraint representation and manipulation. We first present <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> the decision variables (such as the machine, the tool, the insert or the feed rate), the non-decision variable and the constraints between variables. An overview of the 32 identified constraints is given in the paper. Even though it is not exhaustive, the basic constraints of the domain are represented. <b>A</b> typology <b>of</b> the constraints to be manipulated is then given leading order to <b>a</b> specification <b>of</b> algorithms for search and consistency checking that may allow to manage these kinds of constraints...|$|R

5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
