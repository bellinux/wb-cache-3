5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about four inches across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Ohioan docked at New York on 22 May on {{her next}} voyage with {{a portion of}} the 328th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 82nd Infantry Division. One {{of the members of the}} unit was Sergeant Alvin C. York, who had led an attack on a German machine gun nest during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and {{captured}} 132German officers and men. York had been honored with the U.S. Medal of Honor and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm (among other awards), both of which he wore <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> on arrival at New York. After Ohioan docked, York held a well-attended press conference on board.|$|E

25|$|It {{may appear}} in a {{building}} for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms.

25|$|Although Pope Benedict XVI's second pallium was not {{actually}} made until 2008, {{the model for}} it already existed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. A scarcely known fact is that a precedent for Pope Benedict XVI's variations of the pallium was set in 1999 when Pope John Paul II wore a long Y-shaped pallium with red crosses for that year's Easter celebrations. It was only used that one time and was created by Piero Marini, the then Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, who would also create Pope Benedict's first pallium.|$|E

25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.|$|E
25|$|When Caine {{was nine}} he lost {{two of his}} young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah {{developed}} hydrocephaly after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in convulsions brought on by whooping cough she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was {{to be sent to}} the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label pinned <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He would later draw on this experience when writing the scene in The Bondman in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care. Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan {{revealed}} that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged {{in his left}} shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which {{would probably have been}} fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.|$|E
500|$|As the fleets converged, Victory’s captain, Thomas Hardy, {{suggested}} that Nelson remove the decorations <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> {{so that he}} would not be so easily identified by enemy sharpshooters. Nelson replied that it was too late [...] "to be shifting a coat", adding that they were [...] "military orders and he did not fear to show them to the enemy". Captain Henry Blackwood, of the frigate , suggested Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe the battle. Nelson refused, and also turned down Hardy's suggestion to let Eliab Harvey's [...] come ahead of Victory and lead the line into battle.|$|E

2500|$|It was Father Trevis who {{suggested}} the parish's name change. He had visited Paray-le-Monial in France where St. Margaret Mary Alacoque had the {{visions of the}} Sacred Heart. [...] The devotion was also popular within St. Margaret's parish. [...] Bishop Cosgrove also had a devotion to the Sacred Heart and had the image emblazoned <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. [...] The bishop requested permission from Pope Leo XIII to name the new church Sacred Heart Cathedral. [...] On December 23, 1889, the pope granted this permission {{on the grounds that}} a chapel dedicated to St. Margaret be maintained in the church. [...] Sacred Heart Cathedral was the first cathedral to be dedicated to the Sacred Heart in the United States.|$|E
