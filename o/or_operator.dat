500|$|The imitating {{species is}} called the mimic, while the imitated species (protected by its toxicity, foul taste or other defenses) {{is known as the}} model. The predatory species {{mediating}} indirect interactions between the mimic and the model is variously known as the [...] receiver, dupe <b>or</b> <b>operator.</b> By parasitizing the honest warning signal of the model, the Batesian mimic gains an advantage, without having to go to the expense of arming itself. The model, on the other hand, is disadvantaged, along with the dupe. If impostors appear in high numbers, positive experiences with the mimic may result in the model being treated as harmless. At higher frequency there is also a stronger selective advantage for the predator to distinguish mimic from model. For this reason, mimics are usually less numerous than models, an instance of frequency dependent selection. Some mimetic populations have evolved multiple forms (polymorphism), enabling them to mimic several different models and thereby to gain greater protection. Batesian mimicry is not always perfect. A variety of explanations have been proposed for this, including limitations in predators' cognition.|$|E
