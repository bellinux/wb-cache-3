5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra <b>over</b> <b>a</b> number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits <b>over</b> <b>a</b> cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras <b>over</b> <b>a</b> given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra <b>over</b> <b>a</b> field.|$|E

In this paper, a generalized scheme is proposed, where the channel variation <b>over</b> <b>an</b> OFDM symbol is approximated by a general polynomial model.
