Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material {{could be used to}} improve the quality of life for human citizens.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{sectors in}} Eastern and Central Europe are large, and a {{substantial}} number of people are directly affected by changes in producer prices, farm employment, and land ownership. Retail food markets are among the most distorted in the pre-transition economies, and the needed adjustments are correspondingly large. The decollectivization of agriculture and return of land to former owners are among the most dramatic and emotive elements of the economic transition. The agricultural transition requires substantial adjustments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> demand and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> food economy. Decollectivization and distribution of property rights in land is an important component of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> adjustment, and merits careful attention. The essence of the agricultural transition, however, is the withdrawal of the state from its traditional role as residual claimant of (positive and negative) rents to the use of agricultural resources. That role will pass in stages to owners of land, where it ordinarily resides in a market economy. In this paper we place the agricultural transition in its larger context, and treat the distribution of land more briefly. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side,</b> since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel {{a year are}} required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E
25|$|People {{frequently}} do not trade {{directly on}} markets. Instead, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side,</b> they may work in and produce through firms.

According to Ronald Coase, {{people begin to}} organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market. Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater economies of scale (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.|$|E

25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} systematized {{supply and}} demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output {{and the distribution of}} income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value inherited from classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side.</b> In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility, which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> of the market, some {{factors of}} {{production}} are described as (relatively) variable in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed, such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{publicly}} funded health care programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor, and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay; however, a system of universal health care has not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population. Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side.</b> In most OECD countries, there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance. The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs. The U.S., as a matter of oft-stated public policy, largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers, assuming the private sector to do it better.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed {{in a way that}} ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
2500|$|The body {{of theory}} later termed [...] "neoclassical economics" [...] or [...] "marginalism" [...] formed from about 1870 to 1910.

This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income.

2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side.</b> For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on commodity futures price volatility emphasizes time to expiration and {{the resolution of}} uncertainty. In this paper we stress <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> and demand inflexibilities arising from decision making. A decision made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> (demand) <b>side</b> makes future <b>supply</b> (demand) responses less elastic. Therefore, a shock arising after a decision is made is more effective in changing the futures price than a shock before the decision is made. The results support the time-to-maturity hypothesis, but do not conflict with the state variable hypotheses of futures price volatility. Evidence supporting the impacts of inflexibilities are presented for corn, soybean, and wheat contracts. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

2500|$|Much of the {{violence}} between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel {{is the result of}} fighting over cocaine supplies from South America. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>side,</b> the increased pressures on Sinaloa kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, whose operations in Colombia in 2012 prompted his organization to grab larger shares of cocaine from Peru and Ecuador, threatened the supply-lines of Los Zetas, and triggered tit-for-tat attacks among both cartels. The Sinaloa cartel and Los Zetas are [...] "regional and cultural opposites," [...] because the Sinaloa organization has been moving drugs north from the ranch country parts in Mexico into the U.S. for generations, while Los Zetas are newer arrivals from the more urban eastern coast. In addition, Los Zetas is a transient cartel without real territory or a secure stream of income, while the Sinaloa Cartel has a lucrative cocaine trade and the control of smuggling routes and territories. But the former are heavily armed, while the latter's enforcement arm is weaker. The Sinaloa cartel uses tit-for-tat attacks as a way of bringing down the newcomers; for Los Zetas, it is about maintaining their violent reputation – the organization's most valued asset. Moreover, Los Zetas pose a bigger insurgency threat to the Mexican government than the older cartels in the country because of the brutality of their attacks against the security forces, their disregard for civilians' lives, and their dangerous habits that go beyond the [...] "unspoken codes of older traffickers." [...] The violent reputation of Los Zetas has made northeastern Mexico a no-go zone for many. Los Zetas, unlike the other traditional drug cartels, act like urban guerrillas; a police chief in Mexico explained how the Zetas would make anonymous phone calls to get the police out in the streets, block the road where the police were, and then open fire from all sides. In addition, the goal of Los Zetas differs greatly from other drug trafficking organizations in Mexico. Other cartels focus primarily in drug producing and drug trafficking, while Los Zetas often move into urban areas to diversify their criminal agenda and carry out a number of crimes. Their presence represents a new model for organize crime, unseating many older cartels with their brutal violent tactics that destabilize Mexico.|$|E
