5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing,</b> mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> network had the greatest call on London Underground funds.

Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E

The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
5|$|From Hackettstown to Denville, Routes 5 ran {{concurrently}} with Pre-1927 Route 12, {{which was}} first legislated in 1917. A mostly-new road (now eastbound US 46) was built from Hackettstown east to Netcong to avoid steep grades <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> roads. Portions {{of the existing}} Budd's Lake Road were used between Budd Lake and Netcong. From Netcong the route used the old Morris Turnpike to Ledgewood and the Dover Turnpike to Dover, running into Dover on Blackwell Street. Blackwell Street led to Rockaway Road, becoming Main Street in Rockaway, from which it used the old Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Denville.|$|E

5|$|On July 15, 1961, to {{meet the}} burgeoning {{educational}} demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing {{the establishment of a}} new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860acres (23.7km²) of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse {{in the early days of}} World War II.|$|E

5|$|The High Street retains various {{independent}} shops, {{including a}} cobbler and a butcher, but {{is seen as}} in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> shopping area rather than encouraging new developments outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within {{the vicinity of the}} High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of I-69 in the 1980s, and {{the approval of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement, increased traffic at the Blue Water Bridge. A new toll and customs plaza was built in 1991, and later the next year, an international task force determined that traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> structure was exceeding capacity. Environmental planning started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened. The original span was closed for rehabilitation, and both were opened to traffic in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} in the secluded south-west corner of the Palace of Westminster, overlooking the King's garden in the Privy Palace, the most private part of Westminster. The tower was positioned {{so as not to}} encroach <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> palace, but this meant it was built on top of land owned by the neighbouring Westminster Abbey. It took six years for the Abbey to convince the King to agree to compensate for them for this annexation. William Usshborne, one of Edward's officials, was blamed for this and, when he later choked to death while eating a fish from a pond in the palace, the monks argued that this was divine justice {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E

5|$|US730 {{was created}} with the {{original}} United States Highways on November 11, 1926, traveling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> Columbia River Highway, established in 1917, from US30 in Umatilla to US410 south of Wallula. The Washington section of US730 {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road3, later becoming a branch of Primary State Highway3 (PSH3) in 1937. The highway was concurrent with US395 from 1937 until 1985, traveling from Cold Springs Junction to US410. US30 was moved to a new route bypassing Umatilla and Irrigon in 1946, allowing for US730 to be extended southwest to Boardman, later to an interchange with I-84.|$|E
5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit and Washington State Ferries.|$|E
