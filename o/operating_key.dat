50|$|A {{control key}} {{is a special}} key used in {{removable}} core locking systems. The control key enables a user, who has very little skill, to remove from the core, with a specific combination, {{and replace it with}} a core that has a different combination. In Small Format Interchangeable Cores locks(SFIC), similar to those developed by Frank Best of the Best Lock Corporation, the key operates a separate shear line that is located above the <b>operating</b> <b>key</b> shear line. In Large Format Removable Cores (LFRC), the key may operate a separate shear line or the key may work like a master key along the operating shear line and also contact a separate locking pin that holds the core in the cylinder. SFIC's are transferable from one brand's housing to another, while LFRC's are not.|$|E

Maison key systems are often found in apartment building common areas, such as main entrance or a laundry room where individual residents can use their own apartment key to access these areas. Unlike a master key system, where each individual lock has one individual <b>operating</b> <b>key</b> and one common master key, Maison lock is designed to be operated by every key within the system.|$|E

To set against the risks to data quality of any loss of expertise, especially among London-based staff who were unwilling to move, including analysts in National Accounts and in health statistics, Ms. Dunnell defended ONS implementation of government policy on civil service relocation. In the face of some Bank of England disquiet, reported in 2007 to the Treasury Select Committee, about risks to economic data quality, combined with opposition from London staff (including a {{lack of confidence in}} management expressed in a staff survey highlighted by staff unions), she asserted that the ONS Board had agreed a process of managed and gradual change to take account of these risks, building up expertise in Newport before shifting functions there. She also cited the benefits to the local economy, the skills of existing ONS staff in Newport and access to universities and other resources in the region as well as the benefits of <b>operating</b> <b>key</b> functions from a single location.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the present work is to compare {{the performance of the}} regenerator of pulse tube refrigerators at low and high frequencies. The hydrodynamic and thermal behavior of the regenerator is investigated in this respect. To consider the system performance, a system of conservation equations including two energy equations for the regenerator as a porous media is employed. The present model considers one-dimensional, periodic, unsteady, compressible flow in the regenerator. The conservation equations are transformed by implementing the volumetric average scheme. The method of harmonic approximation is employed to derive an analytical solution. To explore the system performance, net energy flow and entropy generation minimization techniques are applied, in order to calculate the regenerator first and second law efficiencies.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{concepts}} of structural models of markets, market integration, and market discontinuity to show that discontinuous markets alter the integration characteristics of continuous markets. When analyzing systems of contiguous markets, {{some of which are}} discontinuous, it appears that the continuous markets are less well integrated when the discontinuous markets are operating than when they are not <b>operating.</b> <b>Key</b> words: alfalfa hay, continuous markets, discontinuous markets, integration tests, spatial market integration. The role of discontinuous markets (those in which transactions do not occur during some time pe-riods) has been neglected in the debate over how to define a "market. " Many economic sectors include discontinuous markets. For example, markets for many agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, are seasonal, or more generally discontinuous in that transac-tions occur during part of the annual marketing cycle and are absent during the remainder of the cycle. Because of differences in production practices (such as irrigating in one area but not another) or climatic factors (caused by differ-ences in elevation), discontinuous and continu-ous markets for the same commodity may op-erate in close spatial proximity. When both continuous and discontinuous markets operate near one another, information from and spatial arbitrage with the discontin-uous market may affect the continuous market and vice versa. However, when the discontin-uous markets are not operating, price informa-tion from and spatial arbitrage opportunities with the discontinuous markets cannot affect the con-tinuous market, because this information and these opportunities are not available. In short, when a discontinuous market is part of a spatial system, the degree of integration of the contin-Roger A. Dahlgran {{is an associate professor of}} agricultural eco-nomics.

40|$|Abstract=The {{following}} {{experiment was}} performed to investigate changes of immune status in the uterus draining lymph nodes of pregnant ICR mice. The experimental animals were divided by duration of pregnancy as follows; Group I, virgin control; Group 11, pregnancy 2 nd day; Group 111, pregnancy 5 th day; Group IV, pregnancy 8 th day; Group V, pregnancy 14 th day; Group VI, pregnancy 19 th day. The objective {{of this study was}} to focus on the changes in both B and T-cell systems. To note changes in the B-cell system, the nunber and distribution pattern of activated B cells were obser-ved, the number of IgM and IgG positive plasma cells was counted,, and the distribution pattern of surface IgM and IgG positive cells was observed. For changes in the T cell system, the distribution pattern of L 3 T 4 positive and Lyt- 2 positive cells was observed. Histochemical staining for activated B cells by means of membrane alkaline phospha-tase activity (mAP) and immunohistochemical staining, such as avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) and alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) techniques for T cell and other B-cell systems were carried out. L 3 T 4 positive cells in the deep cortex and IgM- and IgG-positive plasma cells in the medulla were significantly increa-sed near the term. Lyt- 2 positive cells were increased in the medullary cord or corticome-dullary junction on the 5 th day of pregnancy. The results obtained from the above experiment suggest that the conceptus evokes the immune responses locally as well as systemically and that immune responses against the conceptus involve changes in both the B cell and T cell systems, and especially the the T-cell system in early pregnancy and the B-cell system in late pregnancy may be <b>operating.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining Pregnant mice, Uterus draining lymph nodes, Activated B cells, IgM- and IgG positive cells, WT 4 - and Lyt- 2 positive cel...|$|E
40|$|A {{major focus}} of this book is the {{development}} of failure resolution methods, including bankruptcy and administrative forms of insolvency management, that reduce to a manageable level the damage to the economy caused by any financial firm’s failure. The alternative is the moral hazard of allowing a financial firm to believe that its failure would be dangerous to the financial system and that it would therefore likely receive significant government assistance when its solvency is suddenly threatened. While orderly failure resolution is a desirable principle, I do not believe that it currently applies to all financial firms. In this chapter, I argue that failure resolution could not yet be safely applied to certain firms that <b>operate</b> <b>key</b> financial market infrastructures (FMIs) used for clearing over-the-counter derivatives or tri-party repurchase agreements (repos). The failure of key FMIs could indeed be dangerous to the financial system, even with the best available approaches to failure resolution.

40|$|The current {{pollutant}} {{regulations and}} policies {{have set the}} {{need to consider the}} use of alternative fuels capable of complying with the emission limits still retaining appreciable engine performance. Natural gas has been considered as an effective alternative to gasoline but the drawbacks connected to its use forced the researchers to investigate into fuel additives, dual fuel solutions and innovative engine control strategies. The present work analyzes the use of hydrogen as an additive to CNG for a natural gas production engine of a C-segment vehicle and carries out a thorough investigation into the engine response over a selection of <b>operating</b> <b>key</b> points. The actual focus is set on the investigation into the vehicle as well as into the engine response and performance over driving cycles. Still, the simulation of real driving conditions would set the need to properly quantify for the effect of the hydrogen enriched blends on the full engine map over varying powers and speeds within the vehicle driving cycle. Such an approach often turns out to be too demanding in terms of time and costs and an alternative solution has been hereafter proposed by properly selecting a reduced number of operating points {{on the basis of the}} correspondent residence time and frequency over the NEDC. The selection has been performed by matching the actual engine map to the readings from the NEDC vehicle testing. Different selections have been considered and compared so as to assess for the one embedding the minimum number of working points. The key points are not meant to substitute the accomplishment of the NEDC cycle but are to be used as driving factors in the engine design so as to allow for detecting the optimal hardware and ECU configurations. The so considered engine key points have hence been extensively studied by reproducing the engine performance at the test bench and by performing a detailed heat release analysis. Different composition of the hydrogen-methane blends have been considered up to a 25 % by volume of hydrogen in the mixture and specific attention has been paid to the main combustion parameters and to their optimization. As a matter of fact, such a study would allow for detecting major trends in the engine design and control strategies to compensate for the poor behavior of some of the considered points. As an example, low load and speed operations assessed for the need of a better control of the engine parameters to diminish the cylinder-to-cylinder as well as the cycle-to-cycle variabilit...|$|E
