They have been serialized for the manga anthology book Weekly Shōnen Jump from Shueisha since December 8, 2003. Shueisha is also publishing the first chapters <b>of</b> <b>Gin</b> Tama online on their Weekly Shōnen Jump official website. Viz Media licensed Gin Tama for publication in North America. A 55-page preview from the series was first featured in the January 2006 Shonen Jump issue.

5|$|In 2002, Takahashi began {{publishing}} , a prequel to Ginga Legend Weed and Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin. It {{was originally}} serialized in the Weed World(ウィードWORLD), published by Nihon Bungeisha, between March31,2002 and December10,2002. In March 2003, Nihon Bungeisha released the collected chapters {{in a single}} book and in December2005, it {{was included in the}} omnibus Ginga Densetsu Weed Tokubetsu Han with Weed Gaiden. Since then has been reprinted twice: 2007 and 2015. The one-shot follows Riki, father <b>of</b> <b>Gin</b> and former leader of the Ōu soldiers. Riki, though sired by the prized bear hound Shiro, is born a runt and never homed. After his mother Yamabuki is returned to her owner, Riki, stricken with sadness, decides to visit her.|$|E
5|$|Ginga Legend Weed {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Yoshihiro Takahashi. It is a sequel to his 1980s series , and follows the son <b>of</b> <b>Gin,</b> the title character from the original series. It began serialization in Weekly Manga Goraku magazine in 1999. The Japanese publisher Nihon Bungeisha released the series in collected volumes from January 2000 to September 2009. Cumulatively, 60volumes were published. In October2006, Nihon Bungeisha released the first volume of a reprinted edition of Ginga Legend Weed. The company has released 22volumes of the reprint edition, with the latest published in December2007. The American company ComicsOne licensed the series for release in the United States and Canada in 2000 with the first three volumes released between March and June2001. Additionally, they provided an Adobe Digital Editions e-book version. ComicsOne later went bankrupt. American publisher DrMaster acquired the rights to some of ComicsOne's titles, but not Ginga Legend Weed. While the physical copies are out-of-print, the e-book version is still available.|$|E

50|$|Cotton fiber {{production}} by Cotontchad, which directly reflected production of raw cotton, fell sharply in 1985. This decline was stabilized in 1986-87 by emergency support from international donors. These donors prescribed retrenchment programs {{to prevent the}} total collapse of the cotton industry. The restrictions imposed on the production <b>of</b> <b>ginned</b> cotton fiber, however, reduced by half the number <b>of</b> <b>ginning</b> mills, with raw cotton production limited to about 100,000 tons. Production of edible oils by Cotontchad was also affected by the program of cost savings.|$|R

40|$|The number <b>of</b> cotton <b>gins</b> in the U. S. is {{decreasing}} {{while the number}} of bales produced remains constant or is increasing slightly. Texas produces and processes approximately five million bales each year with approximately 280 cotton gins, while losing approximately 20 cotton gins per year. An analysis of the number <b>of</b> <b>gins</b> in the state suggests that the reduction is constant and linear with an R 2 = 0. 98; indicating that by the year 2018, no gins will remain in business. It is likely that more cotton will be processed by existing gins, with associated longer gin seasons, longer transport distances, and larger module storage areas with associated insurance coverage problems. This paper details a systems engineering project to formulate a simulation model to evaluate the engineering and economic impacts of proposed changes in the traditional processes of harvesting, storing in modules, transporting modules to the <b>gin,</b> and <b>ginning</b> <b>of</b> seed cotton. The results of this work indicate that the minimum cost <b>of</b> <b>ginning</b> occurs at around 150 % utilization...|$|R
40|$|Pima cotton is roller ginned to {{minimize}} dam-age to the fiber. The U. S. roller ginning industry {{has changed over}} the years. Since 1989, the major-ity <b>of</b> <b>gins</b> have shifted from Arizona to California. The number <b>of</b> <b>gins</b> in the United States has also fallen by nearly 50 %, but those operating today have more gin stands and process cotton at nearly twice the rate. This survey was conducted in 2004 - 2005 to better understand how current roller ginning machinery affects Pima cotton quality. There were few similarities in machinery set-ups for seed-cotton cleaning among gins. Most gins use one or two cylinder cleaners and an air-type lint cleaner for lint cleaning.

25|$|While the {{negative}} effects of that phenomenon may have been exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale <b>of</b> <b>gin</b> in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically. However, the peak in consumption was reached seven years later, when the nation of six and one-half million people drank over 18 million gallons <b>of</b> <b>gin.</b> And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities; people in the countryside largely consumed beer, ale and cider.|$|E

25|$|After its peak, gin {{consumption}} rapidly declined. From eighteen {{million gallons}} in 1743, it dropped {{to just over}} seven million gallons in 1751 and to less than two million by 1758, and generally declined {{to the end of}} the century. A number of factors appear to have converged to discourage consumption <b>of</b> <b>gin.</b> These include the production of higher quality beer of lower price, rising corn prices and taxes which eroded the price advantage <b>of</b> <b>gin,</b> a temporary ban on distilling, an increasing criticism of drunkenness, a newer standard of behavior that criticized coarseness and excess, increased tea and coffee consumption, an increase in piety and increasing industrialization with a consequent emphasis on sobriety and labor efficiency.|$|E

The rear third <b>of</b> the <b>gin</b> house rests on short, granite rubble piers, and housed the ground-floor pressing and packaging rooms.

25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style <b>of</b> <b>gin,</b> and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type <b>of</b> <b>gin</b> is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
25|$|The sign-painter is {{the most}} {{difficult}} figure of the two images to characterise. He appeared in preliminary sketches as another jolly fat archetype of Beer Street—but {{by the time of the}} first print, Hogarth had transformed him into a threadbare, scrawny, and somewhat dreamy character who has more in common with the inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>Gin</b> Lane than those who populate the scene below him.|$|E
25|$|Paulson {{sees the}} images as working on {{different}} levels for different classes. The middle classes {{would have seen}} the pictures as a straight comparison of good and evil, while the working classes {{would have seen the}} connection between the prosperity of Beer Street and the poverty <b>of</b> <b>Gin</b> Lane. He focuses on the well-fed woman wedged into the sedan chair at the rear of Beer Street as a cause of the ruin of the gin-addled woman who is the principal focus <b>of</b> <b>Gin</b> Lane. The free-market economy espoused in the King's address and practised in Beer Street leaves the exponents prosperous and corpulent {{but at the same time}} makes the poor poorer. For Paulson the two prints depict the results of a move away from a paternalistic state towards an unregulated market economy. Further, more direct, contrasts are made with the woman in the sedan chair and those in Gin Lane: the woman fed gin as she is wheeled home in a barrow and the dead woman being lifted into her coffin are both mirror images of the hoop-skirted woman reduced to madness and death.|$|E
