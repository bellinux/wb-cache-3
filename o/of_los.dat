40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to utilize web-based training (WBT) to enhance students’ knowledge <b>of</b> learning organization (<b>LO)</b> in a context of electrical technology education in Thailand. The sample chosen for this study included 19 fourth year undergraduate students. The WBT was based on the five disciplines according to Senge (1991) as well as the seven habits of highly effective people (Covey, 1989). The tools for pre-and post- testing were LO model evaluation and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>LO.</b> The reliability <b>of</b> the instruments was 0. 9274 and 0. 9905 respectively. The data were analyzed by using mean (M) and standard deviation (SD), t-test and Pearson product-moment correlation. When pre- and post- tests mean scores <b>of</b> the <b>LO</b> model evaluation and the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> were compared, the mean scores of post-test training were greater than the mean scores of pre-test training. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between pre- and post- tests <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> model evaluation and the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>LO.</b> Thus, it can be concluded that the model of WBT can enhance students’ knowledge <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in this context. Key words: web-based training; learning organization; electrical undergraduate student...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} {{the role of}} the rodent lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LO) in controlling performance in Pavlovian cue-outcome learning and placed the function <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in the broader context of the entire orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) region. We found that functional inactivation <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> disrupted the retention of between- but not within-session extinction behaviour. This finding was not due to the disruption of post-session memory consolidation processes by the functional inactivation <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> or impaired acquisition of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition learning. These data confirmed that LO is necessary for the acquisition of Pavlovian extinction learning. In a second set of experiments we investigated the role <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in guiding behaviour using the sensory specific properties of expected outcomes. Pre-training LO lesions were found to disrupt Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion but not specific satiety or instrumental devaluation by conditioned taste aversion, or the specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer effect. These findings rule out an explanation <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> function in simply representing the sensory specific properties of expected outcomes. The third set of experiments {{examined the}} role <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in the acquisition of simple Pavlovian learning. Pre-training LO lesions increased conditioned responding whereas post-training lesions and functional inactivation <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> decreased conditioned responding. A blocking procedure revealed that decreased responding following LO inactivation did not affect the subsequent blocking of new learning at test. Furthermore, LO inactivation impaired the use of current relative value of outcomes to modulate behaviour. This suggested a role for LO in the expression of conditioned responding but not initial Pavlovian learning. A final set of experiments examined the role <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in a novel Pavlovian differential outcomes expectancy task. Pre-training LO lesions were found to decrease whereas post-training lesions were found to increase response accurate responding. This pattern of results, in combination with the opposite effect of pre- and post-training lesions in simple Pavlovian conditioning demonstrated the importance <b>of</b> <b>LO</b> in guiding Pavlovian behaviour. Taken together, these data demonstrated a role for LO in the integration of sensory and motivational properties of expected outcomes to flexibly control Pavlovian behaviour...|$|R

50|$|As in the Llibre de les dones and {{his other}} books, there are in this book many parts and matters that could {{correspond}} to unwritten volumes <b>of</b> <b>Lo</b> Crestià. The whole book could correspond to the Novè (ninth volume) of his encyclopedic project Lo Crestià, which should deal with Incarnation. Nonetheless, the content of this book is much wider and so, its third treatise deals with incarnation itself. The first treatise deals with predestination, and the Quart (fourth volume) <b>of</b> <b>Lo</b> Crestià should have dealt with this matter. This same book <b>of</b> <b>Lo</b> Crestià had the intention of explaining the seven beatitudes, and the seventh treatise deals with them. This book also explains in detail two sacraments, such as baptism, regarding Christ's baptism by saint John the Baptist and eucharist, about the last supper. And the Desè (tenth volume) <b>of</b> <b>Lo</b> Crestià should have dealt with sacraments. In short, The tenth treatise of this book comes back again to apocalyptic and eschatological matters, and the Tretzè (thisteenth volume) <b>of</b> <b>lo</b> Crestià should have dealt with these matters.|$|R

The techniques were designed based on the metadata standard LOM aiming to promoting more interoperability and reusability <b>of</b> the <b>LO.</b> Some results <b>of</b> preliminary tests have shown a considerable amount of retrieved metadata with a minimal user intervention. ...|$|R
