5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. On the basis <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research,</b> he published a range of academic articles and {{books on the subject}} of barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject. In 1933, he carried out his only archaeological excavation, at the Devil's Humps in Sussex.|$|E

5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E

Insects were {{the focus of the}} scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology. Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happy working with them.|$|E

Then, a shelf falls, trapping them inside, and the girls are burned alive.

5|$|Gerald D. Fischbach (born November 15, 1938) is an American neuroscientist. He {{received}} his M.D. from the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University in 1965 before beginning his research {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health in 1966, where his research focused on the mechanisms of neuromuscular junctions. After his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach was a professor at Harvard University Medical School from 1972–1981 and 1990–1998 and the Washington University School of Medicine from 1981–1990. In 1998, he was named {{the director of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke before becoming the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Columbia University from 2001–2006. Gerald Fischbach currently serves as the scientific director overseeing the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. Throughout Fischbach's career, much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> has focused on the formation and function of the neuromuscular junction, which stemmed from his innovative use of cell culture to study synaptic mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Hewett {{suspended}} {{his research}} during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, {{financed by the}} National Geographic Society, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by the National Geographic Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Thomas Huxley {{published}} On {{the animals}} which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making {{a strong case}} for the bird-dinosaur ancestral link. Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs – based primarily on his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus – remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds. Heilmann more than anyone else was responsible for a widespread rejection of the dinosaur-bird link. His conclusions involved more than the mere rejection of a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs. Several aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> have continued to be influential long after its publication.|$|E

5|$|In the USSR Pontecorvo {{was welcomed}} with honours and given a number of {{privileges}} reserved only to the Soviet nomenklatura. He worked {{until his death in}} what is now the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, concentrating entirely on theoretical studies of high energy particles and continuing his research on neutrinos and decay of muons. In recognition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1953, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1955 and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, and two Orders of Lenin. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 for his work on the weak interaction. He began a lifelong affair with Rodam Amiredzhibi, the wife of poet Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov, in 1950. In 1955 he appeared in public at a press conference where he explained to the world the motivations of his choice to leave the West and work in the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Kingdom revoked his British citizenship on 24 May 1955. Pontecorvo was not permitted to leave the Soviet Union for many years; his first trip abroad being in 1978 when he travelled to Italy for celebrations of Amaldi's 70th birthday. Thereafter, he made frequent trips to Italy, and occasional visits to other countries. France refused to allow him to visit in 1982 and 1984, but relented in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
5|$|Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1925), {{and later}} {{worked as a}} curator at the University Museum of Bergen where his {{research}} on {{the central nervous system}} of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; in the course <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>research</b> he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Carl of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.|$|E
