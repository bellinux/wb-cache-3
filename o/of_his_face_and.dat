5|$|Croneman {{claims to}} be the mightiest barbarian of the {{northern}} tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The Black Currant in Thrud the Destroyer, he is depicted with a line of sutures running down the middle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> chest.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an image that looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing the skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E

25|$|Referred {{pain can}} be {{indicative}} of nerve damage. A case study done on a 63-year-old man with a sustained injury during his childhood developed referred pain symptoms after his face or back was touched. After even a light touch, there was shooting pain in his arm. The study concluded {{that the reason for}} this man's pain was possibly due to a neural reorganization which sensitized regions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> back after the nerve damage occurred. It is mentioned that this case is very similar to what phantom limb syndrome patients suffer. This conclusion was based on experimental evidence gathered by V. Ramachandran in 1993, with the difference being that the arm that is in pain is still attached to the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{schooner}} Prince of Denmark {{arrived at}} Poverty Bay and Burns was then engaged by the captain {{to continue as}} a flax trader at £3 a month. He agreed to establish himself further north at Uawa which was named Tolaga Bay by Captain James Cook. When he arrived at Uawa, Burns settled on the northern side of the Uawa river with Te Urunga Wera while on the southern side another white man traded for Captain John Rudolphus Kent with Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti. From 1832 to 1834 he sent about 107 tons of flax to Sydney and he considered these his happiest years in New Zealand. Burns {{claimed to have been}} made a chief of over 600. The remaining part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> parts of his body were tattooed at nearby Waihau (Loisels beach).|$|E
25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> incurred cuts {{on his face that}} cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E

25|$|Bill fights {{against the}} Death Eaters' attack at Hogwarts {{near the end}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, where he is {{attacked}} by werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who disfigures him. As Greyback was in human form {{at the time of the}} attack, Bill suffers only partial lycanthropy contamination—permanent scarring <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> an acquired liking for very rare beef. Fleur, who regards his wounds as a proud sign of his bravery, is adamant that their wedding proceed as scheduled, impressing Bill's family about the match's strength. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Fleur and Bill take part in getting Harry escorted safely from the Dursleys' house, and they witness Mad-Eye Moody being killed by Voldemort himself, which they announce upon their return to the Burrow. The couple have their wedding there and later provide safe haven for the trio and several others in their home, Shell Cottage. Both Bill and Fleur were combatants during the Battle of Hogwarts, and both survived the battle. Bill and Fleur later have three children: Victoire, Dominique and Louis.|$|E
25|$|In the Zohar {{there are}} more {{sections}} that are of different nature {{with regard to their}} contents and importance, as follows: Idra deVei Mashkana ("Assembly of the House of the Tabernacle") deals mainly with the secrets of prayer, and is found in the Zohar Vol. 2, parashat Mishpatim (pp.122b-123b). Heikhalot ("Palaces") deals in describing the palaces of Gan Eden, and Gehinom, and contains many matters related to prayer. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 1, parashat Bereishit (pp 38a-45b); Vol. 2 parashat Pekudei (pp.244b-262b, heikhalot of holiness; pp.262b-268b, heikhalot of impurity). Raza deRazin ("Secret of Secrets") deals with revealing the essence of a man via the features <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Yitro (pp.70a-75a). Saba deMishpatim ("The Elder on Statutes") is the commentary of Rav Yiba Saba regarding transmigration of souls, and punishments of the body in the grave. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Mishpatim (pp.94a-114a). Tosefta are paragraphs containing the beginnings of chapters on the wisdom of the Kabbalah of the Zohar, and it is dispersed in all three volumes of the Zohar. Sitrei Torah are drashas of verses from the Torah regarding matters of the soul and the secret of Divinity, and they are dispersed in the Zohar Vol. 1.|$|E
500|$|In Washington, {{the company}} was {{quartered}} in the Ladies' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in the Capitol. The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 {{became known as the}} First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name. While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how I was impressed by the kindliness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{atop the}} ridge {{on the eastern}} side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the {{accuracy}} of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, [...] "We now appear to be off the real continent edge." [...] Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed neuralgia on the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a whitlow on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.|$|E
500|$|Rymkus hired {{a stable}} of {{assistant}} coaches including Wally Lemm, Walt Schlinkman, Fred Wallner and former Browns teammate Speedie. The team {{was led by}} quarterback George Blanda, running back Billy Cannon and wide receiver Charlie Hennigan. As the regular season progressed, Houston built up a 10–4 record, setting up {{a meeting with the}} Chargers in the AFL championship game. The Oilers had lost to the Chargers in a November 13 game dubbed the [...] "Sawdust Game" [...] because sawdust was spread over the muddy and wet field in Los Angeles, but they entered the championship a six-and-a-half point favorite. Before the game, Rymkus was named the AFL's coach of the year. The Oilers went on to beat Gillman's Chargers 24–16 in the championship game on January 1, 1961. To commemorate the victory, Rymkus ordered thousands of drinking glasses emblazoned with a picture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> gave them to friends.|$|E
500|$|Vincent {{is shown}} as a tall, lean {{young man with}} long black hair and a ragged red cloak and mantle over black underclothes. He wears a metallic, golden {{gauntlet}} on his left forearm. Vincent's cloak covers the lower half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> is held closed {{by a series of}} buckles. His eyes are naturally red. His crimson cloak was added to symbolize the idea of Vincent carrying a heavy weight connected to death. While other characters were given simple costumes in Advent Children, Vincent was given something more complex. Nomura felt that changing his design to something complicated would [...] "conflict with his personality," [...] which is relatively straightforward, and he was thus given attire consisting of [...] "various, complex parts." [...] His cloak was difficult to animate due to it being very organic; the overall complexity of Vincent's design led to his scenes being [...] "especially hard to create." [...] These scenes were constantly being adjusted so as [...] "to convey [...] elusive nature of seemingly having shape, but not." [...] These adjustments concluded six months before the films completion.|$|E

500|$|Stan {{is portrayed}} as the everyman of the group, as the show's website {{describes}} him as an [...] "average, American 4th grader". Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt satirically. Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship, is a common topic throughout the series. Eric Cartman (usually nicknamed by his surname only) is loud, obnoxious, and amoral, often portrayed as an antagonist. His anti-Semitic attitude {{has resulted in a}} progressive rivalry with Kyle, although the deeper reason is the strong clash between Kyle's strong morality and Cartman's complete lack of such. Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> muffles his speech. During the show's first five seasons, Kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given. He was written out of the show's sixth season in 2002, re-appearing in the season finale. Since then, Kenny's death has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were in the third grade. In the season four episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] (2000), they entered the fourth grade, but have remained ever since.|$|E
2500|$|Crazy Horse's vision {{first took}} him to the South where, in Lakota spirituality, one goes upon death. He was brought back and was taken to the West in the {{direction}} of the wakiyans (thunder beings). He was given a medicine bundle to protect him for life. One of his animal protectors would be the white owl which, according to Lakota spirituality, would give extended life. He was also shown his [...] "face paint" [...] for battle, to consist of a yellow lightning bolt down the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> white powder. He would wet this and put marks over his vulnerable areas; when dried, the marks looked like hailstones. His face paint was similar to that of his father, who used a red lightning strike down the right side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> three red hailstones on his forehead. Crazy Horse put no make-up on his forehead and did not wear a war bonnet. Lastly, he was given a sacred song that is still sung by the Oglala people today and he was told he would be a protector of his people.|$|E
