40|$|Hong Kong is {{a crowded}} city where pavements, lanes, hawker areas, trunk roads and highway are closely built. With heavy traffic flow on complex road networks, the <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> {{located in the}} urban centre usually {{adjacent}} to commercial centres and residential buildings. The design of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> is therefore needed to be {{in harmony with the}} landscape of the neighbourhood. Different kinds of green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> systems combined with soil and vegetation had been developed across Europe and the USA in recent years. It is believed that an effective controller of noise shall be visually attractive especially for residents who are adjacent to the roads. A number of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> with vegetation were successfully implemented in European Countries. Nevertheless, these engineering techniques cannot be fully applied to Hong Kong due to the over-crowded living environment. A well-designed green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> system is the critical reason for successful application to sustain the vegetation and to insulate and absorb noise. The objective of this study to investigate different kinds of green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and come up with some guidelines for design consideration in order to optimize the green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> The study provides a thorough analysis of the available green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> systems across the world, including a look at all the potentials benefits from environmental and socio-economics perspectives. The pilot field measurement was conducted at Yeung Uk Road where green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> located between a heavily travelled main road and residential area in Tsuen Wan, to measure the SPL and Leq noise levels to assess the effectiveness of the green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> No significant attenuation effect is observed on the green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> which has to be attributed to the median placement and over-crowded urban environment. Online questionnaires and interviews are conducted to investigate the effects of vegetation on the perception of green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> Results show that 78 % of the respondents preferred vegetation rather than concrete (0. 1 %) and other materials. 77 % like the aesthetics appearance of vegetation and 86 % are willing to bear the cost. In general, 95 % of the respondents agreed green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> should be promoted in Hong Kong. The results assured that (1) vegetation on green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is aesthetically pleasing and mostly preferred; (2) people {{are willing to pay for}} green <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> for aesthetics; (3) aesthetic or vegetated screen is important in determining human response to noise which improved public perception of traffic noise due to visual and psychological relief. The outcome of the study indicated that it is feasible to promote green <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> in Hong Kong, with the evidence of the potential benefits, technical experience and public support.

40|$|This thesis {{recognises}} {{the implicit}} shortfalls {{in the current}} methods of <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> development. An holistic and integrative methodology was devised, which can be potentially incorporated into general practise, without the unnecessary burdens of excessive cost and environmental impacts. In essence the thesis defines, 'a sustainable approach to environmental <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> design'. The importance of sustainability as a key determinant of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier's</b> success is demonstrated through the impacts of public participation on the acceptance of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> This was achieved through the triangulation of a grounded theory, formulated through the qualitative analysis of a real case study and then tested quantitatively on a larger representative sample. The theory explored the impact of ineffective public participation on the perceived success of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> <b>Noise</b> maps were developed for the comparison of subjective opinions with objective facts. This also illustrated how this technology can be manipulated to focus public participation, and increase success. Demonstrating the utility of this growing resource beyond its current scope. A methodology for assessing the embodied impacts of <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> structures was also devised. By addressing the current lack of availability of a specific model, the means of choosing a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> based on sustainable assets was revealed. Finally, the thesis concluded with a laboratory experiment, which utilised a RAVE facility and revealed {{the extent to which}} preconceptions {{play a role in the}} perception of a noise barriers' effectiveness. Revealing that regardless of which <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is presented, that preconceptions of a materials' ability to attenuate noise are imbedded. The thesis contributed to several areas through the illustration of a sustainable approach to environmental <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> design.

40|$|The tall <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> {{recently}} {{installed on}} Shinkansen structures {{have a low}} natural frequency.

Conclusions on the basis of numerical studies are as follows: 1) the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> resonates with the yield frequency of structures during the L 2 earthquake, while it resonates with the elastic natural frequency of structures when structures respond elastically in such cases as L 1 earthquake.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{possibilities}} to reduce problems with traffic noise. One {{solution is to}} put up a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> There are obvious advantages with mounting a wall like barrier rather than a bank as the barrier needs less space and can be easily erected in almost any environment. However, as the barrier often is located in the immediate vicinity of the road, {{it is important that the}} barrier does not cause injuries or severe damage in case of a collision. This is essential not only for the vehicle occupants but also for other people on, or near, the road. Any road equipment located in the immediate surroundings of the road usually must be either safe to road users or protected by a safety barrier. There are international safety standards for <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> but they are somewhat imprecise regarding crash safety. In Sweden, safety barriers, lighting columns etc. are crash tested in accordance with international standards but <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> are normally not crash tested. Even though the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> has many visual similarities with a safety <b>barrier</b> the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is not necessarily constructed to break or redirect an errant vehicle. We are, in this case, only discussing the issue if the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is dangerous in case of an impact. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a wooden non-rigid crash tests <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> The results show that there was no intrusion into the occupant compartment in any of the tests. On the other hand major wooden pieces flew over a large area as a result of the impact. The top beam is also very rigid and proposes a safety hazard to occupants of high vehicles such as buses and lorries. Occupants in high vehicles, unprotected road users and people living near the road are being exposed to a greater risk with the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> compared to an ordinary safety barrier. This has to be taken into account when decisions regarding noise protection are taken. A <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> also creates a safety hazard that can not be evaluated by traditional crash testing. The area on the side of the road is normally less attractive both due to the noise and the immediate presence of the vehicles and as a result there are very few people there. Behind a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> the presence of the traffic is remarkably reduced both audible and visually. The area becomes more attractive and accessible. It is obvious that there may be an increase in the number of vulnerable road users adjacent to the road as a result of mounting the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> In addition, both drivers and the persons behind the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> will experience a false security as they cannot see each other...|$|R
