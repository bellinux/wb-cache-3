6000|$|... "I know, sir!" [...] exclaimed the Captain, {{who stood}} at the dunce's {{extremity}} of the line, holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> with true schoolboy eagerness.|$|E
60|$|John Harned replied nothing. He struck <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> He smote Luis Cervallos in {{the face}} so that he fell like a dead man across the chairs and did not rise again. He saw nothing of what followed. But I saw much. Urcisino Castillo, leaning forward from the next box, with his cane struck John Harned full across the face. And John Harned smote him with his fist so that in falling he overthrew General Salazar. John Harned was now in what-you-call Berserker rage--no? The beast {{primitive}} in him was loose and roaring--the beast primitive of the holes and caves of the long ago.|$|E
60|$|At first, when {{he opened}} his eyes, he fancied, from the sound of water in his ears, that it must have come on to rain very heavily, but, being {{regardless}} of rain, he tried to fall asleep again. Then he felt as if there must be a leak in his berth somewhere, he was so wet; but, being sleepy, he shut his eyes, and tried to shut his senses against moisture. Not succeeding, he resolved to turn on his other side, but experienced a strange resistance to that effort. Waxing testy, he wrenched himself round, and in so doing kicked out somewhat impatiently. This, of course, woke him up to the real state of the case. It also awoke Slagg, who received the kick on his shins. He, delivering a cry of pain straight into Sam Shipton's ear, caused that youth to fling <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> which fell on Stumps's nose, and thus in rapid succession were the sleepers roused effectually to a full sense of their condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me go!" [...] yelled Pelter, {{and tried}} to hurl Dick to one side. Then Japson struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> but the oldest Rover boy dodged.|$|R
60|$|Then {{coming up}} behind Crosby, the young oarsman let <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> right <b>fist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The taxi {{had stopped}} {{before the house}} in Sefton Park. An insensate impulse to remain seated and argue the point fought in Bob Pillin with an impulse to leap <b>out,</b> shake <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> in at the window, and walk off. He merely said, however: ...|$|R
5000|$|Moe holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> to Curly and says, [...] "See that?" [...] When Curly replies, [...] "Yeah," [...] he smacks {{the fist}} dismissively, {{in which it}} swings in a circle behind Moes body, over his head, and bops Curly {{on the head with}} it.|$|E
60|$|The instant {{his throat}} was released, Sheldon struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> and Carin-Jama joined his brother on the ground. The mutiny was quelled, and five minutes more saw the {{brothers}} being {{carried to the}} hospital, and the mutineers, marshalled by the gang-bosses, {{on the way to}} the fields.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, I {{knew they}} didn't like it! That's the boy, see him kick, he hits <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> {{like a good}} one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?" [...] cried Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, {{flapping}} aimlessly about.|$|R
60|$|All the hot {{blood of}} the Petawanaquats, from Adam downwards, seemed to leap through the red man's veins and {{concentrate}} {{in his right hand}} as he turned fiercely on the trader and drew his scalping-knife. Quick as lightning Ravenshaw hit <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> and knocked the Indian down, then, turning on his heel, walked away.|$|R
60|$|As {{he reached}} the street a man--an {{ordinary}} servant, to judge from his appearance--ran into him full tilt, and when they recoiled from the impact the fellow with a muttered curse raised <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and struck young Weldon a powerful blow. Reeling backward, a natural anger seized Arthur, who was inclined to be hot-headed, and he also struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> never pausing to consider that the more dignified act would be to call the police.|$|R
60|$|He got no further, {{for just}} then Koswell let <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> right <b>fist.</b> The blow landed on Tom's {{shoulder}} {{and sent him}} spinning away a distance of several feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{had already}} drawn nigh, {{attracted}} by idle curiosity, but now with one bound {{he reached the}} steps. Striking <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> at two or three men who barred the way, he suddenly stood confronting these miscreants, {{the light of the}} torch glowing on the rich silk of his doublet, the jewelled agraffe of his hat, his proud, serious face almost distorted by overwhelming wrath.|$|R
60|$|Had {{the blow}} landed as intended, our hero {{would have been}} knocked {{senseless}} and perhaps seriously hurt. But quick as the bully was, Dave was quicker, and leaped to one side. Then he let <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> landing on Jasniff’s jaw,—a blow that sent the fellow crashing over into a corner. As Jasniff came up, Dave hit him again, {{and this time he}} went down all but knocked out.|$|R
60|$|And {{so began}} Bunster's reign on Lord Howe. Three {{thousand}} {{people lived in}} the principal village; but it was deserted, even in broad day, when he passed through. Men, women, and children fled before him. Even the dogs and pigs {{got out of the}} way, while the king was not above hiding under a mat. The two prime ministers lived in terror of Bunster, who never discussed any moot subject, but struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> instead.|$|R
60|$|Gambouge {{caught at}} the notion, and hurried off a courier to Rome ventre à terre. His Holiness {{agreed to the}} request of the petition, and sent him an absolution, written <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> own <b>fist,</b> and all in due form.|$|R
6000|$|... "That for you!" [...] roared Sobber, {{and aimed}} a blow for Tom's eye. Tom dodged, {{and then let}} <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> right <b>fist.</b> The blow landed on the bully's chin. He tottered backward, lost his balance, and pitched down the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|Mary colored and laughed, {{but could}} not conceal that the tears were coming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles of his eyebrows falling, had an {{expression}} of mingled delight and sorrow as {{he returned to the}} opening of his letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her lips curling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to pass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang, [...] "She's an old brick, old brick, old brick!" [...] to a cantering measure, which he beat <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> on Mary's arm.|$|R
60|$|He rose at {{break of}} day, {{as he had}} once before done {{when he was in}} fear of Jacob, and took all gentle means to rouse this fatal brother from his deep sleep; he dared not be loud, because his {{apprentice}} was in the house, and would report everything. But Jacob was not to be roused. He fought <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> at the unknown cause of disturbance, turned over, and snored again. He must be left to wake as he would. David, with a cold perspiration on his brow, confessed to himself that Jacob could not be got away that day.|$|R
60|$|He {{was a good}} foot {{shorter than}} the mate and no match for him, but {{he was used to}} dealing with native crews, and he had his knuckle-duster handy. Perhaps it was not an {{instrument}} that a gentleman would use, but then Captain Butler was not a gentleman. Nor was he in the habit of dealing with gentlemen. Before Bananas knew what the captain was at, his right arm had shot <b>out</b> and <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> with its ring of steel, caught him fair and square on the jaw. He fell like a bull under the pole-axe.|$|R
50|$|Vimes {{often has}} to go to report to Lord Vetinari, {{although}} {{most of the time he}} keeps a poker-face and answers very simply to avoid Vetinari's probing questions. When given bad news, he has a tendency to, on <b>his</b> way <b>out,</b> pound <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> against a certain spot of wall near the office door. Though he sometimes has to call in a plasterer when Vimes is particularly angry, Vetinari doesn't worry about it—a sign that he intentionally angers Vimes so as to goad him into a desired action. When Vimes was temporarily relieved of command in Men At Arms, the fact that Vimes didn't pound the wall led Vetinari to realize that he 'may have gone too far'.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{man that}} had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down over his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged and his south end {{sticking}} <b>out</b> far, and <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> a-shoving <b>out</b> and drawing in in front of him, and so went around in a little circle about three times, swelling himself up and breathing hard. Then he straightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, before he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like this-- ...|$|R
500|$|Weapon XI is {{a genetically}} altered mutant killer. He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, {{as well as}} {{retractable}} blades in his arms. He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the pool, the mutant killer: Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. This interpretation of Deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask, and also includes a mouth sewn shut and the abilities of Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation, and samurai swords that come <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> from within <b>his</b> arms, similarly to Wolverine's claws. [...] Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins {{is used for the}} more complicated and dangerous stunt work.|$|R
60|$|And Mauki {{soon learned}} that there were white men and white men. On the very day the {{schooner}} departed {{he was ordered to}} buy a chicken from Samisee, the native Tongan missionary. But Samisee had sailed across the lagoon and would not be back for three days. Mauki returned with the information. He climbed the steep stairway (the house stood on piles twelve feet above the sand), and entered the living room to report. The trader demanded the chicken. Mauki opened his mouth to explain the missionary's absence. But Bunster did not care for explanations. He struck <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> The blow caught Mauki on the mouth and lifted him into the air. Clear through the doorway he flew, across the narrow veranda, breaking the top railing, and down to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "You low, London gutter-hound!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "I'll learn you {{to insult}} the Lady Harflete with your ribald japes," [...] and {{stretching}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> big <b>fist</b> he seized <b>his</b> enemy's purple nose in a grip {{of iron and}} began to twist it till the sot roared with pain. Thereon guards ran up and would have arrested Bolle for breaking the peace in the King's palace. Indeed, arrested he must have been, notwithstanding all Jacob Smith could do to save him, had not at that moment a man appeared at whose coming the crowd that had gathered, separated, bowing; a man of middle age with a quick, clever face, who wore rich clothes and a fur-trimmed velvet cap and gown.|$|R
60|$|This {{was just}} what Bumpus had {{intended}} and hoped for. The sudden fall of so many gave him time to launch <b>out</b> <b>his</b> great <b>fists</b> a second time. They fell {{with the weight of}} sledge-hammers on the faces of two more of his opponents, flattening their noses, and otherwise disfiguring their features, besides stretching them on the ground. At the same time, Corrie flung his empty pistol {{in the face of a}} man who attempted to assault his companion on the right flank unawares, and laid him prone on the earth. Another savage, who made the same effort on the left, received a gash on the thigh from the broken sabre that sent him howling from the scene of conflict.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Marvel, released, {{suddenly}} {{dropped to}} the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men. The struggle blundered round the edge of the door. The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time, yelling out sharply, as the policeman trod on his foot. Then he cried <b>out</b> passionately and <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> flew round like flails. The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up, kicked under the diaphragm. The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel's retreat. The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air.|$|R
5000|$|In his 2012 memoir My Cross to Bear, Gregg Allman {{confirms}} that {{several aspects of}} the movie are directly based on Crowe's time spent with the Allman Brothers Band. The scene in which Russell jumps {{from the top of}} the Topeka party house into a pool was based on something Duane Allman did: [...] "the jumping off the roof into the pool, that was Duane—from the third floor of a place called the Travelodge in San Francisco. My brother wanted to do it again, but the cat who owned the place came <b>out</b> shaking <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> yelling at him. We told that story all the time, and I have no doubt that Cameron was around for it." [...] He also {{confirms that}} he and Dickey Betts played a joke on Crowe by claiming clauses in their contract did not allow his story to be published — just before he was to deliver it to Rolling Stone.|$|R
6000|$|Hector, left alone, {{contracts}} his brows, {{and falls}} into a day-dream. He does not move for some time. Then he folds his arms. Then, throwing his hands behind him, and gripping one with the other, he strides tragically once to and fro. Suddenly he snatches his walking stick from the teak table, and draws it; for it is a swordstick. He fights a desperate duel with an imaginary antagonist, and after many vicissitudes runs him through the body up to the hilt. He sheathes his sword and throws it on the sofa, falling into another reverie as he does so. He looks straight {{into the eyes of}} an imaginary woman; seizes her by the arms; and says in a deep and thrilling tone, [...] "Do you love me!" [...] The captain comes out of the pantry at this moment; and Hector, caught with <b>his</b> arms stretched <b>out</b> and <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> clenched, has to account for his attitude by going through a series of gymnastic exercises.|$|R
60|$|William had {{got into}} the carriage, {{released}} from the embraces of his landlord. George bounded in afterwards, and flung his arms round the Major's neck (as they saw from the window), and began asking him multiplied questions. Then he felt in his waistcoat pocket {{and gave him a}} note. William seized at it rather eagerly, he opened it trembling, but instantly his countenance changed, and he tore the paper in two and dropped it out of the carriage. He kissed Georgy on the head, and the boy got <b>out,</b> doubling <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> into <b>his</b> eyes, and with the aid of Francis. He lingered with his hand on the panel. Fort, Schwager! The yellow postilion cracked his whip prodigiously, up sprang Francis to the box, away went the schimmels, and Dobbin with his head on his breast. He never looked up as they passed under Amelia's window, and Georgy, left alone in the street, burst out crying {{in the face of all}} the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Rateau saw him too--came face to {{face with}} him, in fact, and must have known who he was for, without an instant's {{hesitation}} and just like a hunted creature at bay, he turned sharply on his heel and then ran back down the street {{as hard as he could}} tear. He passed close to within half a metre of Tournefort, and as he flew past he hit <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> left <b>fist</b> so vigorously that the worthy agent of the Committee of Public Safety, caught on the nose by the blow, staggered and measured his length upon the flagged floor below.|$|R
60|$|He spoke quickly, jerking <b>out</b> <b>his</b> words through closed teeth, {{his eyes}} burning with inward fever, <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> closing and unclosing with rapid febrile {{movements}} of the fingers.|$|R
50|$|Père Surin, whom I myself {{knew for}} twenty years or more, led so {{deranged}} and shameful a life that one hardly dares speak of it. In the end it {{reached the point where}} the most wise attributed it all, quite correctly I believe, to madness … I have often seen him blaspheme the name of God and walk about naked in the College, soiled with excrement - I would then take him by the hand into the infirmary. I have seen him lashing <b>out</b> with <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and for years perform a hundred other insanities, {{even to the point of}} trying to trample on the Sacrament of the Eucharist - I did not see this myself but learnt it the next day from witnesses. He lived like this for several years. For the rest of his life, he never fulfilled any function within the Society. When he recovered self-control, he wrote books and letters, visited his neighbor and spoke very well about God, but he never said his prayers, or read his Breviary, said Mass rarely and to his dying day mumped about and gesticulated in a ridiculous and absurd fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Uud mit dot he went indo his dent, unt brung <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{big book}} of Yates; der Sherman Flag grawlin' in <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> [...] "Yates haf said," [...] said Reingelder, und he throwed oben der book in der fork of <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> und read der passage, proofin' conglusivement dot nefer coral-shnake bite vas boison. Den he shut der book mit a bang, und dot shqueeze der Sherman Flag, und she nip once und dwice.|$|R
6000|$|... [EVANS {{throws up}} <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> parries the blow, and returns it. [...] They fight. The bargemen are seen {{holding up the}} lantern and [...] enjoying the sight. Old THOMAS steps forward and holds <b>out</b> <b>his</b> [...] hands.] ...|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, Ned Frog {{staggered}} <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> own doorway, clenched <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> {{and looked}} with a vindictive scowl at the strangers. A second glance induced him to unclench <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and reel {{round the corner}} {{on his way to}} a neighbouring grog-shop. Whatever other shops may decay in that region, the grog-shops, like noxious weeds, always flourish.|$|R
