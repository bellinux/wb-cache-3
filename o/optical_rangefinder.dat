5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
25|$|The {{warships}} of the Regia Marina had {{a general}} reputation as being well-designed. Italian small attack craft {{lived up to}} expectations and were responsible for many successful actions in the Mediterranean. Though Italian warships lacked radar, this was partly offset in fair weather by good <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and fire-control systems.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} of T95 tank, {{it became clear that}} it would not have a significant advantage over the M48A2. The X-shaped motor and <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which {{led to the creation of}} the fairly successful M60A1 turret.|$|E
50|$|Early in World War II, {{the range}} {{to the target}} was {{measured}} by <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders.</b> Though some night operations were conducted using searchlights and star shells, in general <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders</b> were limited to daytime operation. During {{the latter part of}} World War II, radar was used to determine the range to the target. Radar proved to be more accurate than the <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders</b> (at least under operational conditions) and was the preferred way to determine target range during both night and day.|$|R

50|$|Between the American Civil War and 1905, {{numerous}} small improvements, such as telescopic {{sights and}} <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> {{were made in}} fire control. There were also procedural improvements, like the use of plotting boards to manually predict {{the position of a}} ship during an engagement.|$|R
25|$|A stadimeter, {{a type of}} <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> is {{an optical}} device for {{estimating}} the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between {{the top and bottom}} of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy, United States Navy, and Imperial Japanese Navy {{extensively}} upgraded and modernized their World War I–era battleships {{during the}} 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) {{to protect against}} plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the [...] "Queen Anne's castle", {{such as in the}} [...] and , which would be used in the new conning towers of the [...] fast battleships. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive [...] "pagoda" [...] structures, though the [...] received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new [...] Bulges were fitted, including steel tube arrays to improve both underwater and vertical protection along the waterline. The U.S. experimented with cage masts and later tripod masts, though after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor some of the most severely damaged ships (such as [...] and [...] ) were rebuilt with tower masts, for an appearance similar to their [...] contemporaries. Radar, which was effective beyond visual range and effective in complete darkness or adverse weather, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.|$|E
2500|$|T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] (Ob'yekt 172M) (1973): Original version, {{armed with}} 125mm D-81TM smoothbore tank gun. Unlike the later {{versions}} {{it had the}} searchlight mounted on left. It also has flipper type armour panels. It had the TPD-2-49 coincidence <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> sight protruding from its turret.|$|E
500|$|Turrets 2 and 3 had <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders</b> and {{ballistics}} computers. [...] (The rangefinders are {{the boxes}} on the turret's rear corners). If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged, the Turret Officer {{could turn the}} Auto-Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the turret's fire control equipment.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to US radar aided system, the Japanese relied on averaging <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> lacked gyros {{to sense the}} horizon, and required manual handling of follow-ups on the Sokutekiban, Shagekiban, Hoiban as well as guns themselves. This could {{have played a role}} in Center Force’s battleships' dismal performance in the Battle off Samar in October 1944.|$|R
50|$|Once {{some shots}} had been fired, {{spotters}} would report {{the fall of}} shell (which could be observed {{because of the large}} waterspouts where the shells hit the sea) and the range would be corrected up or down depending whether the shells were short or over the enemy.

2500|$|T-72A (Ob'yekt 176) (1979): An {{improved}} {{version of}} the basic T-72 [...] "Ural". Overall, its offensive capabilities {{are similar to the}} basic T-72 [...] "Ural", but it is much better protected. The differences between T-72 [...] "Ural" [...] and T-72A include the searchlight being placed on the right hand side of turret, the TPD-2-49 coincidence <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder</b> being replaced by the TPD-K1 laser rangefinder, added plastic armour track skirts covering {{the upper part of the}} suspension with separate panels protecting the sides of the fuel and stowage panniers instead of the flipper type armor panels used in T-72 [...] "Ural", the turret front and top being heavily reinforced with composite armour better known by its US codename - [...] "Dolly Parton", provisions for mounting reactive armor, an electronic fire control system, MB smoke grenade launchers, flipper armour mount on front mudguards, internal changes, and a slight weight increase.|$|E

50|$|Human {{observers}} {{were required to}} determine the angle on the bow.

50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>rangefinders</b> {{using this}} principle, while {{applicable}} to several purposes, were widely used for military purposes—determining {{the range of}} a target—and for photographic use, determining the distance of a subject to photograph to allow focussing on it.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a CMOS array of 64 48 pixels capable of detecting single photons with timing accuracies better than 80 ps. Upon photon arrival, a digital pulse is generated and routed by an event-driven digital readout scheme {{to a specific}} location for further processing. This method allows non-sequential row-wise and simultaneous column-wise detection while preserving photon arrival timing information. The readout scheme is scalable and it is shown to have minimal impact on timing accuracy. Time-correlated fluorescence spectroscopy and <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinders</b> are among the target applications for this technology. I...|$|R

50|$|In mid-1973 a new turret was {{designed}} by Wegmann saving 1.5 t weight. It was nicknamed the Spitzmaus-Turm (shrew turret) due to the highly sloped front. This design was only possible with the new EMES-13 <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> which required a base length of only 350 mm instead of the previous 1720 mm. Based on experiences in the Yom Kippur War, {{a higher level of}} protection than the prototypes' heavily sloped spaced armour was demanded in late 1973 and the Spitzmaus-Turm was never produced. The weight limit was increased from MLC50 to MLC60, which equals approximately 55 t. The turret T14 was modified to test a new armour configuration, taking on a blockier-looking appearance as a result of using vertical modules of spaced multilayer armour. It was also used to test the new EMES-13 <b>optical</b> <b>rangefinder.</b> The modified turret T14 was designated T14 mod. and was fitted with a fully electric turret drive and stabilization system, which was developed together by the companies General Electric and AEG Telefunken.|$|E
