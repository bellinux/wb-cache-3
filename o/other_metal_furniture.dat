40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} how physical features of a natural setting influenced perceived coherence and three positive outcome variables: preference, pleasure, and (self-reported) restoration. Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of perceived coherence. One hundred thirty-one students evaluated three (virtual) natural environments: an environment with <b>metal</b> <b>furniture,</b> an environment with wooden furniture, and an environment without furniture. Results showed that <b>metal</b> <b>furniture</b> negatively influenced perceived coherence as well as preference, pleasure and restoration, compared to wooden furniture and no furniture. Perceived coherence of the environment with wooden furniture {{was significantly higher than}} the environment with <b>metal</b> <b>furniture,</b> but significantly lower than the environment without furniture. We did not find support that preference for, and experienced pleasure and restoration in the environment with wooden furniture differed from the environment without furniture. Perceived coherence mediated the effect of (<b>metal)</b> <b>furniture</b> on preference, pleasure, and restoration. Scientific and practical implications are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Steel {{furniture}} is typically pricier {{when it is}} used as furniture, with the price varying according {{to the type of}} metal and thickness. However, it is hard to identify it after a finish is applied. Steel has low, medium or high carbon, with most <b>metal</b> <b>furniture</b> being made with low carbon because it is cheaper than a higher grade of carbon. Stainless steel is good for low maintenance. Made of an alloy of carbon, iron and <b>other</b> <b>metals,</b> its main reason for its strength is because of chromium, which protects from rust and corrosion because of its thin film of oxide on the surface.|$|R
