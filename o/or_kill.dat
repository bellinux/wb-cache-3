5|$|A female was {{observed}} placing {{leaves of the}} flaky-barked tea-tree (Leptospermum trinervium) underneath its feathers, leading the observers to wonder whether they were being used to deter <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> insects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the game}} has {{interrogation}} sequences involving questioning (or torturing) targets, {{it does not have}} Conviction interactive torture scenes. Players can still decide whether to spare their targets <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> them after interrogation, and these decisions influence the relationship between Fisher and other crew members.|$|E
5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed that bin Laden was hiding in the rugged mountains at Tora Bora. Despite overrunning the Taliban and al-Qaeda positions, they failed to capture <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Nhu {{tried to}} assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb. As a result, Sihanouk {{routinely}} gave asylum to political refugees {{who had tried}} to depose <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> Diệm. In November 1960, he had given asylum to a group of paratroopers who tried to depose Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> young, and hawks and cats, which {{pose a threat}} to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} renewed calls {{by many in}} Japan for the United States to {{make more}} effort in reducing crimes and accidents involving U.S. military personnel who injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> Japanese citizens. In response to the accident, the Navy changed its policies regarding civilian visits to its ships.|$|E
5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
5|$|As the {{fortress}} expands and develops, new noble positions become available. While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch <b>or</b> <b>kill.</b> Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|During Taraki's foreign {{visit to}} the non-aligned conference in Cuba, his Gang of Four had {{received}} an intelligence report that Amin was planning to arrest <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> them. This report, it turned out, was incorrect. Nonetheless, the Gang of Four were ordered to assassinate Amin, its leader Sarwari selecting his nephew Aziz Akbari to conduct the assassination. However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E
5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing {{to fight for}} the {{independence}} of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia, it is {{advisable}} {{to take the}} snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along {{to the hospital for}} possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> bin Laden, {{both of which were}} unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
5|$|Most {{end users}} of {{forecasts}} {{are members of}} the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread hail damage. Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken <b>or</b> <b>kill</b> those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.|$|E
