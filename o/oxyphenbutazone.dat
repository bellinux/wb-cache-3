40|$|Fixed drug {{eruption}} (FDE) {{is common}} type of drug eruption seen in skin clinics. FDE usually occurs within hours of administration of the offending agent.

40|$|Among the {{pleiotropic}} {{effects of}} human interferon are the inhibition of viral replication, the activation of natural killer cells, and the inhibition of cellular growth. <b>Oxyphenbutazone,</b> a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, {{is a potent}} inhibitor of the antiviral activity of human alpha and beta interferons as determined by cytopathic effect and vesicular stomatitis virus synthesis and release in human foreskin fibroblasts. The inhibition of interferon activity is dose dependent with maximal inhibition at 25 - 50 microM and minimal inhibition at 1 microM. In contrast, <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> at concentrations as high as 100 microM {{has no effect on}} the activation of natural killer cells by human interferon. Similarly, <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> has no inhibitory effect on interferon-induced antigrowth activity in the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB- 231. This cell line is sensitive to <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> inhibition of interferon-induced antiviral activity in vitro. In another human cell line, the vulvar carcinoma A 431, <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> apparently augments the antigrowth activity of interferon. Although <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> inhibits the fatty acid cyclooxygenase enzyme in these systems, other inhibitors of cyclooxygenase fail to inactivate the antiviral activity of human interferon. Thus, <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> appears to inhibit the interferon antiviral cascade at a site distinct from prostaglandin biosynthesis. Moreover, the failure to inhibit natural killer cell activation or cellular antigrowth effects of human interferon suggests a pathway different from that associated with the antiviral effect of human interferon...|$|E
40|$|Phenylbutazone in {{doses of}} 200, 300 and 400 mg/day was {{administered}} chronically to six rheumatoid arthritic patients. At each steady-state the plasma levels of phenylbutazone, <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> and gamma-hydroxyphenylbutazone {{as well as}} the extents of binding of phenylbutazone and <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> to plasma proteins were measured. 2 Plasma concentrations of phenylbutazone did not increase proportionally with dose but when corrected for protein binding unbound concentrations of phenylbutazone did show a proportional increase with dose. 3 Plasma concentrations of <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> decreased with an increase in phenylbutazone dose suggesting either that the elimination of <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> is stimulated or its formation inhibited after chronic administration of phenylbutazone. 4 Binding studies with human serum albumin demonstrated the ability of phenylbutazone and <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> to mutually displace one another. Neither saturation of the protein binding sites nor displacement interactions could account for the changes in binding shown by phenylbutazone with increased dose. 5 gamma-hydroxyphenylbutazone concentrations increased proportionally with phenylbutazone dose reaching 68 % of the phenylbutazone concentration in one patient. There was a large inter-subject variation in the gamma-hydroxyphenylbutazone concentrations...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} controlled {{trial was}} carried out to test the value of <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> (Tandearil; Geigy Pharmaceuticals) in preventing the troublesome edema of external genitalia that may occasionally develop after bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. <b>Oxyphenbutazone,</b> 200 mg., or a placebo identical in appearance, was given orally to each of 133 patients the day before their first operation and 300 mg. was administered on each subsequent day until discharge.

40|$|The {{histories}} of 269 patients whose death certificates {{did not mention}} a drug {{as the cause of}} aplastic anaemia or agranulocytosis were investigated. Eighty-three deaths were probably caused by drugs, {{the most common cause of}} aplastic anaemia being treatment with phenylbutazone (28 deaths) and <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> (11 deaths). Thirteen out of 17 deaths from agranulocytosis were attributed to co-trimoxazole treatment. A separate survey of general practitioners' prescriptions enabled the mortality to be estimated. With the addition of one death due to <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> and four deaths due to phenylbutazone that were reported independently to the committee, the mortality from <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> was 3 - 8 per 100 000 and from phenylbutazone 2 - 2 per 100 000. With phenylbutazone the rates varied from under 1 death per 100 000 for men aged under 65 years to 6 per 100 000 for women aged 65 and over.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{metabolism}} of the anti-arthritic drug, phenylbutazone, {{was investigated in}} female Wistar rats, and the results {{compared with those of}} other workers in this field. Two interrelated projects were undertaken. The first covered the pattern of excretion, isolation and characterisation of the metabolites and decomposition products of phenylbutazone in rats dosed post-orally with the drug. It was found that the major route of excretion was via the urine and over 50 % of the administered dose was excreted in the first 24 hours by this route. A small percentage of the dose was excreted in the faeces. The following compounds were identified using chromatographic and autoradiographic techniques: p-Hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone γ-Hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone in both its molecular forms (ring lactone and straight chain hydroxyl) 4 -Hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone p-γ-Dihydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone p- 4 -Dihydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone Hydrolysable conjugates (possibly glucuronides) Water soluble non-hydrolysable conjugates. The second project dealt with the quantitation of the water insoluble compounds isolated in the initial work. Using a unique technique, combining inverse isotope dilution assay and spectrophotometric analysis, {{it was found that the}} major metabolite was the γ-hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone, present in both its molecular forms. <b>Oxyphenbutazone</b> was a minor metabolite and the p-γ-dihydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone was present only in very low concentration. These results did not conform with those of previous workers in this field who reported the γ-hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone, in one molecular form only, as the major metabolite and the dihydroxy derivative as the second metabolite with a higher concentration in the urine than <b>oxyphenbutazone.</b> This disparity could be due to the fact that these workers took no account of the presence of the two molecular forms of the γ-hydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone with their different polarities and different Rf values. The present study showed that the straight chain hydroxyl isomer was probably mistakenly identified as the p-γ-dihydroxy derivative of phenylbutazone. This theory is supported by the fact that the percentage dose recovered by the previous workers of the γ-hydroxy and p-γ-dihydroxy derivatives together equalled the percentage dose recovered in this study of the two molecular forms of the γ-hydroxy derivative.

The present author carefully re-examined this method with special consideration on the experimental conditions and the reproducibility of the results. The inflammatory edema was induced in animals by the intracutaneous injection of anti-rat rabbit serum, serotonin, bradykinin, dextran, carrageenin, formalin (in rats) and histamine (in guinea pigs). It was found that the weight increase (edema intensity) of the skin induced by phlogogenic substances is related with the body weight of animals, the caliber of the punch and the pH of the vehicle in which irritants are dissolved. Satisfactory results were obtained with the use of male rats weighing 150 ± 10 g, the punch of 12 mm caliber, and 0. 9 % physiological saline adjusted to pH 7. 2 as the vehicle. As the skin could be punched out from 4 test sites and 4 control sites of one animal, it was possible to estimate the edema intensity with good reproducibility of the results using {{a relatively small number of}} animals. There was found a linear correlation between log doses of the phlogogenic substance and the weight increase of skin. A linear correlation was also obtained between the log doses of the anti-inflammatory agents tested and the percentage inhibition of weight increase of inflamed skin. With respect to anti-rat rabbit serum edema, the anti-inflammatory effect of <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> was somewhat longer lasting than that of phenylbutazone. Peroral phenylbutazone was slightly more effective than intramuscular. These results reflect well the course of blood level of these agents reported in rats as well as in man. The author depicted log dose-effect curves of 7 kinds of glucocorticoids and of 12 non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents of current clinical use. The order of the anti-inflammatory potency of these compounds coincided with the order of the clinical effect surmised on the basis of doses. Phenylbutazone, <b>oxyphenbutazone,</b> hydrocortizone, prednisolone, dexamethazone, chloroquine, aminopyrine and aspirin also showed clear inhibitory effects on the inflammatory edema induced by histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and dextran. Discussion was made on the simplified experimental design with this method, for the anti-inflammatory screening of newly synthesized compounds, with some concrete examples...|$|E
40|$|About 80 {{percent of}} {{sarcoidosis}} cases are benign {{and do not}} require treatment, but 20 percent will have chronic unremitting disease for which therapy is essential. It {{is important that the}} physician identify this group and begin therapy promptly. If the disease is active, treat. If it is inactive, do not treat. Activity depends upon three major tests: serum angiotensin converting enzyme, gallium 67 scan, and bronchoalveolar lavage. The other consideration is involvement of vital organ systems; ie, active ocular disease, progressive pulmonary involvement as evidenced by increasing symptoms, impaired and deteriorating pulmonary function, or radiographic changes; hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria; central nervous system involvement; disfiguring cutaneous lesions; and myocardial sarcoidosis. Following a therapeutic decision to treat, adrenocorticoids are the drugs of choice. Methylprednisolone, prednisone, and cortisol are listed in order of benefit. Alternate day and/or low-dose steroids are increasing in popularity. Chloroquine phosphate is beneficial for skin lesions, while <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> {{has been found to be}} at least as effective as prednisone. Immunosuppressives may be used also. Chlorambucil and azathioprine have shown variable results. Cyclosporine (Cyclosporin A) shows promise and is now undergoing therapeutic trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> (OPB) {{in the control}} of postoperative inflammation was investigated, and previous findings were extended on {{the rate at which}} the inflammatory response of plasma seromucoids was significantly modified by this drug. Eighty - five surgical patients (hemorrhoidectomy, 39; vaginal hysterectomy, 23; tonsillectomy, 14; submucosal resection of nasal cavity, 9) were studied by the double-blind method. OPB was administered orally in a daily dosage of 400 mg. with a priming dose on the evening before surgery. Effective control of postsurgical inflammation was achieved in 34 of 46 treated subjects as compared with similar results in eight of 39 controls. Control of postoperative pain was pronounced when OPB was used. One patient developed an urticarial rash. Chemical studies were carried out in 65 surgical patients (39 treated with OPB; 26 controls). In the postoperative phase, mean plasma seromucoid values increased from presurgical levels by 39 % in controls and by 13. 9 % in OPB-treated subjects. Hence, results of this clinical trial clearly demonstrate the usefulness of OPB in the control of postsurgical inflammation. Moreover, results of the chemical studies are in accordance with those previously obtained in animals...|$|E
40|$|Equine {{medication}} regulation {{rules have}} been established to prevent a horse's performance being altered after the administration of prohibited substances or approved therapeutic medications used for legitimate treatment. Phenylbutazone (PBZ) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used in equine medicine {{and is one of}} the most frequently identified medications in the anti-doping controls. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma elimination kinetic of PBZ in healthy horses after both intravenous and oral administration of two commercial products. Phenylbutazone was administered to horses intravenously or orally at a dose rate of 4. 4 mg/kg once daily for five consecutive days. Blood (10 mL) samples were collected before the last dose (t 0); and then after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours; and every 12 hours for 10 days after treatment. Plasma levels of PBZ and its major metabolite <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector (limit of detection [LOD] = 0. 005 μg/mL). The detection time obtained in this study by both intravenous and oral PBZ administration by using a LOD of 0. 005 μg/mL was 84 hours. Using the dose regimen reported here, a withdrawal time of 5 days could be a correct approach to be adopted for the use of PBZ in performance horses...|$|E
40|$|The use of nonsteroidal {{antiinflammatory}} {{drugs in}} racehorses is allowed under most jurisdictions. Furosemide is administered to treat exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. To help distinguish between therapeutic and illegal uses, racing regulatory bodies have set thresholds in serum for several drugs. The method for the simul-taneous detection and quantification of furosemide, flunixin, ketopro-fen, phenylbutazone and <b>oxyphenbutazone</b> using 500 mL of serum, and liquid extraction using diethyl ether: hexanes: dichloromethane followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quan-titation, {{was developed and}} validated. Method validation included inter- and intraday precision and accuracy. Method validation also included bench-top, freeze–thaw, processed and long-term storage stability testing. For all stability testing, the compounds showed a breakdown of < 15 %. Inter- and intraday precision for all compounds {{was found to be}} within the acceptance interval of + 15 % [+ 20 % at the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) ]. Accuracy data for all com-pounds were within the acceptance interval of + 15 % (+ 20 % at the LLOQ). Uncertainty was calculated using the simplified Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement approach and was < 30 % for all drugs at 95 % confidence level. The method was found to be both robust and accurate for all tested drugs...|$|E
