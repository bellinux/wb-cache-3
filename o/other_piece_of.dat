25|$|Hennepin County {{claimed that}} {{accepting}} the price set by an eminent domain judge {{was not an}} option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.|$|E
500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe {{the whole thing was}} becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing in comparison to the [...] "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the south}} side of town, a Confederate {{artillery}} crew led by Captain John M. Oliver struggled to find horses to move their two artillery pieces. Finally securing horses, they moved toward Main Street with their two large weapons. Captain Gilmore, from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, became aware of the artillery threat, while a small group of Confederate soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Henry Bozang rushed to protect the artillery and its crew. [...] A combined force of cavalry and infantry, led by Lieutenant Abraham from Gillmore's Company, charged through Bozang's men while the artillery crew hurriedly tried to load their weapons. The Confederate artillerists were able to fire one shot, but its main effect was to cause the horses still attached to the <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> artillery to panic and pull it over. Before the remaining artillery piece could be reloaded, Abraham's men captured it while killing Oliver and two gunners. The remaining artillery crew fled. Lieutenant Bozang was wounded and his command surrendered.|$|E
500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body [...] the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E
500|$|Linguistic {{amendments}} {{were also}} included; {{the line in}} the preamble emphasising that authors possessed books as they would any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> property was dropped, and the bill moved from something designed [...] "for Securing the Property of Copies of Books to the rightful Owners thereof" [...] to a bill [...] "for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies". Another amendment allowed anyone to own and trade in copies of books, undermining the Stationers. Other changes were made when the bill went to the House of Lords, and it was finally returned to the Commons on 5 April. The aims of the resulting statute are debated; Ronan Deazley suggests that the intent was to balance the rights of the author, publisher and public {{in such a way as}} to ensure the maximum dissemination of works, while other academics argue that the bill was intended to protect the Company's monopoly or, conversely, to weaken it. Oren Bracha, writing in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, says that when considering which of these options are correct, [...] "the most probable answer [...] all of them". Whatever the motivations, the bill was passed on 5 April 1710, and is commonly known simply as the Statute of Anne due its passage during the reign of Queen Anne.|$|E

2500|$|The American {{hamburger}} {{may have}} developed from Hamburg's Frikadeller: a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) {{made from a}} mixture of ground beef, soaked stale bread, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> meat, not usually on a bun.

2500|$|In 1815, Claude Thory, a {{respected}} French scientist and Freemason, claimed that Robert the Bruce {{had created the}} Order of St. Andrew for masons who had supported him at Bannockburn, which was later joined to the Order of Heredom, which he founded at Kilwinning. In 1837, a Scottish Freemason called James Burnes, in attempting to revive a Scottish order of [...] "Knights Templar", [...] expanded the masonic link to Bannockburn. He introduced the Knights Templar as the bearers on Freemasonry to Scotland, and had the Templars play a crucial part in the battle. This {{appears to be the}} basis of subsequent tales of Templar involvement at Bannockburn. The contemporary Royal Order of Scotland makes use of a similar foundation myth, which is no more intended to be taken as historical fact than any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> masonic allegory.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they are}} used {{occasionally}} in classical music, typically in an educational setting for harmonic analysis, these names and symbols are [...] "universally used in jazz and popular music", in lead sheets, fake books, and chord charts, to specify the chords {{that make up the}} chord progression of a song or <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music. A typical sequence of a jazz or rock song in the key of C major might indicate a chord progression such as [...] "C – Am – Dm – G7". This chord progression instructs the performer to play, in sequence, a [...] "C Major" [...] chord, an [...] "a minor" [...] chord, a [...] "d minor" [...] chord, and a [...] "G dominant seventh" [...] chord. In a jazz context, players have the freedom to add sevenths, ninths and higher extensions to the chord. In some pop, rock and folk genres, triads are generally performed unless specified in the chord chart (e.g., C Major 7).|$|E
2500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Were God {{not with}} us at this time), is a chorale fantasia on the hymn tune. Luther's hymn is sung to the same melody as [...] "" [...] by Justus Jonas, which Bach had treated to a chorale cantata, [...] The opening chorus is an unusual {{composition}} that does not follow the scheme of instrumental ritornellos with a cantus firmus, sung line by line by the soprano in long notes. In a setting resembling a motet, the strings play colla parte with the voices, and each line of the chorale is prepared by a complex four-part counter-fugue, in which the first entrance of a theme is answered in its inversion. After preparing entrances, the chorale melody is not sung but played by the horn and the oboes in long notes, creating a five-part composition, which is unique in Bach's cantata movements. The only <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> similar complexity, also giving the cantus firmus to the instruments, is the opening chorus of , {{but it is not}} conceived as a counter-fugue.|$|E
