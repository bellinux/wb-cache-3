40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} age-related differences in electrophysiological signatures of sequential modulations <b>of</b> <b>poorer</b> strategy effects. Sequential modulations <b>of</b> <b>poorer</b> strategy effects refer to decreased poorer strategy effects (i. e., poorer performance when the cued strategy {{is not the}} best) on current problem following poorer strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential modulations <b>of</b> <b>poorer</b> strategy effects. More specifically, sequential modulations <b>of</b> <b>poorer</b> strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i. e., between 200 - and 550 ms and between 850 - and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential modulations <b>of</b> <b>poorer</b> strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these modulations were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.
