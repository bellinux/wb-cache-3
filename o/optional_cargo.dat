30|$|What is {{mentioned}} above describes the original problem in tramp shipping. In turning {{some or all}} the characteristics of ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ referred to in this problem into an OR model, the following research efforts were cited. A general review is given by Christiansen et al. (2004), Christiansen et al. (2013), and Christiansen and Fagerholt (2014). Appelgren (1969, 1971) addressed the problem of tramp shipping for a fleet of cargo ships. The problem of these research papers is to assign an optimal loading sequence of cargoes to each ship during a given time. Each cargo has a loading time window, size, type, port of loading, port of discharging, and cargo handling time in these ports. Each ship has its operational characteristics of the initial position, and expected daily marginal revenue of <b>optional</b> <b>cargoes</b> which may become available during the planning period. All contracted cargoes must be loaded, whereas <b>optional</b> <b>cargoes</b> may be accepted or rejected. A ship may carry only one cargo at a time. The objective is to maximise the revenue of <b>optional</b> <b>cargoes</b> minus cargo handling and fuel cost. The review of these research papers is reported in the follows items. The first is that their research model is most useful for bulk carriers since it assumes only one cargo to be loaded at a time. The second is that the problem known in the literature as the ‘fixed-charge problem’ is not addressed. In this problem, fixed charges; such as port dues, are to be paid {{no matter how many}} cargoes ship selects in each port. The third is that the objective does not consider the time taken to earn revenues. In tramp shipping, revenue or gross profit per day is a common objective.|$|R

5000|$|BIG TRAK / bigtrak is a {{programmable}} {{electric vehicle}} created by Milton Bradley in 1979, resembling a futuristic Sci-Fi tank / utility vehicle, possibly {{for use on}} the Moon or a Planetoid style environment. The original Big Trak was a six-wheeled (two-wheel drive) tank with a front-mounted blue [...] "photon beam" [...] headlamp, and a keypad on top. The toy could remember up to 16 commands, which it then executed in sequence. There also was an <b>optional</b> <b>cargo</b> trailer accessory, with the U.K. version being white to match its colour scheme; once hooked to the Bigtrak, this trailer could be programmed to dump its payload.|$|E
5000|$|The SW1 steam Wagon {{is another}} {{variation}} of the SR/TE engines in the range and was first produced in 1972. The model is largely attributed to Steve Malins, grandson of the founder of Malins Engineers. Apparently Steve took his inspiration from a book entitled 'The overtype steam road waggon' (Published in 1971 and written by Maurice A Kelly). The SW1 basically uses a mixture of components from the SR1a roller and TE1a traction engines to which is attached a lorry-style rear body with a cab and payload bed. The extra length of body is supported on a C section girder 'chassis'. The engine has a double reduced drive using a large intermediate pulley, similar to the flywheel. This gives a more realistic speed as well as affording the model more pulling power. A live rear axle (only one wheel is driven) has distinctive diamond-spoked wheels (closely based on a Foden design. The wagon is {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Foden Wagon'). The model has red wheels and a blue, green or brown body, with a white quarter-length canopy over the engine and boiler. The model has details such as mudguards and an <b>optional</b> <b>cargo</b> of 'barrels'. More recently limited edition models have been made in a darker shade of green as well as black. Other variations to the SW1 include a blue version of the model with white lettering on the rear payload body, as opposed to the standard gold lettering. An alternative colour scheme is carried by the SW1B model. Here, the model has deep brown bodywork and cream wheels. Recently a limited edition version was produced for Forest Classics using an all black colour scheme. 100 were produced. The steam wagon is still in production today (2012) and is still regarded by many as the company's finest mobile.|$|E

40|$|Operations {{research}} has proven {{itself to be}} advantageous in several areas of the industry for many years, but is operations research a good approach to operational maritime planning? Expressions {{used to calculate the}} initial stability of a vessel are often non-linear. Optimisation models demand linearity, and approximated linearisations of the proven stability formulas needed to be developed. This was arguably found to be the biggest challenge when modelling the cargo stowage optimisation model. The characteristics of the RoRo shipping industry have been examined to gain a better understand of the segment. Further, some methods for calculating the initial stability of floating bodies have been presented for the readers that are not already familiar with this area of science. The thesis has used a published optimisation model as a foundation for further expansions. The model is a mathematical formulation of a cargo stowage problem in the RoRo shipping segment, where a predetermined vessel ships mandatory and <b>optional</b> <b>cargoes</b> from fixed loading ports to unloading ports. The reference model controls the vertical and transverse stability of the vessel by imposing constraints that are linear approximations of stability formulas. The model was expanded to ensure the longitudinal stability of the vessel as well. Additionally, the definitions of the existing vertical and transverse stability constraints were altered to provide more accurate co-ordinates for the expanded optimisation model. The computational study showed that the original model was able to find the optimal solution faster than the expanded model. The stowage flexibility was also better than for the expanded model, and the revenue generated was equal or higher in the original model for all scenarios. This was because the expanded model is of a greater size than the original, and is much more constrained in terms of stowage on the various decks. The expanded model divides the decks on the vessel not only into lanes, as the original model does, but also into slots. It can therefore ensure the longitudinal stability of the vessel as well. In addition to this, the lanes and slots in the expanded model are subject to lower and upper bounds for width and length, respectively. The original model allows the width of a lane to take values from zero up to the total width of the deck. In the original model, the size of the set of lanes therefore does not dictate the division of decks into lanes. This was found good for stowage flexibility, but is problematic to defend from a stability and safety perspective. </p...|$|R

The T1020, or more accurately the PA-31-350T1020 was a PA-31-350 Chieftain optimized for and marketed for the commuter airline market. It featured reduced fuel capacity compared to the standard Chieftain, with the [...] auxiliary fuel tanks in each wing of the Chieftain not fitted to the T1020. It also had reduced baggage capacity ( [...] maximum instead of the Chieftain's [...] maximum) and up to eleven seats. The first T1020 was delivered in December 1981. The second aircraft in the T1000 stable was the T1040 – the PA-31T3 model. The T1040 was a hybrid, featuring the main fuselage of the PA-31-350T1020 with the nose and tail of the PA-31T1 Cheyenne I. The wings were similar to the Cheyenne I's, but with reduced fuel capacity and baggage lockers in the engine nacelles {{similar to those of}} the Chieftain. An <b>optional</b> underbelly <b>cargo</b> pod was also available. The Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-11 turboprop engines were the same as those of the Cheyenne I. Deliveries of the T1040 began in July 1982.

40|$|Ship routing and {{scheduling}} {{is among the}} most important task for many shipping companies. Today, only few shipping companies use optimization-based decision support systems for routing {{and scheduling}} of their fleet. They still accomplish this task manually based on their experience. However, access to an optimization-based decision support system may be of great value for planners in shipping companies. By proper routing and scheduling of their fleets of ships the shipping companies may get the possibility to increase the income by transporting more <b>optional</b> spot <b>cargoes</b> and/or to reduce the sailing costs. This may have an important financial impact for the shipping companies in an increasingly competitive market. This thesis presents various short-term ship routing and scheduling problems faced by planners in tramp shipping companies, and proposes solution methods for solving them. The focus is on local search-based heuristic solution methods that can find good solutions to the problems within reasonable time, and hence give valuable decision support for the planners. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part gives an introduction to ship routing and scheduling problems. The second part consists of four papers that are the major contribution of this thesis. The first paper focuses on decision support for planner in shipping companies. In the second paper an efficient tabu search heuristic is described for solving the tramp ship routing and scheduling problem. Flexible cargo quantities are considered in paper 3, while split loads are introduced and discussed in paper 4. The papers have been submitted to international journals, three have been accepted for publication while one is still in the refereeing process. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|R
