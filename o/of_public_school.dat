40|$|M. Tech. (Construction Management) Focusing on the {{dilapidated}} state <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> {{infrastructure in}} the Gauteng Province of South Africa, this study presents {{findings on the}} current state <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure, why <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure is in a dilapidated state, various factors which contribute to the dilapidated state <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure, an overview of measures which have been undertaken to improve the state <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure and subsequently proposes a multi stakeholder framework for the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure. To achieve {{the objectives of the}} study, a detailed literature review of Botswana, Nigeria, United States of America and South Africa were compiled on <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure. A set of multiple questionnaires were designed to collect data from 34 <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> in Gauteng Province of South Africa. The field survey comprised of Department of Education Officials, maintenance contractors, school governing body members, school Teachers, school principals and community members. There are multiple factors which when they occur lead to the dilapidation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure. The primary factors include that maintenance works are undertaken in a disjointed manner with no clear strategy, inadequate government intervention, no sense of ownership for the schools by learners, teachers, parents and community members, inadequate funds allocated to schools, vandalism, lack of maintenance, funds not allocated based on individual school needs, neglect, deferred maintenance and overcrowding. The study is restricted to the Gauteng Province of South Africa. The selection of Gauteng as a case study has been mainly influenced by accessibility to the researcher and its high rate of overcrowding in schools which is also accompanied by high <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure backlog. The findings of the research will be taken as representative for the entire country. The study provides a detailed comprehension on the various factors which contribute to the dilapidated state <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure and further proposes a multi stakeholder framework for the proper maintenance <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure. The study provides an understanding of the various factors so as to enhance maintenance <b>of</b> existing <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> infrastructure and the capability of the government to build new schools or extend the existing schools to meet the demand...|$|R

25|$|In 1962, {{the town}} of Derry {{negotiated}} a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities (Chester, Hampstead, Auburn, Londonderry and Windham) signed service contracts with the academy. In response to the increased number <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing needs and interests of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established Londonderry High School. Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are {{in the best position to}} argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

25|$|The {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> {{buildings}} in the Los Angeles area displayed mixed responses to the shaking, and those that were built after {{the enforcement of the}} Field Act clearly showed the results of the reformed construction styles. The Field Act was put into effect just one month following the destructive March 1933 Long Beach earthquake that damaged many public school buildings in Long Beach, Compton, and Whittier. The Los Angeles Unified School District had 660 schools consisting of 9,200 buildings {{at the time of the}} earthquake, with 110 masonry buildings that had not been reinforced to meet the new standards. More than 400 portable classrooms and 53 wood frame pre-Field Act buildings were also in use. All these buildings had been previously inspected with regard to the requirements of the Act, and many were reinforced or rebuilt at that time, but earthquake engineering experts recommended further immediate refurbishment or demolition after a separate evaluation was done after the February 1971 earthquake, and within a year and a half the district followed through with the direction with regard to about 100 structures.|$|E
25|$|Following Lowell's earlier {{reform of}} Harvard's admissions process to {{increase}} the admission <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>school</b> students, the Jewish proportion {{of the student body}} rose from 6% in 1908 to 22% in 1922, at a time when Jews constituted about 3% of the U.S. population. Lowell, continuing to focus on the cohesiveness of the student body, described a campus where antisemitism was growing and Jewish students were ever more likely to be isolated from the majority. He feared—and recent developments at Columbia University supported him—that the social elite would cease sending its sons to Harvard as Jewish enrollment increased. He cited what he saw as the parallel experience of hotels and clubs that lost their old membership when the proportion of Jewish members increased. He proposed limiting Jewish admissions to 15% of the entering class. His attempts to persuade members of the Harvard Board of Overseers to adopt his views were already failing when the plan was leaked to the Boston Post in May 1922. The idea was immediately denounced by Irish and black groups and by the American Federation of Labor.|$|E
