As such, it rests on the idea that systematic theology must take account of the fact of religious pluralism within its articulation of the Christian faith. It might be asked however, despite clear motivations such as the traditional imperative of mission, why we need a theology of religions at all. Why not simply dialogue or engage in a kind of comparative study of the texts and practices of the religions? On the contrary, the fact of religious pluralism requires at least a basic or schematic response in the present, and not only in the alwayspostponed-future that makes true dialogue and comparative theology possible and fruitful.

40|$|Abstract. Before one {{can even}} begin to model {{consciousness}} and what exactly it means {{that it is a}} subjective phenomenon one needs a theory about what a first-person perspective really is. This theory has to be conceptually convincing, empirically plausible and, most of all, <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>developments.</b> The chosen conceptual framework must be able to accommodate scientific progress. Its ba-sic assumptions have to be plastic as it were, so that new details and empirical data can continuously be fed into the theoretical model as it grows and becomes more refined. This paper makes an attempt at sketching the outlines of such a theory, offering a representationalist analysis of the phenomenal first-person perspective. Three phenomenal target properties are centrally relevant: “mine-ness ” (phenomenal appropriation; the sense of ownership), “selfhood ” (the con-scious experience of being someone), and “perspectivalness ” (a structural fea-ture: phenomenal space as a whole is organized around a center, a supramodal point of view).

40|$|Proceedings of: 4 th International Conference on Powder Metallurgy (RoPM 2009). Since low alloyed {{sintered}} steels {{were introduced}} in the market of the structural parts, we have followed {{the evolution of a}} material with poor mechanical properties and any uniformity (in the sense of reproducibility) to materials that today are produced with high reliability and performance. The working efficiency could be equivalent in many cases with the best wrought steel, and maintaining a good margin in terms of cost and competitively. In this paper a complete review of the topic is accomplished, from the early times when the first parts were made by plain iron or iron-carbon, going through the different alloying systems: Fe-Cu, Fe-P, Fe-Cu-Ni-Mo, and more recently Fe-Cr-Mo and Fe-Mn. The development in processing routes has been considered too. The main milestones in the field of new alloying systems have been: 1) the introduction of Cu in 60 - 70 &# 8223;s, 2) the new complex systems with Cu-Ni-Mo in the 80 &# 8223;s and 3) the introduction of alloying elements with high oxygen affinity (in the late 90 &# 8223;s). Regarding the milestones in processing could be considered: 1) the development of new mixing procedures, 2) the warm compaction and high velocity compaction, 3) the improvements in sintering control and high temperature sintering. Several decades of research and innovation, acting on the processing system (mixing, pressing, sintering, post-sintering operations, [...] .) and on the alloying system (from the earliest times with plain iron to complex systems used today), has allowed us to have a highly competitive materials, in terms of performance, and processes in terms of cost.

For this reason we have created and developed a collaborative system: ActivCollector ([URL] useful and available to researchers in human nutrition. This system is not only a technological but also a research tool because it integrates the intelligence necessary to the modelling of metabolic process such as energy expenditure, for example. This system is composed of a server, data bases and software (figure). Its architecture has been initially conceived <b>to</b> be <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> and <b>new</b> users. At the present, ActivCollector contains several units necessary to : • Project and user management. These two first units allow managing of the research projects in nutrition independently from/to each other. The user management enables to give access rights according to individual needs/functions. • Clinical data management. Data of several sources were considered: responses to questionnaires, data acquired from monitors or e-devices (Actiheart, Armband, smartphone), data from biological, biochemical and physical analyses. Today researchers can create their own questionnaires or use the existing questionnaires in the data basis. They can also send them to volunteers by internet and schedule the automatic mathematical treatments of responses given by volunteers. We are working to the collect and treatment of data acquired by smartphone to estimate energy expenditure in free- living conditions. • Communication between volunteers and researchers by the access of the internet (internal e-mail). To our knowledge ActivCollector is the first system of clinical data centralization and modelling of metabolic process available for the researchers in nutrition.

Methods: After discussing the logical pathway used in criteria selection, the paper presents the new classification and compares {{it with the}} classification currently in use, that is, the one issued by the European Glaucoma Society in 2008. Results: The paper proves that the new classification is clear (being based on a coherent and consistently followed set of criteria), is comprehensive (framing all forms of glaucoma), and helps in understanding the sickness understanding (in that it uses a logical framing system). The great advantage is that it facilitates therapeutic decision making in that it offers direct therapeutic suggestions and avoids errors leading to disasters. Moreover, the scheme remains <b>open</b> <b>to</b> any <b>new</b> <b>development.</b> Conclusion: The suggested classification is a pathogenic, etiologic, and clinical classification that fulfills the conditions of an ideal classification. The suggested classification is the first classification in which the main criterion is consistently used for the first 5 to 7 crossings until its differentiation capabilities are exhausted. Then, secondary criteria (etiologic and clinical) pick up the relay until each form finds its logical place in the scheme. In order to avoid unclear aspects, the genetic criterion is no longer used, being replaced by age, one of the clinical criteria. The suggested classification brings only benefits to all categories of ophthalmologists: the beginners will have a tool {{to better understand the}} sickness and to ease their decision making, whereas the experienced doctors will have their practice simplified. For all doctors, errors leading to therapeutic disasters will be less likely to happen. Finally, researchers will have the object of their work gathered in the group of glaucoma with unknown or uncertain pathogenesis, whereas the results of their work will easily find a logical place in the scheme, as the suggested classification remains <b>open</b> <b>to</b> any <b>new</b> <b>development.</b> Keywords: glaucoma, classification of glaucoma, pathogenic forms of glaucom...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The 18 th century {{is a period}} <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> and {{advances}} in Ottoman poetry and miniature art. Due to failures in political life, the state turned to the West and encountered a “New World,” thereby {{paving the way for}} a renewal in art. The principal reason for this longing for novelty (especially in the Tulip Period) is a desire to experience worldly pleasures. In this context, the poet Nedim and the miniaturist Levnî, who produced their works {{in the first half of}} the century, are the most important representatives of changes occurring within their respective fields of art. The increasing visibility of private life, as it was expressed in the structure of society’s elite, significantly influenced poetry and miniature art. Private life comes to life, so to speak, visually within miniatures and verbally in poems, and it leads to the appearance of realism and individualism, themes common to both Levnî and Nedim. Whereas Levnî creates his individualism by painting detailed figures taken from real life, Nedim establishes his style by expressing his experiences as he saw and lived them without embellishment, which is what made him different from other Divan poets. In addition to these characteristics, it is important to note, from the perspective of realism, that figures of beloved in both artists were selected from real life. Furthermore, elements such as eyebrows, hair, nose, mouth, lips, which Nedim highlights while speaking of his beloved in his gazels, find life in Levnî’s miniatures. The purpose of this study is to determine characteristics common to both artists, while examining the contributions each artist made to his respective field. Bulut, HülyaM. S...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{monolithic}} circuit {{has been}} designed for ac-tive-quenching and active-reset of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), which operate above the breakdown voltage BD for detecting single photons. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first fully integrated circuit of this kind ever reported. It can operate with any available SPAD device, since it generates pulses high enough to quench detectors biased up to 20 V above BD. The deadtime after each photon detection is adjustable; the minimum value is 50 ns, corresponding to 20 Mcounts/s maximum saturated photon-counting rate. The power dissipation is low (20 -mW standby), suitable also for portable instruments. The small size and high reliability of the circuit make it possible to develop miniaturized detector modules and SPAD-array detector instruments. The circuit <b>opens</b> the path <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> in many applications of photon counting, from DNA sequencing to ultrahigh-sensitivity imaging.

The SeineRiver, from the Paris urban area to the entrance of its estuary (220 km), is studied here as an example ofa large human-impacted river system subject to temperate climatic conditions. We assess organic C (OC) budgets upstream and downstream from one of the world’s largest wastewater treatment plants and fordifferent hydrological conditions using a hydrobiogeochemical model. The fine representation of sedimentaccumulation on the river bed allows for the quantification of pelagic and benthic effects on OC export toward the estuary and on river metabolism (i. e., net CO 2 production). OC export is significantly affected by benthic dynamics during the driest periods, when 25 % of the inputs to the system is transformed or stored in the sediment layer. Benthic processes also substantially affect river metabolism under any hydrological condition. On average, benthic respiration accounts for one third of the total river respiration along the studied stretch (0. 27 out of 0. 86 g C m− 2 d− 1). Even though the importance of benthic processes was already acknowledged by the scientific community for headwater streams, these results stress the major influence of benthic dynamics, and thus of physical processes such as sedimentation and resuspension, on C cycling in downstream river systems.

40|$|This thesis blends {{ecological}} {{processes and}} industrial organization assumptions to model {{specific aspects of}} industry evolution. It focuses specifically on the role that both consumer heterogeneity and its spatial distribution play in shaping market structures. We use a computational (agent-based) modelling approach to study evolutionary industry dynamics. This work develops a framework within which ecological processes take place among firms that reveal profit-seeking behaviour. The computational models consider both exogenously and endogenously defined consumer distributions. The results not only show that the replication of ecological market-level regularities from individual-level behaviour and interaction is possible. They also reflect that the ecological theory of market processes would be complemented if additional aspects were taken into account. Findings reveal both demographic effects (size and firm type) on hazard rates, as well as ecological implications of different consumer distribution shapes. It is shown how specific firm type founding processes and different consumer mobility mechanisms influence the so-called market-partitioning process. Consumer heterogeneity is also explored by studying the effects of changing market dimensionality of the product space. Results indicate that large firms take advantage of product differentiation and price discrimination as dimensionality increases. These advantages are offset by the increasing costs of niche coverage (scope disadvantages) and by market crowding, making the small firms better performers. The cross-fertilization of organizational ecology and industrial organization not only represents a better-integrated framework to study industry evolution, but also <b>opens</b> the door <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> in computational social science. ...|$|R

Some of the major emerging economies have been able to create a supportive business environment that fosters innovation, and China {{is a good example of}} a country that has been able to increase value-added investments. Conversely, when we look at Russia, another big emerging market, we witness a situation in which domestic firms struggle more with global competitiveness. Innovation has proven to be one of the most essential ingredients for firms aiming to grow and become more competitive. In emerging markets, the business environment sets many constraints for innovation. However, open strategic choices in <b>new</b> product <b>development</b> enable companies in emerging markets to expand their resource base and capability building. Networking and close inter-firm cooperation are essential in this regard. In this dissertation, I argue that technology transfer is one of the key tools for these companies to become internationally networked and to improve their competitiveness. It forces companies to reach outside the company and national borders, which in many cases, is a major challenge for firms in emerging markets. This dissertation focuses on how companies can catch up with competitiveness in emerging markets.

40|$|Communication plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in shaping}} our understanding of complex issues such as climate change. Too often scientists and journalists complain that the public does not fully comprehend climate change as they cannot see it. Adhering to calls for a need to propel away from media representations of climate change to a focus on more case-specific research, this Master Thesis analyses the aspect of visualisation within climate change communication with a focus on a contemporary example, the Extreme Ice Survey (EIS), as a case-specific study. EIS give a visual voice to our planets changing eco-systems, where an emphasis is placed on visually documenting the adverse effects climate change has on the planets glaciers, through conventional photography and time-lapse photography. Adhering to the need for further studies of visual representations towards the environment this thesis deploys an image analysis to investigate how meaning is framed through the EIS’s photographs and time-lapse videos. A collective reading between the photographs and their accompanying written captions highlighted contradictive frames of beauty and uncertainty. Additionally, as climate change is predominately seen as an abstract entity, a metaphor analysis was also applied <b>to</b> <b>open</b> further frames of thought into more comprehensible understandings.

40|$|The Science 2. 0 -Survey {{investigates the}} {{dissemination}} {{and use of}} online tools and social media applications among scientists of all disciplines at German universities (institutions of higher education) and research institutions (Leibniz, Helmholtz, Max Planck institutes). Results show that digital, online-based tools have found widespread use and acceptance in academia and must therefore be considered a central component of scientific working processes. Furthermore the data gathered also {{make it clear that}} certain usage patterns begin to emerge and stabilise as routines in everyday academic work. The most popular tools are the online encyclopedia Wikipedia (95 % of all respondents use it professionally), mailing lists (78 %), online archives/databases (75 %) and content sharing/cloud services such as Dropbox or Slideshare (70 %). Meanwhile, social bookmarking services remain largely untapped and unknown among scientists (only 5 % professional usage). Online tools and social media applications are most commonly utilised in a research context. In addition to Wikipedia (67 %), the top three tools used for research purposes are online archives/databases (63 %), reference management software (49 %) and content sharing/cloud services (43 %). In teaching, learning management systems (32 %) play a significant role, even though this mainly applies to universities. Video/photo communities (25 %), online archives/databases (23 %) and content sharing/cloud services (21 %) are also used by scientists in the context of teaching. However, {{there seems to be some}} backlog in the fi eld of science communication. Scientists are rarely active in this area; 45 per cent of respondents say science communication is not part of their range of duties, while for another 40 per cent such activities comprise no more than 10 per cent of their daily workload. When active in the fi eld of science communication, scientists seem to favour classic online-based tools such as mailing lists (44 %) or videoconferences/VoIP (35 %), while typical Web 2. 0 tools such as weblogs (10 %) or microblogs (6 %) are rarely used in this context. Social network sites (SNS) with a professional and/or academic orientation (30 %), however, are relatively common for communication purposes in academia. The situation is similar for science administration practices where, although the use of online-based tools and social media applications is more common, no more than one-quarter of the scientists use a particular tool, while personal organizers/schedule managers (27 %) dominate. The main factors cited by scientists as preventing them from using online-based tools and social media applications professionally are a lack of added value for their own work (30 %), insufficient technical assistance (21 %) and insufficient time to become familiar with the handling of the tools (15 %). In particular, many scientists do not use microblogs (53 %), discussion forums (41 %) and weblogs (40 %) professionally because they cannot see any added value in using them. With regard to the attitudes of scientists in relation to the use of online tools and social media applications, results show that they are aware of privacy issues and have relatively high concerns about the spread of and access to personal data on the Internet. However, scientists generally have few reservations about dealing with social media and show themselves <b>to</b> be <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> technological <b>developments.</b> This report documents the results of a Germany-wide online survey of a total of 2, 084 scientists at German universities (1, 419) and research institutions (665). The survey explores the usage of 18 online tools and social media applications for daily work in research, teaching, science administration and science communication. In addition to the frequency and context of use, the survey also documents reasons for the non-use of tools, as well as general attitudes towards the Internet and social media.
