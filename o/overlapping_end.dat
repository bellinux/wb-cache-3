40|$|We have {{employed}} numerical approaches to study earthquake nucleation on geometrically complex faults governed by either slip-dependent friction or rate- and state- dependent friction. The interactions of fault friction, complex fault geometry and remote slow stressing from plate tectonics are investigated. In particular, {{we focus on}} characterizing three important physical aspects of an earthquake: the occurrence time, hypocenter location and earthquake source dimensions. Using a slip dependent friction law, we have investigated earthquake nucleation on both thrust and normal dip-slip faults with changes in dip (bends) at depth. Our results show that earthquakes tend to nucleate at shallower depth on thrust faults as compared to those on normal faults with the same geometry. Nucleation time increases significantly as the fault plane are bent more severe for both thrust and normal faults. Using the rate- and state-dependent friction, we studied nucleation on two parallel planar faults with step-over features. We focus on investigating how nucleation {{is affected by the}} offset between the two faults. We found that for faults with compressional step-overs, earthquakes tend to nucleate the end of the overlapping zone when the offset is small, but generally nucleate further away from the <b>overlapping</b> <b>end</b> as the offset becomes larger. For faults with extensional step-overs, nucleation always occurs near the <b>overlapping</b> <b>end</b> for all the offsets considered. Our studies provide better understanding of the effects of fault geometry on earthquake nucleation and form a basis for the study of nucleation on large scale geometrically complex fault systems such as fault systems in Southern California. Our results may also provide realistic earthquake source conditions for rupture dynamics studies which at present largely employ ad hoc source conditions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{causal link}} between {{disparate}} tropomyosin (Tm) functions and the structural instability in Tm is unknown. To test {{the hypothesis that}} the structural instability in the central region of Tm modulates the function of the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of contiguous Tm dimers, we used transgenic mice (TmDM) that expressed a mutant α-Tm in the heart; S 229 E and H 276 N substitutions induce structural instability in the central region and the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of Tm, respectively. In addition, two mouse cardiac troponin T mutants (TnT 1 – 44 Δ and TnT 45 – 74 Δ) that have a divergent effect on the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of Tm were employed. The S 229 E-induced instability in the central region of TmDM altered the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of TmDM, thereby it negated the attenuating effect of H 276 N on Ca 2 +-activated maximal tension. The rate of cross-bridge detachment (g) decreased in TmDM+TnTWT and TmH 276 N+TnTWT fibers but increased in TmDM+TnT 45 – 74 Δ fibers; however, TnT 45 – 74 Δ did not alter g, demonstrating that S 229 E in TmDM had divergent effects on g. The S 229 E substitution in TmDM ablated the H 276 N-induced desensitization of myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity in TmDM+TnT 1 – 44 Δ fibers. To our knowledge, novel findings from this study show that the structural instability in the central region of Tm modifies cardiac contractile function via its effect on the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of contiguous Tm...|$|R

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 6 recent outcome {{trials of}} blood pressure (BP) -lowering drugs in 74, 524 randomized hypertensive or high-risk patients. Over interpretation of nonsignificant or marginal probability values in large trials with <b>overlapping</b> <b>end</b> points, exclusion of patients not tolerating or not adhering to experimental treatments, labeling nonsignificant treatment effects as modest, and insufficient {{information on the}} quality of the BP measurements or on the BP changes early after randomization raise concern. From a clinical viewpoint, results should not be extrapolated to patients with characteristics dissimilar from those randomized. The benefit beyond BP lowering in cardiovascular prevention is tiny. Dual inhibition of the renin system should only be used in patients at high risk, in whom all drug combinations have been tried and who cannot be controlled by a single renin system inhibitor. Current evidence does not support BP lowering in normotensive patients or the use of renin system inhibitors for prevention of stroke recurrence. Because angiotensin-receptor blockers might offer less protection against myocardial infarction than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the latter should remain the preferred renin system inhibitor for cardiovascular prevention in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-tolerant patients. In 2 trials, in which new-onset diabetes was a predefined end point, 1000 patients had to be treated for 1 year with an angiotensin-receptor blocker instead of placebo to prevent just 2 cases. From a design viewpoint, the time has come to revise the concept of large simple trials and to pursue research questions that serve patient interests more than showing noninferiority or highlight the ancillary qualities of marketable antihypertensive drugs. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|As {{more easily}} mined {{deposits}} are depleted, the reserves {{are becoming more}} limited and less favorable. Deposits of coal or trona that are being longwall mined are deep and are getting deeper. Coal bursts and bumps frequently occur within development entries in longwall mining of deep mines due to high stresses. This paper presents a novel patented longwall mining layout “Longwall Mining with Split-level Gate roads (LMSG) ” {{that has the potential}} to mitigate several problems related to deep mining (Patent No. ZL 98100544. 6). LMSG locates gate roads on either end of a longwall panel at different vertical heights within a coal seam or in a geologically split seam, so that the two adjacent panels can be partially offset horizontally. It is novel in that it incorporates unit operations of different mining methods into the system. By employing multiple slice longwall mining method locally at the face ends, and adjacent panels <b>overlapping</b> <b>end</b> to end, pillar-less longwall mining can be achieved to mine deep deposits. A conventional rectangular gate road pillar is therefore transformed into a small triangular pillar and the gate road of the subsequent panel can be located along or under the gob of the previously mined panel where the stresses are lower. Several mines in China and Russia are currently using the technology with reduced incidence of ground control problems. Through theoretical analysis, and physical and numerical modeling approaches, it is demonstrated that LMSG significantly improves stress environment for development entries, with associated reduction in coal bursts and ground control problems...|$|E
40|$|Post-transcriptional gene {{regulation}} frequently occurs through elements in mRNA 3 ′ untranslated regions (UTRs) 1, 2. Although crucial roles for 3 ′UTR-mediated {{gene regulation}} {{have been found}} in Caenorhabditis elegans 3, 4, 5, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3 ′UTRs 6, 7. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A) -position profiling by sequencing (3 P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3 ′UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs 8, 3 P-Seq identified 8, 580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that {{do not seem to be}} authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3 ′UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30 % of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially <b>overlapping</b> <b>end</b> regions that generate another 10, 480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3 ′UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3 ′UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a novel formulation and analytical solutions for adhesively bonded composite single lap joints by {{taking into account}} the transverse shear deformation and large deflection in adherends. On the basis of geometrically nonlinear analysis for infinitesimal elements of adherends and adhesive, the equilibrium equations of adherends are formulated. By using the Timoshenko beam theory, the governing differential equations are expressed in terms of the adherend displacements and then analytically solved for the force boundary conditions prescribed at both <b>overlap</b> <b>ends.</b> The obtained solutions are applied to single lap joints, whose adherends can be isotropic adherends or composite laminates with symmetrical lay-ups. A new formula for adhesive peel stress is obtained, and it can accurately predict peel stress in the bondline. The closed-form analytical solutions are then simplified for the purpose of practical applications, and a new simple expression for the edge moment factor is developed. The numerical results predicted by the present full and simplified solutions are compared with those calculated by geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis using MSC/NASTRAN. The agreement noted validates the present novel formulation and solutions for adhesively bonded composite joints. The simplified shear and peel stresses at the <b>overlap</b> <b>ends</b> are used to derive energy release rates.

40|$|Biopolymers {{serve as}} {{one-dimensional}} tracks on which motor proteins move {{to perform their}} biological roles. Motor protein phenomena have inspired theoretical models of one-dimensional transport, crowding, and jamming. Experiments studying the motion of Xklp 1 motors on reconstituted antiparallel microtubule overlaps demonstrated that motors recruited to the overlap walk toward the plus end of individual microtubules and frequently switch between filaments. We study a model of this system that couples the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) for motor motion with switches between antiparallel filaments and binding kinetics. We determine steady-state motor density profiles for fixed-length overlaps using exact and approximate solutions of the continuum differential equations and compare to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Overlap motor density profiles and motor trajectories resemble experimental measurements. The phase diagram of the model {{is similar to the}} single-filament case for low switching rate, while for high switching rate we find a new low density-high density-low density-high density phase. The overlap center region, far from the <b>overlap</b> <b>ends,</b> has a constant motor density as one would naively expect. However, rather than following a simple binding equilibrium, the center motor density depends on total overlap length, motor speed, and motor switching rate. The size of the crowded boundary layer near the <b>overlap</b> <b>ends</b> is also dependent on the overlap length and switching rate in addition to the motor speed and bulk concentration. The antiparallel microtubule overlap geometry may offer a previously unrecognized mechanism for biological regulation of protein concentration and consequent activity...|$|R
