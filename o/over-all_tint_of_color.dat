The second terrace was a league-long flow of gray and gold daisies, in which the cattle dazedly wandered mid-leg deep. A perpetual sunshine of yellow dandelions lay upon the third. The gentle slope to the dark-green canada was a broad cataract of crimson poppies. Everywhere where water had stood, great patches <b>of</b> <b>color</b> had taken its place.

Twenty to twenty-six transverse ribs may be counted upon its surface, among which, in old specimens, are found other smaller ones which are alternately disposed between the first, towards the most elevated part. All the ribs are separated by furrows which are not throughout of the same size. The aperture is wide, large and ovate. Its lips are white, and the interior reddish. The outer lip, terminated by a scolloped dilatation, is traversed by a canal of no great depth. The inner lip is white, thin, applied to the body of the body whorl and forms a part of the umbilicus. The columella is twisted spirally. The <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> the exterior is whitish, varied with red, and covered, upon the transverse ribs, with irregular spots which sometimes form longitudinal or zigzag bands <b>of</b> a deeper <b>color.</b> Upon some specimens are observed ribs which have no other <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> <b>coloring</b> than the ground of the shell.

6000|$|... "Next to appropriateness, {{the second}} {{requisite}} to beauty in dress I {{take to be}} unity of effect. In speaking of the arrangement of rooms in the 'House and Home Papers,' I criticised some apartments wherein were many showy articles of furniture, and much expense had been incurred, because, with all this, there was no unity of result. The carpet was costly, and in itself handsome; the paper was also in itself handsome and costly; the tables and chairs also in themselves very elegant; and yet, owing to a want of any unity of idea, any grand harmonizing <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> or method <b>of</b> arrangement, the rooms had a jumbled, confused air, and nothing about them seemed particularly pretty or effective. I instanced rooms where thousands of dollars had been spent, which, because of this defect, never excited admiration; and others in which the furniture was of the cheapest description, but which always gave immediate and universal pleasure. The same rule holds good in dress. As in every apartment, so in every toilet, there should be one ground-tone or dominant color, which should rule all the others, {{and there should be}} a general style of idea to which everything should be subjected.|$|R

The more you practice this, when the subject evidently calls for it, the more your eye will enjoy the higher qualities <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> The process is, in fact, the carrying out of the principle <b>of</b> separate <b>colors</b> to the utmost possible refinement; using atoms <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in juxtaposition, instead of large spaces. And note, in filling up minute interstices of this kind, {{that if you want}} the color you fill them with to show brightly, it is better to put a rather positive point of it, with a little white left beside or round it in the interstice, than to put a pale <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> the <b>color</b> over the whole interstice.

40|$|The {{exploration}} {{during my}} Master of Arts degree program {{evolved from a}} fascination of the surface qualities created by the printmaking process of photo-etching. The process begins by recording the selected image with a camera. The resulting negative is enlarged onto a piece of litho film which creates a large negative of strictly opaque and clear areas with no intermediary grays. Through the intense light of the carbon arc lamp the image is transferred from the litho film to a light sensitive zinc plate for printing. The plate is commercially etched {{in order to achieve}} a uniform depth which will result in a clearer and deeper embossing when run through the printing press. After the pieces are embossed a slight <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> is applied by hand to give greater definition and to enhance the image. The color adds to the effect of illusion along with the interaction of light and shadows created by the depth of the embossing. Through photo-etching I am able not only to manipulate the image photographed but also to mold the product produced by the initial photographic effort. The work becomes a tactile object with depth and dimension contributing to an illusionistic effect; it now has shape and definite surface qualities which accomplishes far more than the traditional flat photograph of a recorded event. Printmaking has expanded my photographic range but an important factor of my work is that my starting image is still always photographic and that this image must have strength in itself. It must be able to withstand the change in medium and still retain its integrity. Photo-etching allows me to achieve another level of imagery beyond the limits of conventional photography and to produce work with its own unique characteristics. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this paper}} was devoted to {{investigating}} some nanosized iron oxide pigments prepared by microemulsion technique. The role of concentration of iron salt and surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) on the produced iron oxide was studied. The techniques employed to characterize the samples were thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscope, infrared spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results revealed that the particle size of the prepared sample using 0. 2 [*]M iron sulfate and 3. 2 [*]wt% of surfactant was in the range 7 – 9 [*]nm. Increasing the concentration of either iron salt or the surfactant increased the particle size of the obtained ferric oxide. The diffuse reflectance measurements showed that the charge transfer/electron pair transition absorption peak, which {{is closely related to}} the reddish <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the oxide, was shifted to a longer wavelength (blue shift) by decreasing the dimension of the particles.

Her pigmentation is also no longer green but a light <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> the <b>color,</b> giving her a more human appearance. Originally, as seen in Harley Quinn's story mission, she was first imprisoned at the Blüdhaven police station, but was soon rescued by Harley Quinn who fought the entire police department, as well as Nightwing. Poison Ivy attended Scarecrow's meeting with the other villains, but refused to join in. As a result, Scarecrow had her knocked out and placed in gas chamber to have the new Fear Toxin used on her. However, Batman knocks out the guards and Poison Ivy proves immune to the toxin, allowing Batman {{to take her to}} the Isolation Cell at the GCPD. Batman is forced to work together with her in order to stop Scarecrow's citywide fear toxin by helping her awaken two ancient trees that had long since gone dormant. She helps save the city, but sacrifices her life in the process. She dies and disintegrates in Batman's arms after her final act of redemption.

50|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 1970s, while {{simultaneously}} painting works that have evolved from the iconic abstractions of Paris, Rappaport makes over twenty portraits in grattage beginning with the double portrait of Jake and Esther Schwartz (1971) in Philadelphia while staying at his brother's on his return from France {{in the summer of}} 1971 for the sculptor Barbara Schwartz, the model for Potiphar's Wife in Joseph Accused; then once in New York, Luke (1973) that will be shown along with works by Warhol and Philip Pearlstein in New York City / Carnegie Mellon Alumni exhibition at Westbroadway Gallery in 1976, the tapestry-like devotional icon of the guru Baba Muktananda (1976-1977), and its technical twin: The White Sisters (1976-1979), that evolves through several metamorphosis, then finally scraped-down to a bare <b>tint</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> on the canvas threads leaving only the lyrical contours as an Art Nouveau tableau, finished just months before the artist's return to traditional brush painting with The Barren Womb (1979).But before his New York period begins, the artist is stricken and operated for pericarditis in the spring of 1972, spending most of the summer at his brother's in Philadelphia convalescing before needing a second operation in early September. Then two theatre friends of his brother's from the Carnegie Tech Drama Department invite the artist to New York by commissioning their portraits in grattage. The first, the double portrait of Jack & Richard (1972) of the stage designer Jack Doepp and aspiring opera singer Richard Magpion is made during the artist's stay at Jack's studio on West 85th Street {{for the remainder of the}} year and owes the decorative aspect and theatrical staging of the two figures emerging from the densely luminous red surface to Gustav Klimt's gilded paintings. The portrait, nonetheless, is declined and five years later in 1977 is purchased by Pamela Newhouse. The second, the more sober portrait of Dean Brown (1973), is finished that spring when the artist moves to East Seventh Street in the East Village, Manhattan. In 1974, at the home of Conde Nast publisher S.I. Newhouse Jr., Rappaport is introduced to Joseph Papp, the founding director of the New York Public Theatre, who offers to hang the nine feet high Joseph in the Pit and Jacob in Mourning in the Public Theatre's inner-lobby. They are installed that autumn of 1974 and remain there till the autumn of 1977.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his impressions from antique gems, Tassie executed many large profile medallion portraits of his contemporaries, and these form the most original and definitely artistic class of his works. They were modelled in wax from the life or from drawings done from the life, and when this was impossible from other authentic sources.
