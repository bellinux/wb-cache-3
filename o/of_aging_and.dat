5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

25|$|In rodents, caloric {{restriction}} slows aging and extends lifespan. At least 4 {{studies have shown}} that {{caloric restriction}} reduces 8-OHdG damages in various organs of rodents. One of these studies showed that caloric restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and in mouse brain, heart, kidney and liver. More recently, Wolf et al. showed that dietary restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Thus reduction of oxidative DNA damage is associated with a slower rate <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> increased lifespan.|$|E
25|$|According to Paul Baltes, the {{benefits}} granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age.

If {{it were a}} disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds {{this may have been}} a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> as {{the benefits}} of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.|$|E
25|$|In particular, {{associative}} learning, {{which is}} another type of episodic memory, is vulnerable to the effects <b>of</b> <b>aging,</b> <b>and</b> this has been demonstrated across various study paradigms. This has been explained by the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (ADH), which states that aging {{is associated with a}} deficiency in creating and retrieving links between single units of information. This can include knowledge about context, events or items. The ability to bind pieces of information together with their episodic context in a coherent whole has been reduced in the elderly population. Furthermore, the older adults’ performances in free recall involved temporal contiguity to a lesser extent than for younger people, indicating that associations regarding contiguity become weaker with age.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} free {{radicals}} are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> even demonstrated that free radical reactions {{contribute to the}} degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as we age, including diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E

40|$|This hermeneutical study interprets and {{describes}} the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> living with disability.

The study is grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer and framed in the context of embodiment, masculinity, and narrative. I conducted multiple in-depth interviews with older men aged from 67 to 83 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Seven <b>of</b> the participants had experienced a stroke and I was able to explore the phenomenon of disability with them. Through thematic and narrative analyses of the textual data interpretations were developed that identified common meanings and understandings of the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. These themes and narratives reveal that the men's understandings are at odds with conventional negative views <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. These older men are 'alive and kicking', they voice counternarratives to the dominant construction <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> as decline <b>and</b> weakness, and have succeeded in remaking the lifeworld after stroke. Overall I have come to understand an overarching meaning of older men 'working it out' as illustrative of a strong face <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability. Older men seek out opportunities to participate actively in community life and, despite the challenges <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> disability, lead significant and meaningful lives.

25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

The association between inflammation <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> is based on complex molecular and cellular changes that we are only just beginning to understand.

In the present study we examined the effect <b>of</b> normal <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> LPS-induced inflammation on astroglia-neuron interaction in the rat hippocampus <b>of</b> adult, normal <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated adult rats. Astrocytes were smaller, with thicker and shorter branches and less numerous in CA 1 Str. radiatum <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> rats in comparison to adult and LPS-treated rats. Astrocyte branches infiltrated apoptotic neurons <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats. Cellular debris, which were more numerous in CA 1 <b>of</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats, could be found apposed to astrocytes processes and were phagocytated by reactive microglia.
