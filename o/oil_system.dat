Prost made {{modifications to}} their cars <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> to improve the reliability of their engines and made minor aerodynamic changes to the front wing and the floor. The team also used an updated version of their engine the Peugeot A20 EV2 during the Friday practice sessions and reverted to the EV3 {{for the remainder of the}} weekend. BAR fitted their cars with a revised aerodynamic package which included new bargeboards and rear wings.|$|E

25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator trim tab controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Day three saw Toyota {{drop down}} {{from taking the}} fastest times to take the fifth fastest time on a {{moderately}} damp track. Felipe Massa was the fastest man on the track after 87 laps of the British circuit testing various aerodynamic and mechanical adjustments to the car. Although delayed through an <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> problem Alonso finished off aerodynamics work and continued {{to set up the}} car for the coming British Grand Prix, finishing with a time slower than second placed Williams driver Nico Rosberg. The leading GP2 driver Timo Glock took to the circuit with BMW Sauber up against ex-rival Nelson Piquet Jr. who was driving with Renault. Piquet Jr. made the fourth fastest time, more than a second faster than Glock.|$|E

25|$|The first F-100D (54–2121) flew on 24 January 1956, piloted by Daniel Darnell. It entered {{service on}} 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The {{aircraft}} suffered from reliability {{problems with the}} constant speed drive which provides constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. In fact, the drive was so unreliable that the USAF required it {{to have its own}} <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed a number of aircraft, and the refueling probes had a tendency to break away during high speed maneuvers. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between individual aircraft that, by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems. High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US $150 million. In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an X band radar transmitter to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night.|$|E

As the five red lights went out to signal the start of the race, Webber maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. Hamilton had wheelspin when he moved out of his starting position and abandoned the use of his second clutch. Vettel made a good start and passed Hamilton for second around the inside of turn one but Hamilton reclaimed the position by passing Vettel around the outside at the third corner. Schumacher also made a good start and got ahead of Button for fourth place but the McLaren driver retook the position at turn twelve after slipstreaming in Schumacher's tow on the back straight. De la Rosa ran wide at turn two allowing Buemi to pass him heading into the third turn. However, Buemi went wide allowing Hülkenberg to take advantage of Buemi's error. Buemi attempted to re-pass Hülkenberg around the inside at turn seven but Hülkenberg made contact with Buemi, puncturing the right rear tyre of Buemi's car which forced both drivers to make early pit stops. At the end of the first lap, Webber led Hamilton by 0.4 seconds, who in turn was followed by Vettel, Button, Schumacher, Rosberg, Kubica, Massa, Petrov, Sutil, Kobayashi, Alonso, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Hülkenberg, Liuzzi, Trulli, Kovalainen, Senna, Barrichello, Glock, Chandhok, di Grassi and Buemi.|$|E
