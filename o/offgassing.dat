40|$|The Quartz Melt Rate Furnace (QMRF) was {{developed}} to study the melt rate and <b>offgas</b> composition of simulated Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed. The objective of this testing was to evaluate whether the apparatus {{could be used to}} study the <b>offgas</b> chemistry of melting batches and perform small-scale slurry-fed melt rate tests. The furnace was tested in three different configurations: a dry-fed test with <b>offgas</b> analysis, a slurry-fed test without <b>offgas</b> analysis, and a slurry-fed test with <b>offgas</b> analysis. During the dry-fed test, <b>offgas</b> composition was successfully measured throughout the run and total <b>offgas</b> flow was calculated from the helium tracer concentration. During the slurry-feeding tests without <b>offgas</b> analysis, the furnace exhibited stable feeding behavior with no problems with feed tube pluggage. Feeding behavior was used to measure the melt rate of Sludge Batch 3 with Frit 320 and with Frit 418. Both frits had approximately the same melt rate during the tests based on amount of melter feed added per minute. During the slurry-fed test with <b>offgas</b> analysis, spikes in the data prevented overall <b>offgas</b> flow analysis from the helium tracer, but the ratio of different <b>offgas</b> species allowed the composition data to be compared between runs. Minor improvements were identified that would enhance the performance of the furnace and further testing should be performed to optimize the performance of the apparatus. These tests should focus on increasing the stability of <b>offgas</b> composition data by providing more surge capacity in the <b>offgas</b> system, determining the sensitivity of the furnace to melt rate during slurry-fed tests and refining the lid heat power to optimize melt rate measurements, and to develop the capability to utilize the system with radioactive feeds...|$|R
50|$|The second {{principle}} of combustion management, however, {{is to not}} use too much oxygen. The correct amount of oxygen requires three types of measurement: first, active control of air and fuel flow; second, <b>offgas</b> oxygen measurement; and third, measurement of <b>offgas</b> combustibles. For each heating process there exists an optimum condition of minimal <b>offgas</b> heat loss with acceptable levels of combustibles concentration. Minimizing excess oxygen pays an additional benefit: for a given <b>offgas</b> temperature, the NOx level is lowest when excess oxygen is kept lowest.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} three basic options for <b>offgas</b> {{treatment}} available. The volatilized contaminants in the <b>offgas</b> can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also {{be removed from the}} <b>offgas.</b>|$|R
500|$|On ascent from a dive, {{inert gas}} {{comes out of}} {{solution}} in a process called [...] "outgassing" [...] or [...] "offgassing". Under normal conditions, most <b>offgassing</b> occurs by gas exchange in the lungs. If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body. The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms, while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage. The most severe types of DCS interrupt — and ultimately damage — spinal cord function, leading to paralysis, sensory dysfunction, or death. In {{the presence of a}} right-to-left shunt of the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale, venous bubbles may enter the arterial system, resulting in an arterial gas embolism. A similar effect, known as ebullism, may occur during explosive decompression, when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the scent}} and what {{produces}} it vary somewhat in {{different kinds of}} cars. Most of the interior of an automobile consists of plastic held together {{with a number of}} adhesives and sealers. Such materials release volatile organic compounds, via outgassing or <b>offgassing.</b> These fumes are generally attributed mixtures of many different chemicals <b>offgassing</b> and to plasticizers, although their vapor pressures are very low and they are not considered volatile.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{likelihood}} that underfloor heating may add to <b>offgassing</b> and {{sick building syndrome}} in an environment, particularly when carpet {{is used as a}} flooring.|$|E
50|$|When a {{collection}} system is used, the <b>offgas</b> must be cooled to condense {{the bulk of}} the volatilized components into a liquid. The <b>offgas</b> will exit most desorbers in the 350-900 °F range. The <b>offgas</b> is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense {{the bulk of the}} volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the <b>offgas</b> is usually required. The cooled <b>offgas</b> may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the <b>offgas</b> to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} preliminary {{versions of}} the models that include {{the components of the}} <b>offgas</b> systems from the melters through the exhaust stacks and the vessel ventilation systems. The models consider only the two major chemical species in the <b>offgas</b> stream: air and steam or water vapor.

40|$|To augment {{steady-state}} design calculations, dynamic {{models of}} three <b>offgas</b> systems {{that will be}} used in the Waste Treatment Plant now under construction at the Hanford Site were developed using Aspen Custom Modeler{trademark}. The <b>offgas</b> systems modeled were those for the High Level Waste (HLW) melters, Low Activity Waste (LAW) melters and HLW Pulse Jet Ventilation (PJV) system. The models do not include <b>offgas</b> chemistry but only consider the two major species in the <b>offgas</b> stream which are air and water vapor. This is sufficient to perform material and energy balance calculations that accurately show the dynamic behavior of gas pressure, temperature, humidity and flow throughout the systems. The models are structured to perform pressure drop calculations across the various unit operations using a combination of standard engineering calculations and empirical data based correlations for specific pieces of equipment. The models include process controllers, gas ducting, control valves, exhaust fans and the <b>offgas</b> treatment equipment. The models were successfully used to analyze a large number of operating scenarios including both normal and off-normal conditions...|$|R

50|$|The oxygen window {{does not}} {{increase}} {{the rate of}} <b>offgassing</b> for a given concentration gradient of inert gas, but it {{reduces the risk of}} bubble formation and growth which depends on the total dissolved gas tension. Increased rate of <b>offgassing</b> is achieved by providing a larger gradient. The lower risk of bubble formation at a given gradient allows the increase of gradient without excessive risk of bubble formation. In other words, the larger oxygen window due to a higher oxygen partial pressure can allow the diver to decompress faster at a shallower stop at the same risk, or at the same rate at the same depth at a lower risk, or at an intermediate rate at an intermediate depth at an intermediate risk.|$|E

40|$|A zero-release <b>offgas</b> {{cleaning}} {{system for}} mixed-waste thermal treatment processes has been evaluated through experimental scoping tests and process modeling. The principles {{can possibly be}} adapted to a fluidized-bed calcination or stream reforming process, a waste melter, a rotarykiln process, and possibly other waste treatment thermal processes. The basic concept of a zero-release <b>offgas</b> cleaning system is to recycle {{the bulk of the}} <b>offgas</b> stream to the thermal treatment process. A slip stream is taken off the <b>offgas</b> recycle to separate and purge benign constituents that may build up in the gas, such as water vapor, argon, nitrogen, and CO 2. Contaminants are separated from the slip stream and returned to the thermal unit for eventual destruction or incorporation into the waste immobilization media. In the current study, a standard packed-bed scrubber, followed by gas separation membranes, is proposed for removal of contaminants from the <b>offgas</b> recycle slipstream. The scrub solution is continuously regenerated by cooling and precipitating sulfate, nitrate, and other salts that reach a solubility limit in the scrub solution. Mercury is also separated by the scrubber. A miscible chemical oxidizing agent was shown to effectively oxidize mercury and also NO, thus increasing their removal efficiency. The current study indicates that the proposed process is a viable option for reducing <b>offgas</b> emissions. Consideration of the proposed closed-system <b>offgas</b> cleaning loop is warranted when emissions limits are stringent, or when a reduction in the total gas emissions volume is desired. Although the current closed-loop appears to be technically feasible, economical considerations must be also be evaluated on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

50|$|Unlike many {{foam-in-place}} polyurethane foams, it is nonflammable and non-toxic. As it is water-based, it <b>offgasses</b> {{water vapour}} while curing, requiring ventilation {{and in some}} cases an dehumidifier. It cures more slowly than organic foams. However, it does not <b>offgas</b> volatile organic compounds as many organic foams do. Like cement, it is water-soluble until cured, but after curing it is water-resistant, but water-permeable.|$|R
50|$|Many {{sources of}} {{reclaimed}} wood cannot verify what the wood {{might have been}} treated with over its lifetime. This uncertainty leads to fears of harmful <b>offgassing</b> of volatile organic compounds associated with lead paint or various stains and treatments {{that may have been}} used on the wood. These fears are particularly pressing when the wood is for an interior application.|$|E
50|$|Another {{source of}} {{reclaimed}} wood is old snowfence. At {{the end of}} their tenure on the mountains and plains of the Rocky Mountain region, snowfence boards are a valued source of consistent, structurally sound and reliable reclaimed wood. In many locations the water content of snowfence wood naturally drops to two percent, minimizing the need for treatment and thereby avoiding the risk of harmful <b>offgassing</b> associated with many types of reclaimed wood.|$|E
50|$|Outgassing (sometimes called <b>offgassing,</b> {{particularly}} when {{in reference to}} indoor air quality) is {{the release of a}} gas that was dissolved, trapped, frozen or absorbed in some material. Outgassing can include sublimation and evaporation (which are phase transitions of a substance into a gas), as well as desorption, seepage from cracks or internal volumes, and gaseous products of slow chemical reactions. Boiling is generally thought of as a separate phenomenon from outgassing because it consists of a phase transition of a liquid into a vapor of the same substance.|$|E
50|$|Efficient {{process heating}} {{requires}} {{recovery of the}} largest possible part of a fuel’s heat of combustion into the material being processed. There are many avenues of loss {{in the operation of}} a heating process. Typically, the dominant loss is sensible heat leaving with the <b>offgas</b> (i.e., the flue gas). The temperature and quantity of <b>offgas</b> indicates its heat content (enthalpy), so keeping its quantity low minimizes heat loss.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} technical feasibility of upgrading the Waste Experimental Reduction Facility (WERF) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to meet the <b>offgas</b> emission limits proposed in the Maximum Achievable Control Technologies (MACT) rule. Four practicable <b>offgas</b> treatment processes were identified, which, if installed, would enable the WERF to meet the anticipated MACT emission limits for dioxins and furans (D/F), hydrochloric acid (HCI), and mercury (Hg). Due to the three-year time restraint for MACT compliance, any technology chosen for the upgrade must be performed within the general plant project funding limit of $ 5 M. The option selected consists of a partial-quench evaporative cooler with dry sorbent injection for HCI removal followed by a sulfur-impregnated activated carbon bed for Hg control. The planning cost estimate for implementing the option is $ 4. 17 M (with 24 % contingency). The total estimated cost includes capital costs, design and construction costs, and project management costs. Capital costs include {{the purchase of a}} new <b>offgas</b> evaporative cooler, a dry sorbent injection system with reagent storage, a new fabric filter baghouse, a fixed carbon bed absorber, and two <b>offgas</b> induced draft exhaust fans. It is estimated that 21 months will be required to complete the recommended modification to the WERF. The partial-quench cooler is designed to rapidly cool the <b>offgas</b> exiting the secondary combustion chamber to minimize D/F formation. Dry sorbent injection of an alkali reagent into the <b>offgas</b> is recommended. The alkali reacts with the HCI to form a salt, which is captured with the fly ash in the baghouse. A design HCI removal efficiency of 97. 2 % allows for the feeding 20 lbs/hr of chlorine to the WERF incinerator. The sorbent feed rate can be adjusted to achieve the desired HCI removal efficiency. A fixed bed of sulfur-impregnated carbon was conservatively sized for a total Hg removal capacity when feeding 10 g/hr Hg to the WERF incinerator. An added benefit for using carbon adsorption is that the activated carbon will also capture a large fraction of any residual D/F present in the <b>offgas...</b>|$|R

The objectives for this test program included measuring incinerator <b>offgas</b> particulate loading and size distributions {{as a function of}} several operating variables, characterizing kiln bottom ash and <b>offgas</b> particulates, determining heavy metal partition between the kiln bottom ash and incinerator stack gas, and measuring kiln organics emissions (particularly polychlorinated dioxins and furans). These tests were designed to investigate the effect of the following operating parameters: Incineration Temperature; Waste Feed Rate; Waste Density; Kiln Solids Residence Time; and Waste Composition. Tests were conducted at three kiln operating temperatures. Three solid waste simulants were burned, two waste mixtures (paper, plastic, latex, and PVC) with one containing spiked toxic organic and metal compounds, and one waste type containing only paper.

This sampling work was performed by John Harden of the Clemson Environmental Technologies Laboratory, under SCUREF Task SC 0056. Elemental analyses were performed by the SRTC Mobile Laboratory. Operation of the Am/Cm melter with B 2000 frit has resulted in deposition of PbO and boron compounds in the <b>offgas</b> system that has contributed to pluggage of the High Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME). Sampling of the <b>offgas</b> system was performed to quantify the amount of particulate in the <b>offgas</b> system under several sets of conditions. Particulate concentration and particle size distribution were measured just downstream of the melter pressure control air addition port and at the HEME inlet. At both locations, the particulate was measured with and without steam to the film cooler while the melter was idled at about 1450 degrees Celsius. Additional determinations were made at the melter location during feeding and during idling at 1150 degrees Celsius rather than 1450 degrees Celsius (both with no steam to the film cooler).

40|$|CANSOLV SO 2 Scrubbing in Refinery Applications Tighter regulations, an {{increasing}} spread between {{sweet and sour}} crude prices and attractive revenue opportunities for sulfur and its byproducts have led refiners to increase their use of high sulfur fuels internally and install flue gas desulfurization systems to capture SO 2.
