5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} likely that he became an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed <b>on</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E

5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption have found mixed evidence. However, some evidence suggests that individuals consume more alcohol during the luteal stage, especially if these individuals are heavy drinkers or {{have a family history}} of alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence <b>on</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were followed closely in the press. Outside of cricket, {{he worked for a}} brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered from the effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence <b>on</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E

In Gazza: My Story, and in Being Gazza: Tackling My Demons, {{he refers to}} treatment for bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and alcoholism. The books also describes his addictive personality, which has led him to develop addictions of varying severity <b>on</b> <b>alcohol,</b> cocaine, chain smoking, gambling, high-caffeine energy drinks, exercise, and junk food.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> and prostitutes.|$|E

Platinum nanoparticles were depositedonto the chemically-oxidized MWNTs in 1 -propanol and 1, 3 -propanediol. The reduction of Pt precursors in othersolutions could induce differences in their morphologies in composite thin films. The morphologies of MWNTs withPt deposited were dependent on the reduction solutions, and the electrocatalytic activities <b>on</b> <b>alcohols</b> changedaccordingly.

5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.|$|E
5|$|With Kogălniceanu's participation, {{the authoritarian}} regime {{established}} by Cuza succeeded in promulgating {{a series of}} reforms, notably introducing the Napoleonic code, public education, and state monopolies <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom he dismissed soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, {{no longer able to}} provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own camarilla (courtiers).|$|E
5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence <b>on</b> <b>alcohol.</b> In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied <b>on</b> <b>alcohol,</b> tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

5|$|The 1863–64 season saw Wills' {{engagement}} to Anderson collapse, possibly {{due to his}} womanising, and {{it was revealed that}} he had been mismanaging Cullin-la-ringo, in part by squandering family finances <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> while claiming it as station expenditure. The trustees demanded that he stay in Victoria to answer for the property's runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr's XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand. Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII {{at the end of the}} tour in Melbourne. He faced the trustees soon after. His mother struggled to condemn him but ultimately approved his dismissal from Cullin-la-ringo, thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio's will.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's {{share of}} the vote {{declined}} continually despite the economic growth, and they clung to power mainly due to the Playmander. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater Don Dunstan combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle class, which wanted more government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws <b>on</b> <b>alcohol,</b> gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election. He relinquished the party leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards {{until his death in}} 1981.|$|E

Fatboy grows jealous when he sees Mercy with Seb Parker (Tommy Bastow), and assumes they are having sex. Mercy reveals she may face exportation as her visa has expired, and Fatboy tells Ashley he {{is in love with}} Mercy. Ashley reports Mercy to the UK Border Agency so that Fatboy will forget about her, and she decides to leave before she has been asked to. Fatboy and Mercy say an emotional goodbye, but Fatboy stops her taxi and proposes marriage, realising she can stay in the country if they are married. Mercy agrees but Grace is opposed to the plan until she realises that Fatboy loves Mercy. Kim points out that Fatboy seems embarrassed about getting married and that Mercy does not seem to love him, and admits to fancying Fatboy. Fatboy then tells Kim why he is really marrying Mercy, but also that he wants to be married for real.|$|E
