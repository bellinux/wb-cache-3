5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E

5|$|Despite Daniel's injury {{late in the}} season, the Canucks {{won their}} second {{consecutive}} Presidents' Trophy. He remained out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> {{for the first three}} games of the 2012 playoffs, all of which the Canucks lost against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings. Returning for Game 4, Daniel helped the Canucks stave off elimination before they were defeated the following contest. In his two games played in the series, he recorded two assists.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{struggled}} in 2001–02, finishing {{with a team}} worst −24 plus/minus while occasionally being left out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> as a healthy scratch. Unhappy with his season, he focused on improving his game. He overcame rib, abdominal and wrist injuries in 2002–03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication. The Flames rewarded him with a five-year contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. They also named him an alternate captain, a position he continuously held {{for the remainder of}} his stay in Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Selänne {{made his}} final post-season {{appearance}} during the 2014 playoffs. He had six points in 12 games, {{but was also}} held out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for one game against the Dallas Stars, a decision that angered Ducks fans. He played his final game on May 16, 2014, as the Ducks were eliminated by Los Angeles. Following the contest, Selänne was saluted by fans, teammates and opponents alike, and took a final lap around the rink.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} false memories are often present in eyewitness testimonies. However, there is not much research as to <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> timing in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> false memories. In this experiment, undergraduate students watched a short video clip of a perpetrator committing a crime. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions, which varied in time intervals between <b>the</b> viewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime and <b>the</b> viewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineups.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was to see how likely false recognitions are to occur as the time between <b>the</b> viewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime and <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> is changed. In addition, we examined <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> misattribution on <b>the</b> first <b>lineup</b> on false memory in a second lineup...|$|R

5|$|The trade {{provided}} immediate dividends for the Flames, as Kiprusoff recorded 22 saves in a 2–1 {{victory over}} the Montreal Canadiens {{in his first game}} with Calgary on November 20. He won 12 of 17 starts between November 20 and December 29, giving up one goal or fewer 11 times in that stretch. He was named the defensive player of the month for December by the League, but suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his knee {{at the end of the}} month that forced him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with Edmonton's Dan McGillis {{early in the}} 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina's roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team {{at both ends of}} the ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E

5|$|After two injury plagued {{seasons with}} the Red Wings, Samuelsson agreed to a one-year {{contract}} with Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) on July 29, 2014. Samuelsson's season in Djurgården began with the premiere season of the Champions Hockey League. In the three group stage games he participated in, Samuelsson scored two goals and three points. He scored his first goal for Djurgården in the sixth round of the SHL regular season, a 4–5 loss against Örebro HK. He then injured his knee on October 16 and was out of play until October 28. Samuelsson was again out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> between January 10 and February 19 due to a groin injury, missing 11 games. At {{the end of the}} SHL regular season, Samuelsson had scored 13 goals and 26 points in 37 games. He announced his retirement from professional hockey on March 26, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Bertuzzi {{returned}} to action on March 22, 2007, debuting {{with his new}} team in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Eight days later, he scored his first goal as a Red Wing in a 4–3 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars. On April 7, he suffered a neck injury that kept him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for the last game {{of the regular season}} and the first two games of the 2007 playoffs. He finished the campaign with 11 points in 15 games split between Florida and Detroit. During the playoffs, the Red Wings advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in six games to the Anaheim Ducks, who {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. Bertuzzi recorded 7 points in 16 playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{was set to}} {{make his}} much-anticipated return to Vancouver to play the Canucks on November 5, 1999, but was kept out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> due to a broken finger. A prior groin injury had also forced {{him out of a}} Panther's home game against the Canucks earlier in the season. During the season, he was named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, where he {{recorded}} an assist and the eleventh hat trick {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game. Of Bure's three goals, two were assisted by his brother Valeri, who played on the same line with him, along with his Panthers linemate, Viktor Kozlov. Helping lead the World team to a 9–4 victory over North America, Bure was named the All-Star Game MVP.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup.</b> After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go behind the plate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} game of the 2012–13 season, Nash {{suffered}} a non-displaced fracture in his left leg after a collision with Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers. He was expected to miss at least one week, but was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for close to seven weeks. He was reunited with D'Antoni, who took over as Lakers coach after Mike Brown was fired after a 1–4 start. On 22 December, Nash returned against the Golden State Warriors, helping the Lakers win their first overtime game of the season, 118–115, scoring 12 points with 9 assists in 41 minutes of play. The Lakers won three of the first four games after Nash returned. However, they lost their next four, including a 125–112 loss to Houston on 8 January 2013, when Nash assisted on an Antawn Jamison jumper to become the fifth player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career assists.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which kept him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was {{in the last year}} of his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{consistency}} <b>of</b> observers’ responses {{was also}} assessed {{as a function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order in which <b>the</b> six <b>lineups</b> were shown, by calculating <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> observers who made a correct response on <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineups</b> and then carried on {{to do so without}} interruption on subsequent trials. These data are given in Fig. 4 d and show that 48 % of observers based their identification decisions on <b>the</b> target in <b>Lineup</b> 1, but only 5 % of observers based their identification decisions consistently on the target across all six lineups, Z(1, N[*]=[*] 40)[*]=[*] 4.12, p[*]<[*]. 01.|$|R

5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup,</b> Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|Selänne then {{declined}} {{an option}} in his contract {{that would have}} paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya. The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup. Their hope failed to materialize, however, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points—the lowest totals of his career to that date—and was ultimately relegated to Colorado's fourth line, but was also held out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> as a healthy scratch during a playoff game. He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a labour dispute, took the time off to recover.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Djurgården in May 2008. The club's initial plan for Josefson {{was to move}} {{him up to the}} senior team when regular players were out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> with illness or injuries, while his usual team would be the J20-team. He scored his first goal in Elitserien on 23 September in his third game, a 4–1 win against Brynäs IF. Ultimately, Josefson played almost every game of the regular season, and usually played along with Carl Gustafsson and Henrik Eriksson on the 4th line. At the end of the season, Josefson had scored 5 goals and 16 points, a record for players 18 or younger playing with the senior team. Josefson was ranked third in the midterm rankings among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected {{in the first round of}} the 2009 NHL draft by the New Jersey Devils, 20th overall. Josefson was also drafted in the third round, 61st overall, in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft by SKA Saint Petersburg. He participated at the Devils rookie camp in July 2009. He has been compared with centres Nicklas Bäckström and John Madden.|$|E
