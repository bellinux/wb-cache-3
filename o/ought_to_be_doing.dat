Goldwater believed that the Tennessee Valley Authority should be sold into the private sector. On foreign policy, Goldwater's beliefs differed sharply from those of his opponent, who advocated limited involvement in Vietnam, maintaining that he would not send [...] "American boys nine or ten thousand miles from home to do what Asian boys <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> for themselves." [...] Goldwater, however, accused Johnson and the Democratic party of having given in on the issue of Communist aggression.|$|E

In this paper, {{following}} {{the work of}} Hare, we consider moral reasoning not as the application of moral norms and principles, but as reasoning about what <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a particular situation, with moral norms perhaps emerging from this reasoning. We model this situated reasoning drawing on our previous work on argumentation schemes, here set {{in the context of}} Action-Based Alternating Transition Systems. We distinguish what prudentially <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> from what morally <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> consider what legislation might be appropriate and characterise the differences between morally correct, morally praiseworthy and morally excusable actions. ...|$|R

She said that she was a Socialist, and there was still in Mr. Direck's composition a streak of the old-fashioned American prejudice against the word. He associated Socialists with Anarchists and deported aliens. It was manifest too that she was deeply read in the essays and dissertations of Mr. Britling. She thought everybody, man or woman, ought to be chiefly engaged in doing something definite for the world at large. ("There's my secretaryship of the Massachusetts Modern Thought Society, anyhow," [...] said Mr. Direck.) And she herself wanted to be doing something--it was just because she did not know what it was she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> that she was reading so extensively and voraciously. She wanted to lose herself in something. Deep in the being of Mr. Direck was the conviction that what she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> was making love in a rapturously egotistical manner, and enjoying every scrap of her own delightful self and her own delightful vitality--while she had it, but for the purposes of their conversation he did not care to put it any more definitely than to say that he thought we owed it to ourselves to develop our personalities. Upon which she joined issue with great vigour.|$|E

She knew well that Lady Mason was at The Cleeve, and {{believed}} that she was about to become the wife of Sir Peregrine; but she knew also that Lucius was at home, and it might be well to let him know what was going on. She had just seen Lucius Mason when she was met by Mrs. Furnival's fly. She had seen Lucius Mason, and the angry manner in which he declared that he could in no way interfere in his mother's affairs had frightened her. [...] "But, Mr. Lucius," [...] she had said, [...] "she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something, you know. There is no believing how bitter Samuel is about it." ...|$|E

She was like a devoted slave, {{so in love with}} the chains that she never knew she wore them. And to Laurence, who had so little sense of property, this only served to deepen tenderness, and the hold she had on him. He had resolved not to tell her of the new danger he ran from his own conscience. But resolutions with him were but the opposites of what was sure to come; and at last the words: ...|$|E
