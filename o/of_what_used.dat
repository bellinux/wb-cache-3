5|$|Because Stretford is {{situated}} on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be the Bass Drum public house, {{was one of the}} main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, about the time that horse-drawn omnibuses arrived, in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10minutes between 8:00am and 10:15pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the death of Muhammad on 6 July 632, Islam had {{effectively}} unified the entire Arabian peninsula.

25|$|In 1914, {{following}} amalgamation with Strathcona, Edmonton {{adopted a}} new street numbering system, which {{with a few}} small modifications is still in use. The centre of the city, Jasper Avenue and 101 Street, was set as the starting point. Jasper Avenue {{was one of the}} few streets that was not assigned a number. The other avenues were numbered as if Jasper Avenue (between 124 Street and 97 Street) had been 101 Avenue. Several other streets have maintained their names despite of having been reassigned as numbers — these include but are not limited to Whyte (82) Avenue, Norwood Boulevard (111 Avenue), and Alberta (118) Avenue, while others were given new names over time, such as Rue Hull (99) Street - which is a segment <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be Queens Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations {{of things in}} life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made for children of the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and {{based on what they}} see in media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be common.|$|E

It is the eastern section <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be Route 24 before that road was realigned to its current freeway alignment. The western end is at an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (US202) and County Route 510 (CR510) in Morristown, Morris County; the eastern end continues as CR603 on Springfield Avenue at the border between Maplewood and Irvington in Essex County. The route runs through suburban areas of Morris County, passing through Madison and Chatham. It interchanges with Route 24 on the border of Millburn, Essex County and Summit, Union County and serves as a frontage road for that route. Upon splitting from Route 24, Route 124 continues east through Springfield Township, Union Township, and Maplewood to its eastern terminus.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia [...] "commit Anglicans to {{mainstream}} Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct {{it to that}} particular tradition within as [...] "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church had {{to work out the}} meaning of its common heritage [...] "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" [...] but [...] "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted... has highlighted differences." [...] Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's [...] "unique or essential identity" [...] as having [...] "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" [...] that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of [...] "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that incarnational reality [...] "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." [...] Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an [...] "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" [...] that is combined with [...] "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism. Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson [...] "returned it firmly to a moderate position".|$|E

The dining room was {{in the rear of}} the hotel, on the site <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be Farnham House (which in {{photographs}} from the period shows as the last three windows on 14th Street).

2500|$|As time passed, {{more and}} more of a hip-hop {{influence}} crept into go-go. Early MCs like D.C. Scorpio gave way to DJ Kool, whose 1996 indie release, [...] "Let Me Clear My Throat"—based on a sample from DJ Mark the 45 King’s “The 900 Number”—was picked up by American Recordings and in 1997 became go-go's last certifiable hit single (#4 on Billboard's Rap singles chart, #21 on the R/Hip-Hop singles chart, and #30 on the Hot 100). As the hip-hop content in go-go increased, the complexity of the musical arrangements decreased. Where bands once featured horn sections and multiple guitarists in addition to a phalanx of percussionists, many current go-go bands have stripped down to just keyboards and percussion. [...] Another trend is to have a dedicated percussionist with plastic [...] "wood blocks" [...] performing much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be handled by the Junior Congas.|$|E
2500|$|Xochimilco is {{characterized}} by a system of canals, which measure about a total of 170km2. [...] These canals, and the small colorful boats that float on them among artificially created land called chinampas are internationally famous. These canals are popular with Mexico City residents as well, especially on Sundays. These canals are all of what is left <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>used</b> to be a vast lake and canal system that extended over most parts of the Valley of Mexico, restricting cities such as Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) and Xochimilco to small islands. This system of waterways was the main transportation venue, especially for goods from the pre-Hispanic period until the 20th century. [...] In the pre-Hispanic period, parts of the shallow lakes were filled in, creating canals. Starting in the early colonial period, the interconnected lakes of the valley, including Lake Xochimilco, were drained. By the 20th century, the lakes had shrunk to a system of canals that still connected Xochimilco with the center of Mexico City. However, with the pumping of underground aquifers since the early 20th century, water tables have dropped, drying canals, and all that are left are the ones in Xochimilco. The canals are fed by fresh water springs, which is artificially supplemented by treated water. This because water tables are still dropping and human expansion and filling in of canals is still occurring, threatening to have the last of these canals disappear despite their importance to tourism.|$|E
