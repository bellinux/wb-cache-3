5|$|The church {{formally}} {{announced the}} change on June 9, 1978. The story led many national news broadcasts and was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of most American newspapers, {{and in most}} largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho, telephone networks were completely jammed with excited callers. The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.|$|E
5|$|The former Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero {{is often}} mocked {{in his own}} country for his facial {{resemblance}} to Mr. Bean, and a computer hacker broke into Spain's official website for its presidency of the European Union, inserting the character <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the website. Satirists have also compared Zapatero to Mr. Bean when discussing government policies that are deemed to have been unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pamphlet A Tryal of Witches, {{taken from}} a contemporary report of the proceedings, erroneously dates the trial as March 1664, both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> and introduction. Original documents in the Public Record Office and other contemporary records clearly states it {{took place in the}} 14th year of the reign of Charles II (30 January 1662 to 29 January 1663).|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{takes the}} draft of the {{education}} bill to the Herald’s political editor, Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus), and its chief editor, Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver), who gives her the lead on the story over the more experienced chief political correspondent Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer). The episode ends the morning after Walker’s inauguration, with Frank visiting his favorite restaurant, Freddy’s BBQ Joint, for breakfast. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Washington Herald is Zoe’s story about Blythe’s “far left” education plan.|$|E
5|$|It {{stayed with}} an eight-column format until September 7, 1976, years after other papers had {{switched}} to six, {{and it was}} one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> appearing on October 16, 1997. In the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.|$|E
50|$|During the funeral, {{there were}} scenes of {{tension in the}} congregation, with some fainting. Although no journalists entered the Basilica, photos of the coffins of the three-year-old twins {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of most national newspapers the following day, leading to strong anti-ETA sentiment.|$|R

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off {{and went on to}} chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E
5|$|For {{her actions}} {{in the battle for}} the village of Kozyi Gory (Smolensk Oblast), Shanina was awarded her first {{military}} decoration, the Order of Glory 3rd Class on 17 April 1944. She became the first Soviet female sniper and the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order. According to the report of Major Degtyarev (the commander of the 1138th Rifle Regiment), she received the award for the corresponding commendation list, between 6 and 11 April Shanina killed 13 enemy soldiers while subjected to artillery and machine gun fire. By May 1944, her sniper tally increased to 17 confirmed enemy kills, and Shanina was praised as a precise and brave soldier. The same year, on 9 June, Shanina's portrait was featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Soviet newspaper Unichtozhim Vraga.|$|E
50|$|Karskiy was {{the author}} of at least 100 {{significant}} scientific works. Some of the major ones are listed below.

50|$|Sensing {{a golden}} opportunity, Tatum manipulates the rescue effort, convincing an unscrupulous sheriff to {{pressure}} the construction contractor charged with the rescue into drilling from above, rather than shoring up the existing passages, so that Tatum can prolong his stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers nationwide.|$|R
5|$|Photographs {{taken by}} Malcolm Browne of the {{self-immolation}} quickly {{spread across the}} wire services and were featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers worldwide.

5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and {{is believed to be the}} last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At {{the peak of the}} comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E
5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page.</b> The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E
30|$|The {{cases of}} slums’ rebellions – that {{now and then}} show up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of {{newspapers}} and have been masterly depicted in the Cannes’ prize-winner French movie “La haine” – are {{not even the most}} critical part of the anonymous and unruly mood of the suburbanites.|$|R
50|$|Since its opening, {{the resort}} {{and the events}} that took place within its grounds have {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of tabloids with visits from The Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, {{as well as other}} celebrities of the era such as Cary Grant and Lucille Ball.|$|R
50|$|Photographs {{taken by}} Malcolm Browne of the {{self-immolation}} quickly {{spread across the}} wire services and were featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers worldwide.

5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently {{was the result of the}} discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|Castro became {{critical}} of the corruption and violence of Grau's regime, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him a place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of several newspapers. In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular – PSP), the Socialist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR) and the Insurrectional Revolutionary Union (Unión Insurrecional Revolucionaria – UIR) – he grew close to the UIR, although biographers are unsure whether he became a member. In 1947, Castro joined a new socialist group, the Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás (1907–1951). A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging {{him to leave the}} university; he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang-related assassinations during this period, including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez, MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez, but these charges remain unproven.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling {{became a}} medal sport {{for the first}} time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink {{finished}} first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, {{but there was a}} strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> of the New York Times. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.|$|E
50|$|Samuels {{struggled}} with {{drug and alcohol}} abuse during his youth. Given that his father was an influential politician, Samuels' drug-related arrests received major media exposure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of both <b>the</b> New York Post and New York Daily News. His court cases were covered in Rolling Stone magazine and Newsweek.|$|R
50|$|The Freethinking Atheist and Agnostic Kinship {{has been}} {{featured}} in the Orange County Weekly, Orange County Register and national TV’s The O'Reilly Factor. In addition, the club has organized several rallies each drawing over 200 picketers. These rallies have landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of Orange County Register and Los Angeles Times.|$|R
50|$|On July 25, 1888, McGurrin, who was purportedly {{the only}} person using touch typing at the time, won a decisive victory over Louis Traub (operating Caligraph with eight-finger method) in a typing contest held in Cincinnati. The results were {{displayed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of many newspapers. McGurrin won $500 ($10,820 in 2006) and popularized the new typing method.|$|R
