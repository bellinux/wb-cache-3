30|$|However, this study’s {{findings}} cannot {{serve as}} a basis for generalization because its scope is limited to <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> in Nigeria. We also note that emerging economies such as Nigeria may sometimes have low stock liquidity (Onoh 2016). Hence, {{the results of this study}} must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, despite these caveats, our findings shed light on the relationship between oil prices and <b>oil</b> <b>stocks.</b> Future efforts could focus on testing the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> and <b>oil</b> price shocks in other major oil exporting countries.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine whether the {{volatility}} of the growth in the US <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> has changed overtime, and if it has then whether or not this change is real. We find that the growth in volatility of <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> has declined overtime. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation exercise to investigate whether this decline is real or an artefact of the growth definition. Our findings support the fact that the decline in growth volatility of <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> is an artefact of the growth definition. This is because a data generating process having a unit root with drift has a tendency to grow and thereby pulls the variance of growth down with time. <br /...|$|R

30|$|The {{results in}} Table  1 {{show that in}} the {{economic}} factor group, all of the examined variables satisfy the first criterion. But considering the second criterion, DJI, the most representative barometer of the American economy and worldwide mature stock market, is the most appropriate. In the fundamental market factor group, non-OECD oil demand, worldwide oil demand, OECD <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> and OPEC surplus oil production capacity have economic significance on the international Brent crude oil prices. OECD <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> is the most appropriate factor, because in some sense, the difference between oil supply and oil demand has reflected the change in <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> and these two types, which represent the fundamental variables, cannot be used simultaneously. Besides, compared to OPEC surplus oil production capacity, OECD <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> are more negatively related to the Brent oil prices. In the oil exploration technology group, we select the US rotary rig count, highly positively related to Brent oil prices. In the financial market factor group, US dollar index (USD), as an aggregative indicator of the weighted average value of six major currencies against US dollars, reflects the exchange rate of US dollars in the international foreign exchange market and measures the exchange rate of the US dollars against a basket of currencies. USD has a strong negative correlation coefficient on Brent oil prices. In oil exploration technology, we select the US rotary oil rig count as a proxy. In the speculation factor group, the net positions of Large traders, Managed money and Small traders have economic significance for Brent oil prices. TOI, however, has a more positive relationship on Brent oil prices. Important geopolitical and historical events (e.g., the Second Gulf War from August 1990 to April 1991 and the Iraq War in 2002) are also accounted for by using 0 – 1 dummy variables.|$|R

40|$|We assess {{claims that}} OPEC's ability to {{influence}} real oil prices has diminished and {{that the relationship between}} real oil prices and OPEC production can be used to test competing hypotheses about OPEC behavior. An econometric analysis indicates that there is a statistically significant relationship among real oil prices, OPEC capacity utilization, OPEC quotas, the degree to which OPEC exceeds these production quotas, and OECD <b>stocks</b> of crude <b>oil.</b> These variables "Granger cause" real oil prices but real oil prices do not "Granger cause" these variables. These results imply that OPEC influences oil prices and that previous models cannot be used to test competing models for OPEC production behavior. The effect of OECD <b>oil</b> <b>stocks</b> on real <b>oil</b> prices indicates that there may be an important externality in private decisions regarding optimal crude <b>oil</b> <b>stocks.</b> ...|$|R
