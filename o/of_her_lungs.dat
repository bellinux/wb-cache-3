25|$|In this piece, Abramović kneeled {{alone and}} naked {{in a room}} with a {{high-power}} industrial fan. She approached the fan slowly, attempting to breathe in as much air as possible to push the limits <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b> Soon after she lost consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{had serious}} {{pneumonia}} {{when she was}} four years old; fluid filled one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs</b> and surgeons considered removing the lung. She was instead hospitalised for three months at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and underwent several operations to drain her lungs.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was later}} hospitalized for a {{pulmonary}} infection and developed pneumonia, which {{caused her to}} be hospitalized for an extended period. She arrived at a Bob Newhart Show cast reunion in September 2007 in a wheelchair, which raised concern about her health, although she insisted that she was [...] "cancer-free." [...] (She was seated in a regular chair during the actual telecast.) During an interview in USA Today given {{at the time of}} the reunion, Pleshette stated that she had been released four days earlier from the hospital where, as part of her cancer treatment, part of one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs</b> had been removed.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{pulmonary}} cryptococcosis in an immunocompromised patient who had focal endobronchial lesions. When we first examined <b>her,</b> she complained <b>of</b> a productive cough that had lasted for two months. Seventeen months prior to this examination, she {{had been diagnosed with}} Sjogren syndrome and Sweet syndrome. Since that diagnosis, her condition had been maintained with low-dose prednisolone. We performed a chest CT scan, which revealed a mass, 3 cm in diameter, in the upper lobe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left <b>lung.</b> A bronchoscopic examination revealed 3 white, elevated lesions in the upper lobe bronchus <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left <b>lung.</b> After 40 days of treatment with fluconazole, the shadow <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> mass decreased in size to that of a scarred lesion and her white, elevated bronchial lesions disappeared...|$|R
50|$|On 28 February 2012, Flor Silvestre {{underwent}} surgery to extirpate the cancer-stricken half <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung.</b> She responded {{well to the}} surgery.|$|R
40|$|Adenoid cystic {{carcinoma}} of the lung is a relatively rare, slow growing lung neoplasm. Metastases outside the lung are uncommon. Herein, we have reported {{the case of a}} patient who presented with a large mass in the right lower lobe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung.</b> Bronchial biopsy revealed features suggestive of adenoid cystic {{carcinoma of}} thelung with a predominant cribriform architecture. CT abdomen showed features of bilateral renal and liver metastases, but no adrenal metastases...|$|R
2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b> I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that {{she was not going to}} go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned out}} of the window and breathed to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> while the wind {{wrenched}} down her dishevelled hair and blew it below her waist.|$|E
6000|$|With a horrified scream {{the poor}} woman {{rose to her}} hands and knees, and in this {{position}} scurried across the room, shrieking: [...] "O Gaberelle! O Gaberelle!" [...] at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
40|$|A 51 -year-old woman {{diagnosed}} with {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) of the lung (T 2 N 2 M 0) by cytological tests and a CT scan has survived for 8 years. During this period of time, she had been treated with Chinese herbal medicine atone for 4 years. The herbal prescription consisted of nine Chinese medicinal herbs. These herbs {{have been reported to}} possess anti-tumour and immune enhancing effects. Therefore, it is suggested that the herbal treatment for this patient might have contributed to the complete regression <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> carcinoma. Further research on the actions of these herbs is warranted...|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Polish Catholic sisters Ewa (Marion Cotillard) and Magda (Angela Sarafyan) {{arrive at}} Ellis Island, New York City as {{immigrants}} {{looking for a}} better life after escaping their ravaged home in post-Great War Poland. Magda is quarantined because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> disease. Ewa is almost deported, but Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), who is Jewish, notices her and her fluency in English, bribes an officer to let her go, and takes her to his house. Knowing Ewa has to make money to get Magda released, Bruno lets her dance at the Bandits' Roost theater and prostitutes her. Bruno also becomes interested in her romantically.|$|R
30|$|The {{patient was}} given 2  l of {{intravenous}} normal saline {{in the emergency}} department and her vital signs normalized with a repeat blood pressure of 116 / 72 and heart rate <b>of</b> 80. <b>Her</b> <b>lungs</b> remained clear after rehydration. She {{was admitted to the}} oncology service for continued hydration and palliation therapy.|$|R
60|$|Soon the {{two boys}} were in pursuit, with the sailor close behind. Fortunately for the evildoers the spot was {{practically}} deserted, so that Dora could summon no assistance, even though she began {{to call for help}} at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mildred {{answered}} the cry, {{at the top}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> and immediately Inez followed with a shrill scream that roused a thousand echoes in the hidden passage. And now Toodlums joined the chorus, startled from her sleep and terrified by the riot of sound.|$|E
60|$|Marie soon {{returned}} with the doctor, old Auguste, and Tannis. Carey was carried in and laid on Mrs. Esquint's bed. The doctor made a brief examination, while Mrs. Joe {{sat on the floor}} and howled at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b> Then he shook his head.|$|E
50|$|Gerard became {{seriously ill}} with an {{infection}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung</b> in March 1929. She {{was confined to}} a nursing home in the West End of London. She died following an extended illness in London in 1942. She was 52 years old.|$|R
5000|$|September 16, 2011 — Kara Kennedy {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while exercising in a Washington, D.C. health club. Kara had {{reportedly}} suffered from lung cancer nine years earlier, but she had recovered after the removal <b>of</b> part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, Powers, who was {{a smoker}} for 20 years, was {{diagnosed}} with alveolar carcinoma, a form of lung cancer. [...] She had surgery to remove part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung</b> on January 29, 2009, the same month <b>her</b> mother died <b>of</b> pneumonia, aged 96, in Los Angeles.|$|R
60|$|She {{positively}} {{refused to}} be seated, but held out her hands as if for Joe to take {{her in his arms}} once more, and when the boy attempted to explain that it was necessary she remain there a few moments, the little maiden made protest at the full strength <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Noiselessly, {{they moved}} through the halls and {{corridors}} of the castle until a maid, bearing a great pasty from the kitchen, turned a sudden corner and bumped full into the Outlaw of Torn. With a shriek {{that might have been}} heard at Lewes, she dropped the dish upon the stone floor and, turning, ran, still shrieking at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> straight for the great dining hall.|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} damsel screeched {{at the top}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs</b> and, caught at the hair. The monkey cried, too, in concert, and then a young man rushed in to the rescue. But Jocko's blood was up, and, leaping to the young man's shoulder, he tore off his straw hat and began to pull it to bits. Then, with the hat still in his possession, he made a leap to the tree and joined his brother at the top.|$|E
5000|$|Morrison {{underwent}} a lumpectomy {{for breast cancer}} in 1988, followed by a full mastectomy when the cancer recurred in 1998. She had lung cancer and underwent surgery to remove the upper third <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung.</b> Morrison's lung cancer was in remission, but her breast cancer returned after the treatment in 1988 and 1998.|$|R
50|$|A young man, {{and several}} years later, a woman, undergo a Thai ritual of {{lying in a}} coffin, which is {{supposed}} to ensure long life and banish bad luck. The ritual is also seen as a solution to fatal genetic diseases and diseases like cancer. The man, Chris, wakes and is brought to the hospital where doctors say he suffers from hallucinations. It turns out that the hallucinations are paranormal visits by his ex-girlfriend and trying to kill him, who dies, along with her child, just when his wife is cured. The woman on the other hand is rid <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> cancer, however is haunted by her boyfriend, Jack, whom she was supposed to marry. The woman consults an expert in the paranormal, and later Chris, to try to solve her supernatural difficulties.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2008, Macchiarini {{conducted}} the world's first transplant of a donated trachea colonized with {{the stem cells}} of the patient, Claudia Castillo. [...] "After a severe collapse <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left <b>lung</b> in March, Castillo needed regular hospital visits to clear her airways {{and was unable to}} take care <b>of</b> <b>her</b> children." [...] The only treatment left to her following conventional medicine [...] "was a major operation to remove <b>her</b> left <b>lung</b> which carries a risk of complications and a high mortality rate." [...] Macchiarini proposed tissue engineering.|$|R
60|$|As {{they emerged}} from the hut they saw warriors running from every doorway. The old woman stood {{screaming}} in Piman at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b> Billy, keeping Barbara {{in front of him}} that he might shield her body with his own, turned directly out of the village. He did not fire at first hoping that they might elude detection and thus not draw the fire of the Indians upon them; but he was doomed to disappointment, and they had taken scarcely a dozen steps when a rifle spoke above the noise of human voices and a bullet whizzed past them.|$|E
6000|$|Early on {{the morning}} of September 11, I was aroused by a [...] "bob" [...] in the open before us. We started up, fearing that some death by {{accident}} had taken place: the occasion proved, on the contrary, to be one of ushering into life. The women were assembled in a ring round the mother, and each howled with all the might <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> either to keep off some evil spirit or to drown the sufferer's cries. In some parts of Africa, the Gold Coast for instance, it is considered infamous for a woman thus to betray her pain, but here we are amongst a softer race.|$|E
60|$|In {{this new}} dilemma, the girl once more availed herself of her slight {{knowledge}} of the place, and made a detour, which enabled her to shoot ahead of the fugitives and intercept them {{in one of the}} narrowest parts of the mountain-gorge. Here, instead of using her natural voice, she conceived that the likeliest way of making her terrified friends understand who she was, would be to shout with all the strength <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b> Accordingly, she planted herself suddenly in the centre of their path, just as the two came tearing blindly round a corner of rock, and set up a series of yells, the nature of which utterly beggars description.|$|E
40|$|Breast metastases from extramammary {{neoplasms}} {{are very}} rare. We presented a 66 year-old female with metastasis of small cell lung carcinoma to the breast. She presented with consolidation over the left upper lobe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> undetermined after endobronchial or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy, {{and this was}} treated effectively after antibiotic therapy at initial stage. The left breast lumps were noted 4 months later, and she underwent a modified radical mastectomy under the impression of primary breast carcinoma. However, the subsequent chest imaging revealed re-growing mass over the left mediastinum and hilum, and cells with the same morphological and staining features were found from specimens of transbronchial brushing and biopsy. An accurate diagnosis to distinguish a primary breast carcinoma from metastatic one is very important because the therapeutic planning and the outcome between them are different...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{polyarthritis}} is an uncommon, paraneoplastic {{manifestation of}} some solid and hematological malignancies. Herein, we report {{the case of}} a 55 -year-old woman who recently experienced polyarthritis for 2 months. On admission, the patient developed cough, expectoration, and fever. According to the clinical manifestations and the findings in radiological examinations and sputum cultures, pneumonia was considered. No evidence of lung cancer was noted by repeated computed tomography scan of lung, single bronchoscopy, or computed tomography–guided lung biopsy. Ultimately, the second bronchoscopy with biopsy was carried out, and lung adenocarcinoma was confirmed by pathological examination. Symptoms of polyarthritis starting 2 months before the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lung</b> cancer in the present case leads us to believe that polyarthritis may be a manifestation of paraneoplastic syndrome. Arthritis resolved after anticancer therapy. Our report indicates that polyarthritis of unknown cause may be suspected as a manifestation of malignancies...|$|R
50|$|When Flatow {{succumbed to}} fatal head wounds at Soroka Medical Center, the family donated her organs {{to save the}} lives of others. After doctors {{declared}} her brain dead, her father authorized the removal <b>of</b> <b>her</b> heart, <b>lungs,</b> kidneys, liver, pancreas and corneas. Thousands of people attended the memorial service in Flatow’s honor at Congregation Ahavas Achim B'nai Jacob and David in West Orange, New Jersey.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with me?" [...] he asked himself, sharply, but dared not answer his own question. He knew his malady. His unrest {{was that of the}} lover. Thereafter he gave himself up to the quiet joy of {{reviewing}} each word she had uttered, and in doing so {{came to the conclusion that}} she was in the mountains not so much for the cure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs</b> or throat as to heal the hurt of some injustice. What it was he could not imagine, but he believed that she was getting over it. [...] "As she gets over it she'll find life on the Shellfish intolerable and she'll go away," [...] he reasoned, and the thought of her going made his country lonesome, empty, and of no account.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{group by}} themselves, in an upper {{corner of the}} congregation, were four or five very old women, {{who were able to}} {{manifest}} their pious enthusiasm in no other way than by rocking their bodies backwards and forwards, and singing with their cracked voices a gruesome and monotonous chant. This rude song had something of a wild and uncivilized nature, as if it had come down to these old people from the savage rites of their African ancestors. They did not sing in unison, but each squeaked or piped out her, [...] "Yi, wiho, yi, hoo!" [...] according to the strength <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> and the degree of her exaltation. Prominent among these was old Aunt Patsy; her little black eyes sparkling through her great iron-bound spectacles; her head and body moving in unison with the wild air of the unintelligible chant she sang; her long, skinny hands clapping up and down upon her knees; while her feet, encased in their great green baize slippers, unceasingly beat time upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|We rested {{ourselves}} here five days; {{during which}} time we had abundance of pleasant adventures with the wild creatures, too many to relate. One of them was very particular, which was a chase between a she-lion, or lioness, and a large deer; and though the deer is naturally a very nimble creature, and she flew by us like the wind, having, perhaps, about 300 yards {{the start of the}} lion, yet we found the lion, by her strength, and the goodness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lungs,</b> got ground of her. They passed by us within {{about a quarter of a}} mile, and we had a view of them a great way, when, having given them over, we were surprised, about an hour after, to see them come thundering back again on the other side of us, and then the lion was within thirty or forty yards of her; and both straining to the extremity of their speed, when the deer, coming to the lake, plunged into the water, and swam for her life, as she had before run for it.|$|E
50|$|Sir Bernard Spilsbury {{performed}} the post-mortem and deduced that Mrs Fox had been strangled to death, {{due to a}} bruise on her larynx, and the absence <b>of</b> soot in <b>her</b> <b>lungs</b> showed {{that she had been}} dead before the fire had started. As a result, Fox {{was arrested and charged with}} the murder.|$|R
5000|$|Ms.Yeo was {{diagnosed}} with kidney cancer in 2007 while shooting the SBS movie The King and I. But she continued to act and began work on the KBS2 production of Jang-hwa and Hong-ryeon (The Tale of Two Sisters)., eventually quitting the production due to pneumonia, indicating the spread <b>of</b> cancer to <b>her</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2002, at age 42, Kennedy was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer. Initially told the disease was inoperable, she found — with her father's help — a surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, {{who was willing to}} remove part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>lung</b> in an effort to save her life. The operation was successful, and she resumed an active life that included regular running and swimming.|$|R
