These findings generally support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept.

40|$|Feather {{damaging}} behaviour in parrots and {{feather pecking}} in laying hens are behavioural disorders that may share an analogous background. In laying hens, a correlation {{has been found}} between the degree of feather pecking and the type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> a bird displays. Individuals from a high feather pecking line usually display a pro-active <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> (i. e. hawk-type), whereas birds from a low feather pecking line usually display a reactive <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> (i. e. dove-type). Dependent on the type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy,</b> birds may show a different response when confronted with stressing stimuli during a behavioural test. In parrots, the association between type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> and feather damaging behaviour may also be present. To test this hypothesis, three behavioural tests (manual restraint test, novel object test and the open field test) were performed {{in a group of}} 22 grey parrots with and without feather damaging behaviour. In the open field test was found that parrots without feather damaging behaviour showed lower open field activity then parrots with feather damaging behaviour, which is in accordance to findings in laying hens. With the manual restraint test we didn't find any significant outcomes in our data. However, it did appear that parrots with feather damaging behaviour struggled less, but more powerful, whereas parrots without feather damaging behaviour struggled more constant during the 5 -minute test. The results of the novel object test indicate that parrots with feather damaging behaviour show a lower degree of neophobia than parrots without feather damaging behaviour. Based on two out of three behavioural tests that were conducted, it can be concluded that an analogy is present in laying hens and parrots concerning the association between type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> and presence <b>of</b> behavioural disorder. Similar to feather pecking laying hens, parrots with feather damaging behaviour also display a pro-active <b>coping</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Due to {{physical}} and psychological changes during puberty, most common problem of young people is body image defined as degree of size, shape and general appearance. Wrong perception of body image and dissatisfaction with body image in people can lead to eating disorders and stress. Peace of mind {{is in fact a}} mental mechanism that people use it to reduce physical and emotional strains coping with stressful situations. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>of</b> adolescent girls and its relationship with their eating disorders. Methods: This is study is a cross-sectional study in which 573 female adolescent of Karaj participated. Two-Stage Random Sampling was used in this study. In this study, to assess people who are at risk of eating disorder, the nutritional approach assessment questionnaire of EAT- 26 was used, while Strategy Inventory Body Image Coping- BICSI questionnaire was used to determine the type <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> Results: In this study, the mean age of participants was 16. 6 (± 26 / 1) (19 - 14 years). In this study, 23. 7 % of participants had an eating disorder. Mental image of an individual of his body had significant correlation with eating disorder (P= 0. 000).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} possible relationships between psychological strengths, temperament and choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> The study was based on the assumption that a positive life orientation possibly has biological roots. Temperament was defined as a biological factor that influences a positive life orientation and psychological strength. Psychological strength was conceptualised as the presence of a sense of coherence and locus of control. Coping was defined as the choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> A secondary {{aim of this}} study was to determine if there are any gender differences between adolescents regarding psychological strengths, temperament and choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> Although there are telling indicators of the influence of temperament on negative life outcomes, the influence of temperament in positive life outcomes are not as clearly delineated. This is especially true regarding adolescents. Even though younger children and adults have been extensively studied regarding salutogenesis and temperament, few studies reported on adolescent salutogenesis and temperament. It was postulated that temperament would have a significant influence on a salutogenic view of life in adolescence and that this would in turn influence the typical ways in which adolescents cope or their choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> The research questions were concerned with the relationship between psychological strength measured as sense of coherence and locus of control, temperament and choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> respectively, as well as the ways in which temperament could predict a salutogenic life orientation and ways <b>of</b> <b>coping.</b> A dearth was noted in the literature regarding salutogenesis, temperament and the developmental aspects related to salutogenesis in adolescence. Few studies include adolescents as participants and few concentrate on biologically based variables related to salutogenesis. Few studies report on positive outcomes specifically as it relates to temperament. Lastly a lack of integrative thought in psychology regarding divergent fields like biology and psychology and how it relates to salutogenic functioning, are in evidence. Research questions were explored in a sample of 141 pupils completing Grade 11 at two multi-racial schools in the east of Johannesburg. This sample was taken from a population of urban adolescents with average socio-economic status, completing public schooling in either English or Afrikaans. The average age of participants was 17 years. The sample consisted of 65. 2 % girls and 34. 8 % boys. The sample further consisted of 12. 8 % Black English speaking participants, 77. 3 % White Afrikaans speaking participants and 9. 9 % Coloured Afrikaans speaking participants. Four self-report measures were used to measure sense of coherence, temperament and choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> These were the Orientation to Life Questionnaire (Antonovsky, 1987), the Locus of Control Inventory (Schepers, 1999), the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman et al., 1993) and the Adolescent Coping Scale (Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993). The Orientation to Life Questionnaire measures Comprehensibility, Manageability and Meaningfulness. The Locus of Control Inventory measures Internal locus of control, External locus of control and Autonomy. The Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire measures Impulsive sensation seeking, Neuroticism-anxiety, Aggression-hostility, Activity and Sociability. The Adolescent Coping Scale measures eighteen <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> Four subscales were removed due to low levels of internal reliability. Choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> was therefore only measured by fourteen of the original subscales which were Seek social support, Focus on solving the problem, Work hard and achieve, Worry, Invest in close friends, Wishful thinking, Tension reduction, Social action, Ignore the problem, Self-blame, Keep to self, Seek spiritual support, Seek professional help and Physical recreation. Data collected from the completed questionnaires were tested for normality of subscale distributions. T-tests for independent samples were used to determine whether adolescent boys and girls differed significantly on the mean test scores for sense of coherence, locus of control, choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> and temperament. Pearson’s correlation analysis and canonical correlation analyses were conducted to ascertain whether there were any meaningful patterns of relationships between the two sets of variables, i. e. salutogenic functioning and temperament. Finally logistical regression analyses were used to predict salutogenic outcomes based on a set of independent temperament variables. Results indicated gender differences regarding psychological strengths, temperament and coping behaviour. Adolescent boys presented with higher levels of Comprehensibility and Manageability than girls. Adolescent girls generally displayed higher levels of Internal locus of control and Neuroticism-anxiety. They tended to make use of Social support, Worry, Tension reduction and Self-blame as <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> There are strong relationships between the dimensions of psychological strength, temperament and choice <b>of</b> <b>coping</b> <b>strategy.</b> Certain temperament traits like Neuroticism-anxiety and Aggression-hostility contributed to low levels of coherence and external locus of control, as well as the use <b>of</b> dysfunctional <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> Temperament traits like Activity and Sociability contributed to high coherence, Autonomy and a choice <b>of</b> adaptive <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> These results indicate possible links between biological functioning and perception as well as coping behaviour. It may be concluded that there are links between psychological strengths like sense of coherence and locus of control, temperament and <b>coping.</b> The dynamics <b>of</b> the interaction between these variables are complex but becoming increasingly clear. Temperament traits contribute separately and in combination to perceptions of Comprehensibility, Manageability, Meaningfulness, control attributions and coping. It would therefore seem that constellations of traits exist that predict life orientation and behavioural outcomes. The ability to regulate emotion and attention, social adeptness and activity seem to be of particular importance in salutogenic perceptions and adaptive <b>coping.</b> The results <b>of</b> this study pertain to a particular sample of adolescents that cannot necessarily be generalised to other populations. It is recommended that this study should be replicated in more diverse samples especially from other cultures and communities. Care should be taken to develop and use measuring instruments applicable in a multi-cultural South African context and other indexes of biological functioning, salutogenesis and coping could be used. The findings of this study should be integrated to applicatory models when working with youths. Professor Anita Stuar...|$|R
