5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with no incident, {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E
2500|$|He {{repeatedly}} told John {{that someone}} could approach to leave them nearby if he put the gun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> (<b>beside</b> which he was {{looking out the window}} towards the negotiation post as he was talking to Jackson)if he placed the rifle on the table and kept his hands in view. [...] John replied with various rebuffs including 'don't bother, don't bother'.|$|E
5000|$|In Estonian, {{the ending}} -l {{is added to}} the genitive case, e.g. laud (<b>table)</b> - laual (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table).</b> <b>Besides</b> <b>the</b> meaning [...] "on", this case is also used to {{indicate}} ownership. For example, [...] "mehel on auto" [...] means [...] "the man owns a car".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I {{have been}} to Miss Lapidoth's, {{to ask her to}} come and sing for us," [...] said Gwendolen, laying her gloves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her, and looking down at them.|$|R
60|$|She ascended <b>the</b> tower noiselessly. <b>On</b> {{raising her}} head above the {{hatchway}} she beheld Swithin bending over a scroll of paper which lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him. <b>The</b> small lantern that illuminated it showed also {{that he was}} warmly {{wrapped up in a}} coat and thick cap, behind him standing <b>the</b> telescope <b>on</b> its frame.|$|R
60|$|I {{placed a}} phial of sulphuric acid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> my bed.|$|E
60|$|He took {{a box of}} Turkish {{make that}} stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
60|$|He unclasped the {{traveling}} machine from {{his wrist and}} laid it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> the Demon.|$|E
60|$|Ida Stirling {{was sitting}} by {{an open window}} of a very artistically-furnished room, with an English {{newspaper}} lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her, and <b>The</b> Colonist, which is published in British Columbia, on her knee. She fancied from <b>the</b> writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrapper that Arabella Kinnaird had sent her the former, {{and there was a}} paragraph in it which had interested her more than a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cyril," [...] {{the little}} wife began again, {{as she took}} over his cup of tea to his easy chair by the bow window, {{and set it down}} quietly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tiny round <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, [...] "where did you go this afternoon?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{seems that}} {{a bit of}} {{leftover}} food was all he asked in recompense. In a ballad recited by a woman, it is told that [...] "His was the wizard hand that toil'd / At midnight's witching hour / That gather'd the sheep from the coming storm", and all he required were [...] "scattered sheafs" [...] and [...] "cream-bowl" [...] left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> meal <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> herding animals as just mentioned, reaping and threshing may {{be added to the}} list of chores he performs.|$|R
60|$|And {{we went in}} to breakfast. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>beside</b> my plate, {{was lying}} a letter from Cynthia.|$|E
60|$|For answer Sir Alfred laid {{a bloated}} and {{exceedingly}} vulgar-looking plush tobacco-pouch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> the match-box.|$|E
60|$|And he pointed, {{with that}} same febrile {{movement}} of his, to the heap of gold standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> Lambert.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Shaw stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rug, looking rather grim; <b>the</b> bouquet lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and <b>beside</b> it a note, {{directed}} to [...] "Frank Moore, Esq.," [...] {{in a very}} decided hand, with a fierce-looking flourish after the [...] "Esq." [...] Pointing to this impressive epistle, Mr. Shaw said, knitting his black eyebrows {{as he looked at}} Fanny, [...] "I 'm going {{to put a stop to}} this nonsense at once; and if I see any more of it, I 'll send you to school in a Canadian convent." ...|$|R
60|$|Anne {{was reading}} in bed. Two candles stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her, in their rich light her face, her bare arm and {{shoulder}} took on warm hues and {{a sort of}} peach-like quality of surface. Here {{and there in the}} canopy above her carved golden petals shone brightly among profound shadows, and the soft light, falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sculptured panel of the bed, broke restlessly among the intricate roses, lingered in a broad caress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blown cheeks, the dimpled bellies, the tight, absurd little posteriors of the sprawling putti.|$|R
6000|$|Macallister {{took out}} a sketch in water-colour and held it up. It showed a strip of a steamer's deck, with the {{softened}} sunlight beating down through an awning upon a man in skipper's uniform who lay, cigar in hand, in a hammock that swung beneath the spars. He was, to judge from his expression, languidly contented with everything, {{and there was a}} big glass of amber-coloured liquid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, and a tier of bottles laid out upon the deck. Beneath it ran the legend, [...] "For men must work." ...|$|R
60|$|Having said this, he {{took his}} hat, which lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> my palette. Once more {{he looked at the}} portrait.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be ridiculous! Give {{me those}} decanters!" [...] Alan {{struggled}} {{out of his}} chair, and trembled over to where she had them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|BOBBY. [curious and interested, {{resuming}} {{his seat}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her]. What {{do you know}} about her? What {{do you know about}} all this sort of thing? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> round, green-covered <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her lay <b>the</b> quiet {{companion}} of her age, the large Bible, whose pages, like {{the gates of}} the celestial city, were not shut at all by day, a few old standard books, and the pleasant, rippling knitting, whose dreamy, irresponsible monotony is the best music of age.|$|R
50|$|In Braemar, once night falls, strange wild cries {{leap from}} the father’s mouth. Swaddled in a scarf of Rothman’s Plain smoke, he sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} as if keeping watch, a tumbler of brown liquid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rattan <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him. <b>The</b> words he once spoke to the starry sky in his ordinary voice, back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch in Durban, now come out as shouts, raw noises that tear at his smoker’s lungs. ‘Idioot,’ he shouts, ‘Klootzak! Keep on, now, keep on!’ The mother leaves him to it. After dinner she goes straight to their bedroom, tugs {{the door closed behind}} her with a click.|$|R
60|$|About an {{hour after}} we had found the lamps, Doctor Winchester arrived. He had a large parcel with him, which, when unwrapped, {{proved to be the}} mummy of a cat. With Miss Trelawny's {{permission}} he placed this in the boudoir; and Silvio was brought close to it. To the surprise of us all, however, except perhaps Doctor Winchester, he did not manifest the least annoyance; he took no notice of it whatever. He stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> close <b>beside</b> it, purring loudly. Then, following out his plan, the Doctor brought him into Mr. Trelawny's room, we all following. Doctor Winchester was excited; Miss Trelawny anxious. I was more than interested myself, for I began to have a glimmering of the Doctor's idea. The Detective was calmly and coldly superior; but Mr. Corbeck, who was an enthusiast, was full of eager curiosity.|$|R
60|$|Bob, {{though he}} did not know whence Anne's command {{proceeded}} obeyed with alacrity, pulled the box from the two relatives, and placed it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Villain!" [...] said Leicester, {{starting}} {{up on his}} couch, and seizing the sword which lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, [...] "go thy thoughts that way?--thou wouldst not do murder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The burglar, as if absently, took a large {{revolver}} {{from his}} pocket and laid it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> the decanter, but still kept his blue reflective eyes fixed on my face.|$|E
50|$|After the funeral, John realizes {{his mother}} did not leave; he finds her {{unconscious}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> embalming <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> Crowley, who demands John return Grant's body. John pretends to agree but knocks out Crowley. After April regains consciousness, they hook Crowley up to the embalming device. When Crowley wakes, the lights flicker, and a large, black, oily monster slides out of his body. Realizing {{he can no longer}} be with Kay, he asks John to watch over her and commits suicide. Both Crowley and the monster's corpses melt into black oil. Afterwards, the police find Grant's body, and Crowley is reported missing. John comforts Kay, who tells him the story of how she and Bill fell in love, making John realize he must find happiness, too. John and his mother later have a casual conversation as they embalm Grant's body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went into}} the study, and found him sitting close by the fire with {{his head down and}} his hands on his knees. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> near him, <b>beside</b> Armadale's letter and my note, I saw, in the little circle of light thrown by the reading-lamp, an open railway guide. Was he meditating flight? It was {{impossible}} to tell from his face, when he looked up at me, what he was meditating, or how the shock had struck him when he first discovered that Armadale was a living man.|$|R
60|$|A {{fortnight}} {{had passed}} away, {{and the special}} boat which had been placed {{at the disposal of}} the rescued tourists was already far north of Assiout. Next morning they would find themselves at Baliani, where one takes the express for Cairo. It was, therefore, their last evening together. Mrs. Shlesinger and her child, who had escaped unhurt, had already been sent down from the frontier. Miss Adams had been very ill after her privations, and {{this was the first time}} that she had been allowed to come upon deck after dinner. She sat now in a lounge chair, thinner, sterner, and kindlier than ever, while Sadie stood beside her and tucked the rugs around her shoulders. Mr. Stephens was carrying over the coffee and placing it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wicker <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> them. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other side of the deck Belmont and his wife were seated together in silent sympathy and contentment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's so," [...] I agreed. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> the bed {{in company}} {{with two or three}} other volumes, lay a Bible. He seemed to notice that my eye fell upon it.|$|E
60|$|He was alone. He glanced {{with a grin}} of {{comprehension}} from me to the letter, advanced, set his hat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> it, and his gloves (after blowing into them) beside his hat.|$|E
60|$|When these arrived Mr. Goodenough asked Frank {{to leave}} him alone with them. A {{quarter of an hour}} later they went out, and Frank, returning, found two sealed {{envelopes}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} {{following the}} events recorded, a girl was dressing in the ground-floor room of Number Nine, Daubeny Street. A tray bearing {{the remains of}} a late breakfast stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rickety <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> a bowl of wax flowers. From beneath <b>the</b> <b>table</b> peered <b>the</b> green cover of a copy of Variety. A grey parrot in a cage by the window cracked seed and looked out into the room with a satirical eye. He had seen all this so many times before--Nelly Bryant arraying herself in her smartest clothes to go out and besiege agents in their offices off the Strand. It happened every day. In an hour or two she would come back as usual, say [...] "Oh, Gee!" [...] in a tired sort of voice, and then Bill the parrot's day proper would begin. He was a bird who liked the sound of his own voice, and he never got the chance of a really sustained conversation till Nelly returned in the evening.|$|R
60|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{of the room was}} of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable. This might partly be {{due to the fact that}} a lamp stood flaring and smoking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centre <b>table.</b> <b>Beside</b> it sat <b>the</b> dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.|$|R
60|$|Directly I {{came into}} the room I {{appreciated}} the change in outlook that the achievement of Tono-Bungay had made almost as vividly as when I saw my uncle's new hat. The furniture of the room struck upon my eye as almost stately. The chairs and sofa were covered with chintz which gave it a dim, remote flavour of Bladesover; the mantel, the cornice, the gas pendant were larger and finer than the sort of thing I had grown accustomed to in London. And I was shown in by a real housemaid with real tails to her cap, and great quantities of reddish hair. There was my aunt too looking bright and pretty, in a blue-patterned tea-wrap with bows that seemed to me the quintessence of fashion. She was sitting in a chair by the open window with quite a pile of yellow-labelled books <b>on</b> <b>the</b> occasional <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her. Before <b>the</b> large, paper-decorated fireplace stood a three-tiered cake-stand displaying assorted cakes, and a tray with all the tea equipage except <b>the</b> teapot, was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large centre-table. The carpet was thick, and a spice of adventure was given it by a number of dyed sheep-skin mats.|$|R
