5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. <b>One</b> <b>mistake</b> that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E

500|$|When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992, they {{recruited}} {{a full-time}} replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph. Bostaph made <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> {{out of the}} nine songs the band trialled him with, on [...] "Angel of Death". Before the [...] "big double bass part" [...] there is a lead section, which Bostaph could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. Bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members told him there were eight, [...] "perfecting" [...] the song afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary role reversal for Mulder and Scully. When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence at the crime scenes, Scully points out that [...] "a crime is only as perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not <b>one</b> <b>mistake,</b> there still is a motive. If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E
500|$|During Blacklist development, its team faced {{a variety}} of challenges. The first was to create stealth which was {{satisfying}} and fun for players. According to the team, players gain satisfaction from stealth with freedom and choices which allow them to develop a plan. Players must experiment, with each decision having consequences. Game director Patrick Redding compared it {{to the development of}} an ecosystem; the team designed a dynamic artificial intelligence which would react differently to players' actions, making levels feel alive and adding randomness. Encouraging the [...] "panther" [...] style of play (aggressive stealth), the team incorporated elements from the original Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (where <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> would abort a mission) and Conviction (where stealth seamlessly becomes combat). This approach, the team thought, could help players to feel like elite, silent predators.|$|E

[...] Joe himself is becoming careless due to the distractions; <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> is caught by his nurse, Emily, who greatly admires the physician Joe could be ("The Gentleman Is a Dope"). [...] Denby congratulates Joe on his skills, both medical and social. [...] The elder doctor has less time for a nurse, Carrie Middleton, who has worked at his hospital for thirty years and once dated him, but who is involved in a labor protest—Denby orders her fired at the request of Lansdale, an influential trustee and soap manufacturer.

500|$|Science-fiction author John Peel, in his episode {{guide to}} the Supermarionation productions, labels The Secret Service [...] "dismal", {{describing}} the combination of puppetry and live action as [...] "completely pointless" [...] and Unwin's recruitment not only [...] "bizarre in the extreme" [...] but also ill-considered, in his opinion that Unwinese [...] "was hardly funny to most people (let alone children)." [...] Addressing Lew Grade's concerns that American audiences would have been left baffled by Unwin's mannerisms, {{he argues that the}} character was equally incomprehensible to UK viewers. As with La Rivière, Peel considers the central premise uninspired, writing that the Minimiser was the [...] "single gimmick" [...] of the series, which as a whole [...] "marked the death knell of Supermarionation." [...] It is his opinion that every Supermarionation series after Thunderbirds [...] "had made <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> after another", such that [...] "From the heights of Thunderbirds, the Anderson team had slipped to the depths with The Secret Service." ...|$|E
500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much – apart from <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Green Lumber Fallacy {{refers to}} a kind of fallacy where <b>one</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>one</b> {{important}} kind of knowledge for another; in other words, [...] "mistaking the source of important or even necessary knowledge, for another less visible from the outside, less tractable one... how many things we call 'relevant knowledge' aren’t so much so". Mathematically, it is the use of an incorrect function that, by chance, returns the correct output, such that one conflates g (x) with f (x). The root of the fallacy is that although people may be focusing on the right things, due to complexity of the thing, they are not good enough to figure it out intellectually.|$|R
500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out there and try to do it on foot, but if you make <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> and go five minutes out of your way, you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, DNA polymerases {{are highly}} accurate, with an {{intrinsic}} error rate {{of less than}} <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> for every 107 nucleotides added. [...] In addition, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides {{from the end of}} a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases. Finally, post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor the DNA for errors, being capable of distinguishing mismatches in the newly synthesized DNA strand from the original strand sequence. Together, these three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity of less than <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> for every 109 nucleotides added.|$|E

[...] After the EGM, John Delaney described FIFA as the [...] "biggest losers" [...] in the controversy for having [...] "made <b>one</b> <b>mistake</b> after another", referring to the mid-competition change in seeding rules for the play-off, the negative imagery of football as a whole generated by FIFA's actions and Henry's goal, and Sepp Blatter's subsequent dealings with the FAI.|$|E

When they finally returned Verne to 1900, H.G. Wells happened to go back to the site of his discussion with Verne, and therefore saw all that went on with the Timekeeper. Wells was flabbergasted, and Verne and Nine-Eye exchanged goodbyes as Wells struggled to understand what just happened. Nine-Eye returned to the present time, and now that guests had witnessed a [...] "flawless" [...] demonstration of his Time Machine, Timekeeper decided to send Nine-Eye into the future along with a few guests that volunteered to travel with her.|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter {{edited the}} film using the {{pseudonym}} John T. Chance, {{the name of}} John Wayne's character in Rio Bravo. Debra Hill acted as an uncredited assistant editor. According to Carpenter, the editing process was very bare bones. <b>One</b> <b>mistake</b> Carpenter was not proud of was one shot [...] "cut out of frame," [...] which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it. Assault was shot on Panavision, which takes up the entire negative, and edited on Moviola, which cannot show the whole image, so if a cut was made improperly (i.e., frame line not lined up properly) then one would cut a half of a sprocket into the film and [...] "cut out of frame," [...] as happened to Carpenter.

In the end, according to Christie's husband Max Mallowan, [...] "Agatha herself has always been allergic to the adaptation of her books by the cinema, but was persuaded to give a rather grudging appreciation to this one." [...] Christie's biographer Gwen Robyns quoted her as saying, [...] "It was well made except for <b>one</b> <b>mistake.</b> It was Albert Finney, as my detective Hercule Poirot.
