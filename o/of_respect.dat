5|$|As a mark <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> QPR {{postponed}} their upcoming {{game with}} Burnley, a team {{who in turn}} replaced it with an open training session with proceeds going to the charity of QPR's choice. QPR also decided to retire the number 31 shirt in memory of Jones, who wore that shirt during his career. In their league game against Southampton on 1 September 2007, all of the QPR players carried Jones' name {{on the back of}} their shirts as a mark <b>of</b> <b>respect.</b> Ten days later, in the England U19 friendly against Belarus at Meadow Lane in Nottingham, a minute's applause was held before the match.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose, for example, that a respects b. This {{state of}} affairs seems to involve three things: a, b, and the {{relation}} <b>of</b> <b>respecting.</b> For the {{state of affairs}} <b>of</b> a <b>respecting</b> b to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (a, b, and the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting)</b> exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might say, is that a and b [...] "stand in" [...] the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting.</b> But now {{we seem to have}} another state of affairs: the state of affairs of a and b standing in the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting.</b> This state <b>of</b> affairs in turn seems to involve four things: a, b, the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting,</b> and the relation of standing in. Again, however, for it to be the case that a and b stand in the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting,</b> it doesn't suffice that these four items exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might now say, is that a, b, and the relation <b>of</b> <b>respecting</b> stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, ad infinitum.|$|R

5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River.

5|$|As a token <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E

A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide.
