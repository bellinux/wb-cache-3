40|$|It is {{observed}} that the limited memory space of directmapped caches is not used in balance therefore incurs extra conflict misses. We propose a novel cache organization of a balanced cache, which balances accesses to cache sets at <b>the</b> granularity <b>of</b> cache subarrays. <b>The</b> key technique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balanced cache is a programmable subarray decoder through which <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> memory reference addresses to cache subarrays can be optimized hence conflict misses of direct-mapped caches can be resolved. The experimental results show that <b>the</b> miss rate <b>of</b> balanced cache is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> two-way set-associative caches on average and can be as low as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sized</b> four-way set-associative caches for particular applications.

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size.</b> Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|E

5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size</b> and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size.</b> Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>size,</b> possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E
