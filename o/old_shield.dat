2500|$|With {{the crisis}} concluded, the Hulk {{contacted}} Doctor Doom for help separating him and Banner for good {{in return for}} an unspecified favour. Doom proceeded to perform brain surgery on the Hulk, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner. When Doctor Doom demands to keep Banner for his own purposes, the Hulk reneges on the deal and flees with Banner's body, leaving his alter ego in the desert where he was created to ensure that Doctor Doom cannot use Banner's intellect. When Banner goes insane due to his separation from the Hulk, irradiating an entire tropical island trying to recreate his transformation- something he cannot do as the cloned body lacks the genetic elements of Banner {{that allowed him to}} process the gamma radiation- the Hulk is forced to destroy his other side by letting him be disintegrated by a gamma bomb, prompting the Hulk to accuse Doom of tampering with Banner's mind, only for Doom to observe that what was witnessed was simply Banner without the Hulk to use as a scapegoat for his problems. Initially assuming that Banner is dead, the Hulk soon realizes that Banner was somehow [...] "re-combined" [...] with him when the gamma bomb disintegrated Banner's body, resulting in the Hulk finding himself waking up in various strange locations, including helping the Punisher confront a drug cartel run by a mutated dog, hunting sasquatches with Kraven the Hunter, and being forced to face Wolverine and the Thing in an <b>old</b> <b>SHIELD</b> base. Banner eventually leaves a video message for the Hulk in which he apologizes for his actions while they were separate, having come to recognize that he is a better person with the Hulk than without, the two joining forces to thwart the Doombots' attempt to use the animals on Banner's irradiated island as the basis for a new gamma army using a one-of-a-kind gamma cure Banner had created to turn all the animals back to normal. Following this, Bruce willingly joined the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D., allowing them to use the Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself.|$|E

60|$|The white vapour lay, as {{it often}} does, in lean and palpable layers; {{and even the}} head of the tree was above it in the half-daylight, like a green ship {{swinging}} on a sea of foam. But higher yet behind them, and readier to catch the first coming of the sun, ran the rampart of the top of the wall, which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable, like the wall of heaven. Here, however, it was MacIan's turn to have the advantage; for, though less light-limbed and feline, he was longer and stronger in the arms. In two seconds he had tugged up his chin over the wall like a horizontal bar; the next he sat astride of it, like a horse of stone. With his assistance Turnbull vaulted to the same perch, and the two began cautiously to shift along the wall in the direction by which they had come, doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit. MacIan could not rid himself of the fancy of bestriding a steed; the long, grey coping of the wall shot out in front of him, like the long, grey neck of some nightmare Rosinante. He had the quaint thought that he and Turnbull were two knights on one steed on the <b>old</b> <b>shield</b> of the Templars.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} of long-wavelength gravity anomalies in northern Eurasia with seismic velocity anomalies {{in the upper}} mantle reverses in sign between western and eastern Eurasia. The difference between western and eastern Eurasia {{can be explained by}} the presence of a low-viscosity zone in the uppermost mantle beneath eastern Eurasia that is absent to the west. The location of the lateral change in viscosity corresponds with the geologic boundary between the <b>older</b> <b>shields</b> and platforms of the Baltics, Russia, and Siberia and the younger, geologically active mountain belts of eastern Asia.

50|$|Generally {{speaking}} Walker is an {{area between}} Welbeck Road and {{the banks of the}} River Tyne, although the modern city ward of Walker incorporates Pottery Bank and St Anthony's. When most Geordies refer to Walker they also incorporate the areas of Daisy Hill and Eastfield. Walkergate, located between Welbeck Road and the Network rail line are sometimes considered parts of Walker. Other parts of Walker are Walkerdene (which is along <b>Old</b> <b>Shields</b> Road going towards Wallsend) and Walkerville (which is located under the railway bridge and to the right, these houses are mainly private stock where as other areas of Walker are council and ex-council stock). Other areas included are Daisy Hill and Eastfield which help make up the city Ward of Walkergate.|$|R
40|$|Four {{kinds of}} Martian volcanoes and their prevalences in the cratered terrain {{hemisphere}} (generally the southern hemisphere) are described. Patera, which are large low-profile volcanic structures, {{appear to be}} either <b>older</b> <b>shield</b> volcanoes or a unique type of volcano. 'Plains' volcanics represent low-volume eruptions that formed cones, low shields, and other small-scale structures. Flood volcanics are produced by high-volume eruptions, post-date the older and more degraded plateau plains, and occur mostly as basin-fill materials. Plateau plains, the Martian intercrater plains, contain many wrinkle ridges and floor-fractured craters. It is suggested that volcanic processes as well as erosional processes have been important in obliterating small Martian craters and that volcanic products may constitute a significant fraction (up to 44 %) of the surface rocks in the cratered terrai...|$|R
5000|$|South Sister, {{also known}} as [...] "Charity," [...] is the {{youngest}} and tallest volcano of the trio. The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a stratovolcano overlying an <b>older</b> <b>shield</b> structure, no more than 50,000 years old, and last erupted about 2,000 years ago. The first such episode, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread tephra from flank vents {{from the south and}} southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. The second cycle, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle, was similar in result, but was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from about 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side.|$|R
