5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes all areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{a similar}} note, both {{countries}} {{would continue to}} conceal any war crimes committed by the other side {{for the remainder of}} the war. The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public. An example would be the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in Nanking in 1937, which were denounced by German industrialist John Rabe. Subsequently, the German leadership ordered Rabe back to Berlin, confiscating all his reports and prohibiting any further discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b>|$|E

5|$|Slavery by Another Name {{began as}} an article which Blackmon wrote for The Wall Street Journal {{detailing}} the use of black forced labor by U.S. Steel Corporation. Seeing the popular response to the article, he began conducting research for a more comprehensive exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> The resulting book was well received by critics and became a New York Times Best Seller. In 2009, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. In 2012, it was adapted as a documentary film for PBS, also titled Slavery by Another Name.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha Upanishad, in Chapter 4, {{states that}} {{individuals}} gain knowledge through seven stages: First, one must have virtuous desire to learn, discover (Subh-echchha). The second stage is inquiry, investigation (Vichārana). Discernment and thinning of mind toward other objects (Tanumanasi) {{is the third}} stage, states the text. The fourth stage is harmony, creative union with the subject of knowledge (Sattva-patti). Detachment from everything else (Asamsakti) is the fifth stage. Conceptual analysis and gaining complete, correct meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> (Pad-artha-bhavana) is the sixth stage. The seventh or last stage is Turiya, complete consciousness.|$|E
5|$|To further {{provide the}} fair and {{balanced}} view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic,</b> script editor Karen Wilson furthered her research by consulting with a Muslim advisor throughout the scripting and filming stages, as well as consulting the Muslims who played extras in the episode. Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand, {{it was the first}} time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline, and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes. It was also based on real life instances, something that Brenton considered a hallmark of the series, as many episodes are based on such events. News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode's broadcast, and the producers believed it justified the episode. The ending was written to be melancholic, in which there were no winners.|$|E

5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an in-depth study of the foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of five chapters, {{from which the}} five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses {{on the effects of}} international finance institutions' conditional loans since the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Between 1870 and 1890 {{a theory}} {{purporting}} that an atom was a vortex in the ether was immensely popular among British physicists and mathematicians. About 60 scientific papers {{were written by}} around 25 scientists. Following the lead of Thomson and Tait, the branch of topology called knot theory was developed. Kelvin's initiative in this complex study that continues to inspire new mathematics has led to persistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> in history of science.|$|E
25|$|In statistics, linear {{least squares}} {{problems}} correspond to a particularly important type of statistical model called linear regression which arises as a {{particular form of}} regression analysis.

25|$|The plot of Thunderstorm {{centers on}} one family's {{psychological}} and physical destruction {{as a result of}} incest, as perpetrated at the hands of its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan. Although it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by Thunderstorm was {{due in large part to}} its scandalous public airing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> of incest, and many people have pointed out technical imperfections in its structure, Thunderstorm is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China's modern theatrical ascendancy. Even those who have questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C. T. Hsia, admit that the popularization and consolidation of China's theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{government}} initially issued categorical denials of {{any involvement}} in the U.S. presidential election. Already in June 2016, {{in a statement to}} Reuters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any connection of Russian government bodies to the DNC hacks that had been blamed on Russia. When a new intelligence report surfaced in December 2016, Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister of Russia, rejected the accusations again. When ABC News wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved in the covert operation, Peskov called this report garbage. On December 16, 2016, Peskov called on the U.S. government to cease discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> unless they provide evidence to back up their assertions. According to The New Yorker, a pro-Kremlin MP justified the Russian attacks as a possible counterpunch to U.S. interference in foreign elections via color revolutions.|$|E
25|$|Discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> {{dates back}} to the American Civil War. A letter to the War Department dated 5 April 1862 from New York City {{resident}} John Doughty proposed the use of chlorine shells to drive the Confederate Army from its positions. Doughty included a detailed drawing of the shell with his letter. It is unknown how the military reacted to Doughty's proposal but the letter was unnoticed in a pile of old official documents until modern times. Another American, Forrest Shepherd, also proposed a chemical weapon attack against the Confederates. Shepherd's proposal involved hydrogen chloride, an attack that would have likely been non-lethal but may have succeeded in driving enemy soldiers from their positions. Shepherd was a well-known geologist at the time and his proposal was {{in the form of a}} letter directly to the White House.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the {{principal}} {{author of two}} U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, Rollin was regularly asked to prove animals are conscious and provide scientifically acceptable grounds for claiming they feel pain. Academic reviews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> are equivocal, noting that the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, but some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. A refereed journal Animal Sentience launched in 2015 by the Institute of Science and Policy of The Humane Society of the United States is devoted to research on this and related topics.|$|E
