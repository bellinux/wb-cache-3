5|$|Before {{and during}} the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) Drigung Monastery was looted of almost all its {{collection}} of statues, stupas, thangkas, manuscripts and <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> apart from a few small statues that the monks managed to hide. The buildings were severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Cast shadows {{give away}} even well-camouflaged animals. Many animals {{therefore}} {{take care to}} minimise shadow, by lying down, with flattened bodies, or with fringes. Some hawkmoth caterpillars have false shadow patterns to suggest they are parts of <b>other</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E
5|$|She began {{purchasing}} {{art objects}} {{with the intention}} of sending them to America, so that people that were not afforded the luxury of traveling to Europe could view good works of art.

50|$|A dope vector reduces these {{problems}} by storing {{a small amount}} of metadata along with an array (or <b>other</b> <b>object).</b> With dope vectors, a compiler can easily (and optionally) insert code that prevents accidentally writing beyond the end of an array or <b>other</b> <b>object.</b> Alternatively, the programmer can access the dope vector when desired, for safety or other purposes.|$|R

5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from <b>other</b> <b>objects,</b> and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E
5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E

5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> which {{may serve to}} spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Billie Nipper (November 22, 1929 – February 24, 2016) was an American {{artist who}} {{specialized}} in painting portraits of horses. Nipper, a native of Cleveland, Tennessee, painted every horse to win the Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship from 1976 until her death. Besides Tennessee Walking Horses, she painted other breeds of horse, as well as landscapes. Her paintings were made into prints and transferred onto china and <b>other</b> <b>objects.</b> Nipper also bred horses, and her husband and son were horse trainers.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda, Sif {{is named}} {{as the mother}} of the goddess Þrúðr by Thor and of Ullr with a father whose name is not recorded. The Prose Edda also recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden {{headpiece}} made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> for other gods.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and <b>other</b> <b>objects,</b> while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E

5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce {{three categories of}} sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks {{are believed to be}} used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It {{can be difficult to}} control because it grows fast and spreads over <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> in the tank.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most <b>other</b> <b>objects,</b> orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
