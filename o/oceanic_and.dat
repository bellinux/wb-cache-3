5|$|On May21, 2007, the National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity.

Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI.

5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (<b>oceanic)</b> <b>and</b> freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E
