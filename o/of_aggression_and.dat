Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make}} the differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

5|$|Speer {{was taken}} to several {{internment}} centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September1945, {{he was told that}} he would be tried for war crimes, and several days later, he {{was taken to}} Nuremberg and incarcerated there.

These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military prison at Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt the death sentence was warranted.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and the national anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.|$|E

5|$|The {{first serious}} combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant act <b>of</b> <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft, and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared that the events were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} negative impacts on nonhuman primates and tourists at various primate tourism sites and advocate the improvement of tourism management. Yet, it remains unclear what constitutes good quality management. We explored whether rates <b>of</b> macaque <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> stress levels differed under supervision of different park rangers at Valley of the Wild Monkeys (VWM) in Anhui Province, China. We hypothesized that lower levels <b>of</b> macaque <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> self-directed behaviors (SDBs) would be observed if park rangers enforced park rules. Behaviors of tourists, park rangers, and monkeys were collected from August 16 to September 30, 2012. Rates <b>of</b> macaque <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> SDBs were compared across different park rangers. At VWM, two pairs of park rangers interchangeably provisioned a group of macaques on a monthly basis. Our results showed that rates <b>of</b> monkey <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> stress-related behaviors {{did not differ significantly}} among different park ranger conditions. We compared the first and second week rates <b>of</b> macaque <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> stress-related behaviors post-alternation of park rangers for August and September. Our results showed that rates <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> were not significantly different during two weeks post-alteration for both August and September, but rates of SDBs were significantly different between first and second weeks in August. Park rangers restricted tourists from interacting with the monkeys on only 8 out of 81 (9. 9 percent) visiting sessions, which suggests that rangers’ interventions during tourist interactions with macaques occurred infrequently at VWM...|$|R

40|$|Homosexual {{males are}} {{reported}} to be less physically aggressive than heterosexual males (Ellis, Hoffman, & Burke, 1990; Gladue & Bailey, 1995). Previous aggression studies have not, however, compared all forms <b>of</b> direct <b>aggression,</b> indirect <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> empathy among these populations. Empathy is a significant factor to consider since it both mitigates the expression <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> (Kaukiainen, Björkqvist, Lagerspetz, Österman, Salmivalli, Rothberg, & Ahlbom, 1998) and differs between heterosexual and homosexual males (Salais & Fischer, 1995). This study therefore evaluated levels <b>of</b> direct <b>and</b> indirect <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> empathy among homosexual (n = 91) and heterosexual (n = 91) males. Data was collected from an Internet-based sample {{of the two groups}} using self-report psychometric measures in order to reduce social desirability effects.

Adult mice with low baseline levels of corticosterone are more likely to become dominant than are mice with high baseline corticosterone levels.|$|E

25|$|Stimulation of the {{amygdala}} results in augmented aggressive behavior in hamsters, while lesions of an evolutionarily homologous {{area in the}} lizard greatly reduce competitive drive and aggression (Bauman et al. 2006). In rhesus monkeys, neonatal lesions in {{the amygdala}} or hippocampus results in reduced expression of social dominance, related to the regulation <b>of</b> <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> fear. Several experiments in attack-primed Syrian golden hamsters, for example, support the claim of circuity within the amygdala being involved in control of aggression. The role of the amygdala is less clear in primates and appears to depend more on situational context, with lesions leading to increases in either social affiliatory or aggressive responses.|$|E
