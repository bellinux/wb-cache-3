40|$|A healthy work-to-rest ratio during {{computer}} {{work can}} be an important part of successful preventive workrelated upper limb disorders (WRULD) intervention. Existing break software applications designed to realise such a work-to-rest ratio often possess product features that limit their functionality. Most applications focus on physical relaxation by implementing (micro) breaks into computer work time. Through the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>break</b> <b>time,</b> these applications give the impression that there is no productivity, possibly strengthened by the applications themselves that often visualise the remainder of the break as a slowly decreasing time bar. Moreover, application features such as blocking input devices may counteract cognitive relaxation of computer workers. As imposed physical breaks can be cognitively stressful, especially when deadlines loom, combining physical and cognitive relaxation is a challenge. Actually, research shows that, instead of micro breaks, macro breaks need more attention. It is worthwhile to think of new products for both forms of relaxation within this time span. An idea for a possible product innovation is tested with a small sample and is presented here: a new software application that shows customisable video content during macro breaks.

40|$|The {{promotion}} {{of physical activity}} to young people is currently a public health priority due to growing concerns that this group is not sufficiently physically active. Adolescence in particular is characterised with a decline in physical activity levels (Verstraete, et al 2006, Journal of Public Health, 16 : 415 - 419). There exists an increased concern that Physical Education lessons within the National School Curriculum do not assist with this downward trend in activity levels, thus the notion of using school break time to promote physical activity is being explored (Ridgers, et al 2006, Sports Medicine, 36 : 359 - 371). Whilst research has been completed into the use of break time physical activity interventions within primary schools, there is a distinct shortage of work examining the effectiveness of interventions aimed at the adolescent population. The {{aim of this study}} was to hence establish if a physical activity intervention delivered in school break time could increase the physical activity levels of adolescents from one secondary school in Lincoln. Emphasis was placed upon evaluating the intervention in order to establish its effectiveness and not merely reporting statistical findings. The research was situated within the critical realist paradigm adopting a subjective epistemology. Following institutional ethics approval, one secondary school was chosen as the case study location. Observations recording adolescents’ physical activity levels were completed during lunch break twice per week for a period of five weeks using the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY). The first two weeks featured no physical activity intervention, whilst the final three weeks involved the provision of games equipment. Structured interviews were completed with adolescents to gain a deeper understanding of the influence and effect of the intervention on physical activity levels. Both data sets were then incorporated to evaluate the effect of the intervention under the RE-AIM Evaluation Framework (Glasgow, et al 1999, American Journal of Public Health, 89 : 1322 - 1327). Findings illustrated that the intervention had no significant impact <b>on</b> <b>break</b> <b>time</b> physical activity levels and that physical activity was limited due to institutional constraints placed by the school. Restraints related to the time available at break time which reduced activity opportunities, especially when considering the time adolescents required to leave and return to lessons. The study thus suggests that it is the school environment as opposed to the activity available which influences adolescents’ physical activity levels at break time...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} optical isolator based <b>on</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>time</b> reversal symmetry in dissipative finite Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) waveguide arrays that support topological edge states {{at one end of the}} structure. In the forward propagation direction, light is launched into the edge waveguide to excite the localized topological midgap state. As a result, most of the input optical power is trans-mitted to the output port. On the other hand, backward reflected light encounters a propagation constant mismatch in that same channel which shifts the otherwise midgap state into one of the bands and hence becomes delocalized over the whole array. We show that under these conditions, a judicious spatial distribution of the optical dissipation across the structure can produce an isolation ratio of − 50 dB. The required nonreciprocal phase shift is intro-duced by depositing a magnetic garnet film only on the edge waveguide and, thus, the required magnetic field can be generated by an integrated micromagnet.

In order to understand the impact of changes and redesigns on work behaviors, analysis of the nursing unit culture must be done. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess cultural norms and behaviors of the staff at the nursing unit level. The conceptual framework for this study is the General Systems theory. The population (N= 200) will be registered nurses and licensed practical nurses on eight inpatient nursing units representing medical-surgical nursing at one hospital. The anticipated sample will be between 75100 participants. After identifying the nurse managers, sending a letter explaining the purpose of the study, and a copy of the tool, staff will be asked to participate in the study. The participants will be asked to complete the Nursing Unit Cultural Assessment Tool (NUCAT), which assesses 50 cultural behaviors found to be valid indicators of behaviors that are important to practicing nurses and that differ between nursing units. Demographic data will also be collected. A cover letter explaining the study will be given to all regularly scheduled, inpatient, medical-surgical nursing personnel.

According to the conservation of resources theory (CORT) human energy {{can be seen as}} a battery that depletes during the day. An individual must take time off away from work to replenish their resources. For a break to result in recovery employees have to direct their time to activities that reduce the claim on the personal resources and that allows the resources to be replenished. Research in the past 20 years has been focused on the effects of <b>breaks</b> from work <b>on</b> the energy of the employee. The different breaks from work that have been researched are: vacations, weekends, the end of the workday and breaks during the workday. Research about work breaks during the workday is limited compared to other forms of work <b>breaks.</b> The researches <b>on</b> <b>breaks</b> during work <b>time</b> have different conclusions about the effects of breaks during the workday on the vitality of the employee. This results in the aim of this research: “Gain insight in the effects of work related breaks and micro <b>breaks</b> <b>on</b> the vitality en fatigue of the employee”.

40|$|Conventional clonal avocado {{rootstock}} propagation {{relies on}} a 40 year old method and derivatives thereof that is labour intensive and does not facilitate cost effective supply of clonal rootstocks for the rapidly developing needs of the industry. This is especially relevant if high density plantings or clonal rootstocks are to be adopted. An alternative tissue-culture-based clonal propagation system could provide efficient, cost effective, high volume and sterile production of clonal rootstocks. Avocado, being a woody plant species, is not highly amenable to tissue culture, with most attempts confined to nodal culture methods. Thus far, nodal cultures of avocado show very slow growth and produce stunted shoots, limiting rapid shoot multiplication. The current study aims to develop a system to multiply nodal avocado shoots using gibberellins and cytokinins to produce taller shoots with a higher number of nodes for continuous culturing. Cytokinins, the most important plant growth regulator in shoot regeneration, and gibberellins, which promote internode elongation, can synergistically improve the quality shoots for rapid nodal multiplication.

40|$|Abstract Assessment of {{correlates}} {{of physical activity}} occurring {{at different times of}} the day, locations and contexts, is imperative to understanding children’s physical activity behaviour. The purpose of this review was to identify the {{correlates of}} children’s physical activity (aged 8 – 14 [*]years) occurring during the school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> and after-school periods. A review was conducted of the peer-reviewed literature, published between 1990 and January 2011. A total of 22 studies (12 school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> studies, 10 after-school studies) were included in the review. Across the 22 studies, 17 studies were cross-sectional and five studies were interventions. In the school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> studies, 39 potential correlates were identified, of which gender and age were consistently associated with school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> physical activity in two or more studies, and family affluence, access to a gym, access to four or more physical activity programs and the condition of a playing field were all associated with school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> physical activity in only one study. Access to loose and fixed equipment, playground markings, size of and access to play space and the length of school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> were all positively associated with changes in school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> physical activity in intervention studies. Thirty-six potential correlates of after-school physical activity were identified. Gender (with boys more active), younger age, lower body mass index (for females), lower TV viewing/playing video games, and greater access to facilities were associated with higher levels of after-school physical activity in two or more studies. Parent supervision was negatively associated with females’ after-school physical activity in one study. This review has revealed {{a relatively small number of}} studies investigating the school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> and after-school periods in the specified age range and only a few correlates have demonstrated a consistent association with physical activity. This highlights the infancy of this area and a need for further investigation into time-specific physical activity behaviour so that interventions designed for these specific periods can target the important correlates. </p...|$|R
