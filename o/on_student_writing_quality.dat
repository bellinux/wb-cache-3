40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigating}} {{the effectiveness of}} Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) ™ in a senior-level biochemistry class had three purposes: to (a) compare the CPR process for feedback with TA-generated feedback in improving students’ ability to write scientific abstracts; (b) compare CPR results for males and females; and (c) observe whether CPR improved the quality of student writing. Statistical analyses of three assignments by 50 students indicated significant differences between CPR and TA feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> In addition, while scores of students who received TA feedback decreased, scores of students who had CPR improved. Students also progressed in CPR-generated measures of their writing and reviewing abilities. A separate analysis including 256 students found {{no significant differences between}} males and females.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{experimental}} study aims {{to investigate the}} effect of different task variance that involves Providing Topic Sentence and Providing Signal Words as independent variables <b>on</b> <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency which covers complexity and coherence as dependent variables. Two groups {{of the first year}} students of English Department at Jambi University in Indonesia were selected as participants in this study. Each group consists of 30 students. Group I was required to perform the writing task that is provided topic sentence (PTS). Group II was required to perform the writing task that is provided signal words (PSW). The results of the test were rated or scored by using analytical and holistic rating systems. The data were analyzed statistically by using Independent Sample T – Test and Correlation. The findings of the study showed that on average, Group I has higher level of effect <b>on</b> <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency (M = 72. 57, SE = 1. 81) than the effect of Group II <b>on</b> <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency (M = 56. 50, SE = 2. 16). This difference is significant (t (58) = 5. 70; p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the interactions among the components of complexity have strong correlation. Then, positive relationships among the components of coherence are also statistically proved. Therefore, the null hypothesis which says that there is no effect of different task variance that involves Providing Topic Sentence and Providing Signal Words <b>on</b> <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency which covers complexity and coherence can be rejected. Based on these findings we conclude that Providing Topic Sentence helps students much better to develop paragraph writing than Providing Signal Words. ...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{feedback}} to written work {{is one of}} the most important and challenging aspects of teaching legal writing. Legal writing professors spend a great deal of time and energy critiquing and grading student work. However, few legal writing professionals begin teaching with any formal training on providing {{feedback to}} novice legal writers. Fortunately, giving useful comments <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> is a skill that can be learned. To begin, teachers must learn to prioritize feedback on the most important analytical problems on draft assignments. Focusing on analytical deficiencies helps students understand that substantive problems must be corrected before writing and stylistic problems can be effectively addressed. The best way to become proficient at prioritizing feedback is to understand the theory of analytical critique and consider a variety of critiquing methods. This article explores the theory of analytical critique and provides concrete suggestions on how to put the theory into practice when giving feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> After discussing the theory and methodology of analytical critique, the article provides a hand-on, workshop-type experience.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (English)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{research}} {{reported on}} in this thesis forms part of {{the foundation of a}} bigger research project in which an attempt is made to provide better, faster and more efficient feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> The introduction presents the localised and international context of the study, and discusses some of the problems experienced with feedback practice in general. The introduction also gives a preview of the intended practical implementation of the research reported {{on in this}} thesis. From there on, the thesis is presented in article form with each article investigating and answering a part of two main guiding questions. These questions are: 1. Does feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> work? 2. How can feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> be implemented as effectively as possible? The abstracts for the five individual articles are as follows: Article 1 Article 1 presents a rubric for the evaluation of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) software based on international recommendations for effective CALL. The rubric is presented after a brief overview of the pedagogical and implementation fundamentals of CALL, and a discussion of what needs to be included in a needs analysis for CALL evaluation. It is then illustrated how the evaluation criteria in the rubric can be used in the design of a new CALL system. Article 2 Providing feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> is a much-debated topic. One group of researchers argues that it is ineffective and another group remains convinced that it is effective, while at ground level teachers and lecturers simply carry on “marking” texts. The author of this article contends that both arguments have valid contributions to make and uses the arguments both for and against feedback to create a checklist for effective feedback practice. Adhering to this checklist should counter most of the arguments against feedback while supporting and improving the positive arguments in favour of feedback. Article 3 This article reports on an experiment which tested how effectively standardised feedback could be used when marking L 2 <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> The experiment was conducted using a custom-programmed software tool and a set of standardised feedback comments. The results of the experiment prove that standardised feedback can be used consistently and effectively to a degree, even though some refinements are still needed. Using standardised feedback in a standard marking environment can assist markers in raising their awareness of errors and in more accurately identifying where students lack knowledge. With some refinements, it may also be possible to speed up the marking process. Article 4 This article describes an experiment in which Boolean feedback (a kind of checklist) was used to provide feedback on the paragraph structures of first-year students in an academic literacy course. The major problems with feedback on L 2 writing are introduced and it is established why a focus on paragraph structures in particular is of importance. The experiment conducted was a two-draft assignment in which three different kinds of feedback (technique A: handwritten comments; technique B: consciousness raising through generalised Boolean feedback; and technique C: specific Boolean feedback) were presented to three different groups of students. The results indicate that specific Boolean feedback is more effective than the other two techniques, partly because a higher proportion of the instances of negative feedback on the first draft were corrected in the second draft (improvements), but more importantly because in the revision a much lower number of changes to the text resulted in negative feedback on the second draft (regressions). For non-specific feedback, almost as many regressions occurred as improvements. In combination with automatic analytical techniques made possible with software, the results from this study make a case for using such checklists to give feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> Article 5 This article describes an experiment in which a series of statements, answerable simply with yes or no (labelled Boolean feedback), were used to provide feedback on the introductions, conclusions and paragraph structures of student texts. A write-rewrite assignment (the same structure as in article 4) was used {{and the quality of the}} student revisions was evaluated. The results indicate that the students who received Boolean feedback showed greater improvement and fewer regressions than students who received feedback using the traditional method. The conclusion provides a brief summary as well as a preview of the immense future research possibilities made possible by this project. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been done {{worldwide}} to examine issues related to providing feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in different second language classrooms (e. g.

Bartels, 2003; Saito and Fujita, 2004; Hyland and Hyland, 2006; Yang et al, 2006; Villamil and De Guerrero, 2006) and self-feedback (Makino, 1993; Ferris, 2002). However, it could be inappropriate or at least questionable to use the same type of Written Feedback (WF) in dissimilar pedagogic and contextual settings. For this reason, mixed methods research (mixed research) was carried out to compare staff and students' perspectives, attitudes, experiences and understanding of issues related to WF in three English as a Foreign Language (EFL) secondary schools in Syria. In particular, this research set out to discover what type of feedback <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> dominates in the EFL Syrian secondary classroom, the reasons behind such dominance and how these students and staff view implementing types of feedback other than that/those dominant in that classroom. To reach this goal, six types of triangulation were utilised to enhance the validity and reliability of the research outcomes: data source, methodological, respondent, space, analysis and methodology triangulation.

40|$|This dissertation, {{consisting}} of one systematic review and two empirical studies, {{aims to examine}} the relationship between English vocabulary knowledge and English <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> with a sample of Chinese-speaking 8 th and 9 th graders. As the findings reveal, the vocabulary-writing relationship varies with dimensions of vocabulary knowledge. Specifically, vocabulary breadth consistently contributes to <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> across grades whereas vocabulary depth displays a stronger predictive power for <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> in the 9 th grade. Additionally, after-class English literacy experiences exert indirect effects on the 9 th graders? <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> through overall vocabulary knowledge. The systematic review of the current literature synthesizes the role of English vocabulary in English language learners? (ELLs) writing development. Though, overall, vocabulary breadth has a more prominent role than vocabulary depth in ELLs? <b>writing</b> <b>quality,</b> productive vocabulary depth may still significantly predict their writing performance. Learning contexts, students? English proficiency, scoring rubrics, and vocabulary measures are possible factors mediating the vocabulary-writing relationship. The first empirical study looks into the relationship between vocabulary breadth, vocabulary depth, and writing abilities with the 8 th and 9 th graders. Measures include tests of vocabulary size, word association, and morphological awareness, and English writing samples. Standard multiple regression analyses show that vocabulary breadth makes a bigger contribution to writing performance across grades. However, some aspect of vocabulary depth is only related to the 9 th graders? writing performance, suggesting a growing impact of vocabulary depth on writing development. Using the same sample of students, the second empirical study investigates: (1) the relative contribution of vocabulary knowledge, grammatical knowledge, and idea-generating ability to writing quality; (2) the impact of individual motivation and after-class English literacy experiences on <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> In addition to the measures utilized in the first empirical study, this study also utilizes a background questionnaire and tests of grammar and idea-generating ability. Path analyses identify overall vocabulary knowledge as the most prominent predictor of the <b>students?</b> <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> Furthermore, the 9 th graders? after-class literacy activities have a significant, yet indirect relationship with writing through vocabulary. Therefore, it is likely that the contribution from the literacy activities to ELLs? early writing development may be mediated by their language proficiency levels...|$|R

One of the frequently examined issues is the efficacy of feedback that has been actively discussed to date (Chandler, 2004; Ellis, 1998; Ferris, 1999; Truscott, 1996, 1999, 2004). The other concern is the effects of various types of feedback <b>on</b> accuracy of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> (Silva 2 ̆ 6 Brice, 2004). Despite {{the fact that a}} number of studies have been conducted on these issues in Indo-European languages, no clear conclusion has been drawn (Ferris, 2004). ^ Several studies investigated these issues in the JSL environment (e. g., Ishibashi, 2000; Sakai, 1999). However, the effects of feedback on accuracy of writing by novice and intermediate level JFL students have not been addressed. Considering the complicated writing system in Japanese, teacher feedback may have different impacts <b>on</b> JFL <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> comparing to Indo-European languages, which calls for further research to address this issue. ^ The present study investigates the efficacy and effects of various types of teacher feedback on writing by American university students enrolled in a third-semester Japanese course. Four types of feedback, (1) providing indications and corrections of errors, (2) indicating errors and giving codes of errors, (3) giving lists of revising criteria, and (4) no feedback (the control group), were randomly assigned to the subjects. Initially, 124 participants were asked to complete five composition tasks in l 5 weeks. For each task, they were required to revise their composition to improve the accuracy of their writing with the help of given feedback. Additionally, in order to investigate students 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 views concerning feedback on writing, two types of survey were administered. ^ The present study found that direct feedback is the most effective to improve <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> accuracy in a short-term period and that there is no significant difference in writing accuracy among the four groups in a long-term period.
