40|$|A {{very well}} {{established}} {{phenomenon in the}} judgment and decision making tradition is <b>the</b> <b>overconfidence</b> one places {{in the amount of}} knowledge that one possesses. A recent important finding is that knowledge calibration varies not only individually but across cultures as well.

Furthermore, research efforts attempting to explain cross-cultural variations in <b>the</b> <b>overconfidence</b> phenomenon have seldom been made. Most of the research conducted has focused on establishing that there is variation in this phenomenon across cultures. Thus, the mechanisms behind this effect remain elusive. Two studies were conducted to investigate whether <b>the</b> <b>overconfidence</b> effect generalizes to Mexican-American and Mexican participants and whether culture-related variables such as preference for quick decision making, holistic reasoning, and uncertainty orientation predict calibration indices. Results of two studies conducted on White American (N = 179), Mexican-American (N = 264), and Mexican participants (N = 164) corroborate the cross-cultural variation of probability judgment accuracy. Holistic reasoning fully mediated the association between intuitive decision-making and overconfidence. As in previous studies, White American participants displayed less overconfidence when compared to Mexican-American and Mexican participants. Results of study 2 indicated that a rapid feeling of knowing is not predictive of memory performance on participants with a greater predisposition to reason holistically. More research needs to be conducted to: (1) investigate the specific mechanism by which holistic reasoning exerts its effect, and (2) explain discrepant findings observed between patterns of results for <b>the</b> two <b>overconfidence</b> indices computed. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we analyze whether {{volatility}} forecasts (judgmental confidence intervals) {{are influenced}} by the specific elicitation mode (i. e. whether forecasters have to state future price levels or directly future returns as upper and lower bounds).

Participants were asked to state median forecasts as well as confidence intervals for seven stock market time series. Using a between subject design, one half of the subjects was asked to state future price levels, the other group was directly asked for returns. Consistent with prior research we find that subjects underestimate the volatility of stock returns, indicating overconfidence. As a new insight, we find that the strength of <b>the</b> <b>overconfidence</b> effect in stock market forecasts is highly significantly affected by the fact whether subjects provide price or return forecasts.
