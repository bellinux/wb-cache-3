Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of <b>our</b> <b>education</b> system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{basically}} {{argues that}} the many social problems {{that we are now}} faced are in fact product of the system of <b>our</b> religious <b>education.</b> The educational system of our Madrasas has not thus far shown its ability to address the spiritual needs of our students. This resulted in students absorbing the physical and at best the intellectual dimension of education by ignoring the moral and behavioral aspects of it. On this ground –the paper argues- the system of <b>our</b> religious <b>education</b> must be revisited and reevaluated. Such system must not only indoctrinate students to learn about heaven, hell, what is lawful and lawful, belief and infidelity and the like, but must also teach them about tolerance, understanding and other social values. <b>Our</b> religious <b>education</b> must teach students conceptual knowledge but also educate them about how to respect others and live in a plural society. It is about these that this paper is concerned with. It is about the scheme of religious education for pluralism or multiculturalism...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows {{us a great}} opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize <b>our</b> <b>education</b> system. In {{addition to}} the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the [...] "one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved {{over the course of the}} twentieth century." [...] In the chapter, [...] "Project Classroom Makeover," [...] Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.|$|E
