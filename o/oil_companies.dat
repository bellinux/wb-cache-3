5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major <b>oil</b> <b>companies,</b> such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974.

Foreign <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted.

Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri.
