Placing the series in Salt Lake City, the international headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is enough to blur the line between the modern Church and the program's subject matter, and to reinforce old and long-outdated stereotypes.

Over the next three semesters, however, the story veered from its original focus of mother-child separation to what Domalpalli later described as a study of [...] "elements of class distinction and conflict that continue to infuse <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> culture even today." [...] Referring to its emphasis, he said the film was also about [...] "fading institutions of folk art, old buildings that are collapsing, things which we should be protecting— which are a part of our heritage." [...] Speaking of the need for preservation of Indian culture and heritage, he said that making the film was an opportunity to emphasize the Indian folk arts, too.|$|E

(See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie <b>our</b> <b>society,</b> <b>and</b> wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E

40|$|Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby&# 039;s {{new book}} argues {{for the value}} of design {{projects}} that speculate about possible futures rather than just realize market-feasible futures. The claim is that <b>our</b> <b>societies,</b> <b>and</b> the industries responsible for furnishing <b>our</b> <b>societies</b> with products <b>and</b> environments, are losing the capacity to envision futures in order to evaluate their desirability. In response, Dunne and Raby, and the designers of which they approve, insist on the importance of speculations being physicalized beyond prototype but no longer (compared to their earlier "critical design" work) deployed for people to use.

500|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Sentient animals, Cochrane argues, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on the situation in question. Cochrane explores the consequences of the account in his Animal Rights Without Liberation, arguing that, with very few exceptions, nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing, animal agriculture, in entertainment, for environmental purposes and in cultural practices. Despite this, because Cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals, his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts. In a 2016 article, Cochrane extended his interest-based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals, on the basis that working animals are members of <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> workers. These rights include a right to representation in a union, a right to [...] "just and favourable remuneration", a right to safe and healthy conditions of work, and a right to time off from work.|$|E
500|$|Several critics theorized {{about the}} effects of the shift from {{scarcity}} to abundance of written material in the media {{as a result of the}} technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for its potential to lead individuals to a superficial comprehension of many subjects rather than a deep comprehension of just a few subjects. According to Shirky, an individual's ability to concentrate had been facilitated by the [...] "relatively empty environment" [...] which had ceased to exist when the wide availability of the web proliferated new media. Although Shirky acknowledged that the unprecedented quantity of written material available on the web might occasion a sacrifice of the cultural importance of many works, he believed that the solution was [...] "to help make the sacrifice worth it". In direct contrast, Sven Birkerts argued that [...] "some deep comprehension of our inheritance [...] essential", and called for [...] "some consensus vision among those shapers of what <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>and</b> culture might be shaped toward", warning against allowing the commercial marketplace to dictate the future standing of traditionally important cultural works. While Carr found solace in Shirky's conceit that [...] "new forms of expression" [...] might emerge to suit the Internet, he considered this conceit to be one of faith rather than reason. In a later response, Shirky continued to expound upon his theme that [...] "technologies that make writing abundant always require new social structures to accompany them", explaining that Gutenberg's printing press led to an abundance of cheap books which were met by [...] "a host of inventions large and small", such as the separation of fiction from non-fiction, the recognition of talents, the listing of concepts by indexes, and the practice of noting editions.|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} the work of a talented few, whose {{products}} are passed on to the masses. Here we argue that innovations are instead an emergent property of our species’ cultural learning abilities, applied within <b>our</b> <b>societies</b> <b>and</b> social networks. <b>Our</b> <b>societies</b> <b>and</b> social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination, and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (1) sociality, (2) transmission fidelity and (3) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other. For example, we provide preliminary evidence that transmission efficiency is affected by sociality—languages with more speakers are more efficient. We argue that collective brains can make each of their constituent cultural brains more innovative. This perspective sheds light on traits, such as IQ, that have been implicated in innovation. A collective brain perspective can help us understand otherwise puzzling findings in the IQ literature, including group differences, heritability differences, and the dramatic increase in IQ test scores over time...|$|R
