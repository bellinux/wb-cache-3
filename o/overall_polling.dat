40|$|This article recaps {{the main}} trends in public opinion and electoral support for the Conservative party since the last general {{election}} in June 2001 by examining the <b>overall</b> <b>polling</b> data relating to party popularity. The article also considers by-elections, local elections and leadership change, as well as the most recent elections in 2004. The various challenges the party faces as it attempts to position itself as a credible alternative government to the Labour party under Tony Blair are considered. Given the clear biases of the electoral system used for the House of Commons, which are certain to benefit Labour substantially even if the Conservatives get close to them in terms of overall vote share, or indeed even overtake them, it still seems unlikely that such success will be sufficient to achieve much more than to reduce Tony Blair's House of Commons majority in 2005...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a polling {{accuracy}} measure for multi-party elections {{based on a}} generalization of Martin, Traugott, and Kennedy’s two-party predictive accuracy index. Treating polls as random samples of a voting population, we first estimate an intercept only multinomial logit model to provide proportionate odds measures of each party’s share of the vote, and thereby both unweighted and weighted averages of these values as a summary index for poll accuracy. We then propose measures for significance testing, and run a series of simulations to assess possible bias from the resulting folded normal distribution across different sample sizes, finding that bias is small even for polls with small samples. We apply our measure to the 2012 French presidential election polls to demonstrate its applicability in tracking <b>overall</b> <b>polling</b> performance across time and polling organizations. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our measure by {{using it as a}} dependent variable in an explanatory model of polling accuracy, testing the different possible sources of bias in the French data. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyAlthough the American {{political}} system is often thought of as comprised of two parties, there are in fact often elections in which three or more parties are competing at the national level. In a national election with a Democratic, Republican and Independent candidate, voting often may be no longer about a preferred candidate or party, but instead about strategy. Perhaps {{one of the most}} important sources for strategic decision making in these elections is polling data. Given that polling data play a particular role in these elections, this research was conducted to examine just what role polling data play on Independent voting behavior in a three-party election. In this study, a preferred candidate was assigned and hypothetical polls with varied percentage points were used in an experimental design to determine how poll percentages affect the likelihood of voting for the preferred Independent candidate. To understand the decision making process, variations on the polling scenarios were utilized to examine the influence of the <b>overall</b> <b>poll</b> numbers, leading party, the percentage trend over time, as well as other demographic and cognitive items. The results suggested a significant relationship between the percentages for Independent candidates reported in polls and the likelihood of voting for him/her, regardless of gender, ethnicity, which major party candidate is leading in the polls and recent trends in the polling percentage of the candidate. While other relationships were found in the data to predict specific voting patterns, such as degree of partisanship affecting the likelihood of voting for an Independent candidate in any polling scenario, none significantly influenced the trend found as a result of the different percentage variations. The study demonstrated that, regardless of these variables, as poll numbers go up for the preferred Independent candidate, the likelihood of voters willing to vote for the candidate will also increase, confirming the hypothesis that polling data influence Independent voting behavio...|$|R
