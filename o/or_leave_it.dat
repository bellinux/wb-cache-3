25|$|Littoral {{cells are}} usually {{an area where}} changes in the volume of {{sediment}} directly affects changes in the coastline, and ideally they are defined to minimise longshore sediment exchange with other littoral cells, for example, a pocket beach surrounded by rocky headlands (which are presumed to exclude sediments). Sub-cells are usually defined to better measure the sediment budget of a coast with varying rates of accretion and erosion. The landward boundary of a littoral cell is usually {{the foot of a}} dune or cliff, however, the seaward boundary is difficult to define as mechanisms of sediment transport here are poorly understood. There are three kinds of boundaries between littoral cells: longshore, landward, and seaward; across which sediment may enter the littoral cell <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> by various processes. It is important to identify which processes operate on a particular littoral cell and also important to identify sediment sources and sinks, as by measuring the sediment gained or lost by these sources and sinks, a sediment budget can be determined.|$|E
25|$|The line a bowler {{chooses to}} bowl {{will depend on}} several factors: the {{movement}} he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic {{with the intention of}} dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw. It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips. Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.|$|E

500|$|In his {{survey of}} cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb {{suggests}} that [...] "no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; {{it has caused}} trouble from its earliest days". Among {{those who do not}} follow cricket, the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand, of equivalent complexity to association football's offside rule. Owing to the difficulty of its interpretation, lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a yardstick by which an umpire's abilities are judged. In his book Cricket and the Law: The Man in White Is Always Right, David Fraser writes that umpires' lbw decisions are frequently criticised and [...] "arguments about bias and incompetence in adjudication inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions". Problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred. Controversial aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump, and in certain circumstances whether the batsman intended to hit the ball <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> alone. Umpires are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players, commentators and spectators. Historically, trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions. For example, a prolonged crowd disturbance, in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed, took place when Mohammad Azharuddin was adjudged lbw during a 1996 One Day International in India.|$|E

He also said, [...] "Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind...and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath." [...] Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave {{a rating of}} 4 out 5 and called Kaminey [...] "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to. Watch it at least twice to fully appreciate this masterpiece."

2500|$|Before {{the late}} modern era, the abbot {{was treated with}} the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house. [...] When he {{appeared}} either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed. [...] His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king. [...] No monk might sit in his presence, <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society. [...] The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table. [...] In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks. [...] In the West the Rule of St Benedict appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers. [...] Because this permission {{opened the door to}} luxurious living, Synods of Aachen (816–819), decreed that the abbot should dine in the refectory, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots. [...] When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his chaplains waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.|$|E
2500|$|To {{keep the}} series intriguing, each season {{typically}} features {{a new twist}} to change {{the format of the}} game. This began with Big Brother 3 (2002) and the [...] "Expect the Unexpected" [...] twist. Other seasons feature smaller twists than have a smaller impact on the game, usually affecting that sole week. The most notable example of this is Pandora's Box, a twist that originated in Big Brother 11 (2009). The twist sees the current Head of Household for that week being tempted by the box, and can choose to either open the box <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> Should a HouseGuest choose to open Pandora's Box, both good and bad consequences could be unleashed into the house; these can affect not only the Head of Household but the other housemates.Similar formats are applied in later seasons, for example, the Den of Temptation introduced in season 19. Secret powers have also appeared in the past. Mike Malin was the first HouseGuest to receive a secret power, earning the Coup d'État during Big Brother: All-Stars (2006). The Coup d'État allowed the holder to remove one or both nominees from the block on eviction night, as well as choose who is nominated in their place. Malin chose not to use the power, and it subsequently returned during Big Brother 11 (2009) when Jeff Schroeder was given the power by the viewers. Matt Hoffman was given a Diamond Power of Veto during Big Brother 12 (2010), which allowed him to remove one HouseGuest from the block and choose the replacement nominee. During Big Brother 14 (2012), HouseGuest Ian Terry won a second Power of Veto, which could be used the same as the normal Power of Veto.|$|E
