40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the analyses of the efficiency of crude oil transportation system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Several aspects are included from which the amount of transportation tariff {{and the rate of}} the diversification of pipeline infrastructure are the most important. Its aim is to determine the oil delivery conditions through Druzhba and IKL pipelines during the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, the development of storage capacity and also the development of attempts to diverse the sources in both states. Firstly, I will outline the history of the formation of oil contractors in order to show the conditions of oil market in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Secondly, I will analyze the efficiency of the crude oil transportation and compare the Czech and Slovak refineries' costs for crude <b>oil</b> delivery <b>trough</b> this countries.

40|$|Knowledge and {{management}} of such knowledge have been studied {{for some time now}} in the field of Management. However, in the 1990 s, with the growth in the economy based on intangible assets, companies needed more than an unstructured approach to corporate knowledge management to succeed in this new competitive environment. Therefore, this article aims to identify, in an exploratory way, the relevant factors for tacit knowledge transfer within a major Brazilian <b>oil</b> company <b>trough</b> a case study. This study reviews the literature concerning tacit knowledge transfer within organizations, and using a quantitative approach based on exploratory factorial analysis, it collects facts in order to identify the relevant factors for tacit knowledge transfer within the organization under study. It can be said that idiosyncratic factors, the knowledge management strategy adopted by the company, and its organizational structure are the critical elements for the success of tacit knowledge transfer within the organization under analysis. Finally, three propositions arising from the results obtained are then consolidated and presented in order that they may be tested in a future explanatory study and the research limitation are unveiled...|$|R
40|$|Although {{not used}} {{by most of}} the solar thermal power plants today, the ability to store thermal energy is {{considered}} as their main technological advantage in the future. During the planning phase of solar plants with storage powerful and flexible simulation tools are required. The cycle simulation tool EBSILONProfessional has been extended by a solar thermal component library in release 9. 0 published in spring 2010. Besides steady-state calculations of the thermodynamic cycle, the tool offers a time series calculation module that allows simulation of solar thermal power plants with ntegrated thermal storage. The paper presents two examples for such calculation, the one being a molten salt parabolic trough plant and the second a conventional, <b>oil</b> based parabolic <b>trough</b> system. Both units are equipped with a two-tank molten salt storage...|$|R
40|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} can provide {{reliable}} power by incorporating either {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) or backup heat from fossil fuels. This paper describes a gas turbine / parabolic trough hybrid design that combines a solar contribution greater than 50 % with gas heat rates that rival those of natural gas combined-cycle plants. Previous work illustrated benefits of integrating gas turbines with conventional <b>oil</b> heat-transfer-fluid (HTF) <b>troughs</b> running at 390 ?C. This work extends that analysis to examine the integration of gas turbines with salt-HTF troughs running at 450 degrees C and including TES. Using gas turbine waste heat to supplement the TES system provides greater operating flexibility while enhancing the efficiency of gas utilization. The analysis indicates that the hybrid plant design produces solar-derived electricity and gas-derived electricity at lower cost than either system operating alone...|$|R

40|$|In oil-dependent countries, a {{major issue}} is how to {{stabilize}} fiscal spending when government revenue fluctuates along with the international price of oil. A stabilization fund would allow the government to pull through an <b>oil</b> price <b>trough</b> and absorb windfall revenue when prices are high. This paper focuses on two key issues. First, the paper proposes to base government spending on moving averages of past oil prices that are shown to behave nearly as a random walk. Second, it uses Monte Carlo simulations of a fiscal policy model {{to look at the}} probability that a given level of assets in the stabilization fund is exhausted over a certain number of years. The simulations show that with a fiscal policy based on moving averages over three to five years, a stabilization fund of about 75 percent of 2004 oil revenue would be adequate, which, in Nigeria, would equate to US$ 16 - 18 billion.

40|$|Existing thermal <b>oil</b> based {{parabolic}} <b>trough</b> collector (PTC) {{power plants}} have been commercially deployed since 2008. Parabolic trough technology dominates by ca. 90 % the global market of all operational commercial concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Worldwide over 32 % of these PTC power plants have an indirect salt thermal storage system that enables night operation [1, 2]. Since existing parabolic trough power plants with thermal oil are limited regarding their maximum operating temperature, the addition and integration with a molten salt tower systems (MSTS) could be an attractive option to increase the temperature level of the thermal storage and steam cycle and thus the overall efficiency of the plant. This paper describes the conception, investigation and techno-economic evaluation for retrofitting an existing Andasol type parabolic trough power plant. The most promising out of five coupling configurations has been analyzed and evaluated for three different retrofitting concepts using greenius and EBSILON®Professional simulation tools. The analysis shows that retrofitting concepts based on {{the addition of a}} MSTS are only economically attractive, if the capital expenditure for the power block modification does not exceed 440 $/kW. The retrofitting of existing PTCs with a MSTS is economically unviable...|$|R

40|$|Cost-effective {{integrated}} storage systems are important components for the accelerated market penetration of solarthermal power plants. Besides extended utilisation {{of the power}} block the main benefits of storage systems are improved efficiency of components, and facilitated integration into the electrical grids. For parabolic trough power plants using synthetic oil as the heat transfer medium, the application of solid media sensible heat storage is an attractive option in terms of investment and maintenance costs. For commercial <b>oil</b> <b>trough</b> technology, a solid media sensible heat storage system was developed and tested. One focus {{of the project was}} the cost reduction of the heat exchanger; the second focus lies in the energetic and exergetic analysis of modular storage operation concepts, including a cost assessment of these concepts. The results show that technically there are various interesting ways to improve storage performance. However, these efforts do not improve the economical aspect. Therefore the tube register with straight parallel tubes without additional structures to enhance heat transfer has been identified as the best option concerning manufacturing aspects and investment costs. The results of the energetic and exergetic analysis of modular storage integration and operation concepts show a significant potential for economic optimisation. An increase of more than 100 % in storage capacity or a reduction of more than factor 2 in storage size and therefore investment cost for the storage system was calculated. A complete economical analysis, including the additional costs for this concept on the solar field piping and control, still has to be performed...|$|E
