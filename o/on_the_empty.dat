5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E

40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} of liquids and solids {{was evaluated}} in ten dogs with gastric fistula {{before and after}} either truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, or pyloroplasty. In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact. When the antropyloric mechanism was removed by antrectomy, the effect of vagotomy was to accelerate <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of liquids (p less than 0. 05) but to impair <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids (p less than 0. 001). When the pylorus was destroyed by pyloroplasty, vagotomy markedly accelerated <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of liquids but had little effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids. Neither antrectomy nor pyloroplasty had any significant effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids. Pyloroplasty caused minor acceleration of emptying of liquids while antrectomy had no effect...|$|R

25|$|The {{offended}} team, if {{in control}} of the puck, will pull their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to be penalized touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} empty subset of a topological space {{is covered by}} the empty family of sets. The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a {{terminal}} object, and consequently {{the value of a}} sheaf <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are in the category of sets, applying the local identity axiom to the empty family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom to the empty family shows that {{there is at least one}} section. This property is called the normalisation axiom.|$|E

500|$|Kim Cattrall plays Valeris, the Enterprises new {{helmsman}} and {{the first}} Vulcan to graduate {{at the top of}} her class at Starfleet Academy. Valeris becomes the protégé of Captain Spock, who intends her to be his replacement. Initially, the character of Saavik, who appeared in the second through fourth Star Trek films, was intended to be the traitor, but Gene Roddenberry objected to making a character loved by fans into a villain. Cattrall was unwilling to be the third actress to play Saavik (a part she had originally auditioned for), but accepted the role when she became a different character. Cattrall chose the Eris element of the character's name, for the Greek goddess of strife, which was Vulcanised by the addition of the [...] "Val" [...] at the behest of director Nicholas Meyer. Cinefantastique reported that during filming, Cattrall participated in a photo shoot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> Enterprise bridge, where she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears. The story claimed Nimoy personally ripped up all of the photographs and negatives when he learned about the unauthorized photo session, because he feared harm to the franchise if it ever came to light.|$|E
500|$|The Allenville Mill Storehouse is a [...] two story square stone rubble-construction {{storehouse}} erected by Phillip Allen. The exact date {{of construction}} is unknown, but it was built with rubble-construction as was typical of mill construction {{during and after the}} War of 1812. In 1813, Allen purchased 4.5 acres from Esek Smith to construct a mill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> land. The exact date the mill and the storehouse was built is unknown, but Allen's brother, Zachariah, noted in his diary a payment from [...] "P. Allen for building his factory" [...] on March 5, 1821. The first record of the building is from an 1836 insurance policy obtained by Philip Allen for the cotton factory and a [...] "Store and cloth room". Further evidence it was used as the storehouse comes from a lithographic map from 1858 and in the town's deeds. Allen sold the property in 1857 and it changed owners again in 1860, and was renamed to the Smithfield Manufacturing Company. Ownership changed in 1879, and it was renamed Enfield Mills and transferred again in 1906 and renamed Esmond Mills. In 1937, the building was used as a post office and described erroneously as the [...] "Old Allenville Mill". The discovery that it was a storehouse and not the mill was made only during the National Register of Historic Places survey.|$|E

There was space for additional tips on the Mole, the south side of the dock and the basin. Hydraulic pressure was used to operate all the machinery, supplied by engine houses of which there were three [...] [...] An engineers' report of 1901 contained the following extract: The tips have lifts of 37, 42, and 45 feet, and are each capable of lifting 20 tons. All tips are provided with two weigh-bridges, one on the full and the other <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> roads. The machinery at the docks is worked by hydraulic power obtained at three engine-houses, which contain nine pairs of compound, horizontal, surface-condensing engines, with cylinders of 16 inches and 28 inches diameter and 24 inches stroke, indicating 250 H.P. per pair. Steam is supplied at 80 lbs. per square inch by twenty-five Lancashire boilers, 28 feet long by 7 feet diameter. The pressure-pumps are of the differential-ram principle, and maintain a pressure in the mains of 750 lbs. per square inch. The whole of the docks, coal-tips, sidings, etc., are lighted by electricity. Battery Hill pumphouse at Barry Island was demolished after 1945 but the main part of the Bendricks building (referred to as 'Sully hydraulic engine house' in R.A.COOKE'S section 44b GWR track diagrams) lived on until just after the Millennium and ironically, with the nationalisation of the former 'big four' railway groups to become British Railways (BR) in 1947, the Barry Railway initials survive on one of the gables at Barry Island railway station and the initials BR ...|$|E
