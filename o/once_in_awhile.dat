2500|$|The {{situation}} escalated {{over the}} weekend as executive producer, Mike Ryan, then jumped in to defend Le Batard where he buried Rapaport, pointing out the actor's many forgettable role's in his movies. After a lengthy back and forth, Rapaport still insisted on attacking Ryan, and eventually, another of the show's producer's, Roy Bellamy, jumped into the discussion. The twitter beef reached its climax with Rapaport posting a racist photo of Bellamy, and resulting in Ryan and Bellamy finishing their war with Rapaport. Following the weekend, Le Batard briefly discussed the events that had occurred {{over the weekend}} on his show, and proclaimed the end of Rapaport's guest appearances at ESPN. Le Batard stated, [...] "These things are all about value. How much value {{do you have to}} the company? Not enough to be putting up racist stuff on Twitter. He doesn’t work for the company. He’s on The Jump every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile.</b> So I’m guessing this is gonna cause him a problem. He doesn’t have enough value to the company, I don’t think, to withstand something like this.” ...|$|E

60|$|The knife {{belonged to}} {{the lady in the}} big green house.

He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "But then I was {{no better}} off than before, because the windows and {{the door of the}} room were fast shut. I grew more cross and ill-tempered than before, when I {{discovered}} this, and to add to my annoyance that miserable wooden bird would every <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> jump out and yell 'Cuck-oo!' and then bounce back into its house again, without daring to argue with me.|$|E

60|$|Deliberately, with candle held rigidly on a {{level with}} his eyes, Lawford pushed forward a pace or two into the airless, empty drawing-room, and grasped {{the handle of the}} door. He gazed <b>in</b> <b>awhile,</b> a black oblique shadow flung across his face, his eyes fixed like an animal's, then drew the door {{steadily}} towards him. And suddenly some power that had held him tense seemed to fail. He thrust out his head, and, his face quivering with fear and loathing, spat defiance as if in a passion of triumph into the gloom.|$|R
50|$|The season {{started on}} a bad note, with a {{relatively}} new Columbus Crew beating a disorganized D.C. United side at home 3-0, and then a 1-0 loss to a surprisingly hot Toronto FC side. However, the team began showing signs {{of life in a}} home game against the Chicago Fire. Though the game ended in a 2-2 draw, the newly signed Fabian Espindola and the promoted Kitchen helped to give D.C. United a 2-1 lead in the second half, something the team had not had in MLS season play <b>in</b> <b>awhile.</b>|$|R
60|$|The king grew to manhood {{and married}} the pretty {{daughter}} of the armorer, and they now have two lovely children of their own. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> {{they go into the}} big audience chamber of the palace and let the little ones watch the aged, hoary-headed counselor count out silver twenty-five-cent pieces to a withered old woman, who watched his every movement to see that he does not cheat her.|$|E
60|$|They went {{sleighing}} together, with {{shouting and}} laughter, {{as if the}} Doctor were a girl, too. They went skating, and <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> to some entertainment at the church. They were not theatre-going people, and the lectures and socials {{of the town and}} college made up their outings. It was the Doctor's merry interest in their doings which made young men so unnecessary to Rose as well as to Josephine.|$|E

[...] "The little thing would get along a good deal better with a woman, an' we can sneak back here <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> to make certain she's all right.

5000|$|Olaus Magnus {{wrote that}} the otter often fetches the catch for its master but [...] "once <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> forgets and eats the fish". [...] Izaak Walton's 1653 book {{describes}} otter pups, {{three to four months}} old, being domesticated and trained. The otters were muzzled to prevent them eating fish and secured by lines to their master. The otters then chased fish in a pond into a net. Another technique was to submerge nets and get the otters to shepherd the fish into them, after which the nets, along with otters and catch, were retrieved.|$|R

60|$|About {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} they stopped to eat. Hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete. He cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood. The Russians' lines were not very far ahead. Around him was {{what had once been}} a long valley, acres of fruit trees and grapes. Nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end. And the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind, settling over the weeds and remains of buildings, walls here and there, <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> what had been a road.|$|E
6000|$|Sam Cotting's General Store at Millville divided {{importance}} with Bob West's {{hardware store}} {{but was a}} more popular loafing place for the sparse population of the tiny town. The post office was located in one corner and the telephone booth in another, and this latter institution was regarded with much awe by the simple natives. <b>Once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> some one would telephone over to the Junction on some trivial business, but the long-distance call was never employed except by the [...] "nabobs"--the local name for John Merrick and his nieces--or by {{the manager of the}} new mill at Royal, who had extended the line to his own office {{in the heart of the}} pine forest.|$|E

60|$|From an English {{point of}} view {{there has not been}} the least attempt at grading those hills, and indeed you might as well try to grade the {{hillocks}} of Sind. The cable cars have for all practical purposes made San Francisco a dead level. They take no count of rise or fall, but slide equably on their appointed courses {{from one end to the}} other of a six-mile street. They turn corners almost at right angles, cross other lines, and for aught I know may run up the sides of houses. There is no visible agency of their flight, but <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>awhile</b> you shall pass a five-storied building humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wire cable, and the initiated will tell you that here is the mechanism. I gave up asking questions. If it pleases Providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles, and if for twopence halfpenny I can ride in that car, why shall I seek the reasons of the miracle? Rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood (to imitate stone), each house just big enough for a man and his family. Let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us, their ancestors.|$|E
