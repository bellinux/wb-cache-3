5|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible.

The declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|International governments, {{leaders and}} public figures also convey their {{greetings}} on the occasion. Overseas dignitaries are invited as chief guests in ceremonies, while foreign military contingents often participate in parades.

5|$|On December 12, 1916, Italy demanded {{explanations}} {{from the}} French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its ambassador, {{stating that the}} establishment of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë violated the Treaty of London. Austria-Hungary used the French precedent in Korçë to justify the proclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> of Albania under its protectorate on January 3, 1917 in Shkodër. The Kingdom of Italy followed suit when proclaiming the independence of Albania under its protectorate on June 23, 1917 in Gjirokastra.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 1983, on the 61st {{anniversary of}} de jure {{recognition}} of the three Baltic countries by the U.S. in 1922, President Ronald Reagan re-declared the United States' recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

5|$|The {{constitution}} also imposes {{restrictions on}} these rights. The government restricts these freedoms {{in the interest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence,</b> sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, {{the right to life}} and personal liberty cannot be suspended. The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Independence was {{involved}} in two important diplomatic missions, first in May 1836 carrying San Jacinto President David G. Burnet, with his cabinet, and Santa Anna to sign the Treaty of Velasco after the Battle of San Jacinto and then, in June, setting sail for New Orleans with commissioners Peter William Grayson and James W. Collinsworth on board. These men continued their journey to Washington, D.C., where they negotiated with the United States for the recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independence</b> Bowl, announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith, he likely would not have invited Tech to play in the game.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people {{rallied to}} commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations. This event, {{organized}} by the human rights group Helsinki-86, {{was the first time}} after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities. In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year {{to commemorate the}} anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water. Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to {{more than half a million}} participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> of Latvia was declared.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> movement.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E
