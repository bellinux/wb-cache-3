The present study was conducted by using Hong Kong as an example to assess the environmental sustainability of converting recycled <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> (from construction and demolition activities and <b>other</b> <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes)</b> to produce <b>wood</b> pellets for direct energy generation. The chemical and physical characteristics of different types of <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes</b> were tested. An attributional lifecycle assessment approach was used to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability for heat generation from the pelletized bio-fuel and coal. The test results showed that the energy content, chemical compositions and the trace metal concentrations all met the relevant standards. The results also showed that significant impacts on health, ecosystem, climate change and resources damage can be potentially avoided by using wood pellets instead of coal for energy generation. The overall findings demonstrated that the proposed "energy recovery" approach for using wood pellets as a bio-fuel in Hong Kong is environmentally sustainable, which can provide an alternative route for managing <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes</b> with the added benefits of energy recovery, and may be more applicable in mega cities especially when city-based incineration is a concern.

40|$|Issue: A {{priority}} in recovering <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> from any source is to minimize additional contaminants {{in the course}} of preparing the material for processing. Handling or storing <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> on bare ground, crushed rock, or asphalt paved surfaces are common practices. However, these practices introduce dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants into the <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material. Even the quality of the cleanest materials are downgraded. This degradation is more detrimental to the cleaner and higher value <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> than the lower value <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Lower quality <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> leads to lower market value and greater contamination removal requirements for the facility and end-user.

Träavfall kommer från skogsbruk, trä‐ och byggbranschen och rivningsplatser. Bland dem kan tre typer av träavfall identifieras: obehandlat träavfall (obehandlat trä betraktas som biomassa), lätt behandlat träavfall (från beläggning eller limning) och högbehandlat träavfall (från impregnering med CCA och kreosot, betraktas som farligt avfall). Enligt avfallsförordningen, är hantering av avfall i Europa inriktad mer mot återvinning och mindre mot eliminering. Bland de franska kraven, kan tre huvudsakliga tendenser iakttas för återvinning av träavfall: endast behandlat avfall kan behandlas i förbränningsanläggningar för energiutvinning, högbehandlat träavfall måste elimineras genom förbränning och lätt behandlat avfall kan antingen återvinnas som spånskivor eller elimineras. I detta sammanhang uppgår mängden träavfall från bygg‐ och rivningsplatser till 7 miljoner ton i Frankrike. Bland dem, motsvarar 5 % obehandlat trä, och 25 % är lätt behandlat. Den höga förbränningspotentialen för träavfall ger dessutom en möjlighet att ersätta konventionellt bränsle som används i förbränningsanläggningar. De fyra huvudsakliga metoder som används för att behandla träavfall är återvinning i spånskivor, förbränning med energiutvinning, förbränning och deponering. På grund av olika typer av träavfall, krävs ett konditioneringsteg innan återvinning. Även om förbränningen är fördelaktigt på grund av sitt neutrala kol, visar livscykelanalyser utsläpp av andra föroreningar. Dessutom visas att kontrollerade elimineringsmetoder har mindre miljöpåverkar än återvinningsmetoder som ej har rätt utrustning. Återvinning är alltså inte alltid att föredra om man beaktar de effekter som gjorts vid denna undersökningen. Konkurrensen mellan olika behandlingsmetoder och låga priser på träavfall är specifika ekonomiska aspekter som skulle kunna påverka utvecklingen inom området. Dessutom, den ökande acceptansen av människor för återvinning och lokala avfallshanteringsmetoder, liksom behovet av inhemska energikällor är faktorer som sannolikt kan främja bränsle från träavfall. Dessa drivkrafter utvecklas på ett mycket snabbt sätt. Avfallsförordningen är på väg mot införandet av standarder för att främja utvecklingen av lätt behandlat träavfalls bränsle. Tekniska och sociala förbättringar, exempelvis källsortering och utveckling av återvinningsmetoder ger också sannolikt positiva effekter. En integrerad lösning för att utveckla bränsle från träavfall skulle vara att genomföra starka ekonomiska incitament till förmån för ren teknik för återvinning av träavfall. Den här förbättringen kan sedan vara ett medel att anta den dubbla utmaningen av hantering av träavfall och ersättning av fossila bränslen...|$|R

50|$|Eighty {{percent of}} all Opinel knives use {{traditional}} beechwood for the handle. The company's large demand for beechwood not infrequently results in a shortage of precut handle blanks, forcing the use of rectangular (bulk) sheets, which generate considerable <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> The excess <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> and sawdust generated is subsequently recycled.|$|R
40|$|Wood {{industries}} produce {{large volumes}} of residues which must be utilized, marketed or properly disposed of. Heaps of wood residues are common features in wood industries throughout the year. In Nigeria, this residue is generally regarded as waste and {{this has led to}} open burning practices, dumping in water bodies or dumping in an open area which constitutes environmental pollution. Sawmills in Nigeria generated over 1, 000, 000 m 3 of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> in 2010 while about 5000 m 3 of waste was generated in plywood mills. Nigeria generates about 1. 8 million tons of sawdust annually and 5. 2 million tons of <b>wood</b> <b>wastes.</b> The impact of improper disposal of <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> on the environment affects both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Also burning of <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causing various health issues. Reuse/recycling of these wood residues in Nigeria will reduce the pressure on our ever decreasing forests, reduce environmental pollution, create wealth and employment. The literature available on this subject was reviewed and this article, therefore, focuses on the various methods of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> disposal and its utilization in Nigerian wood industries, the effects of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> on the environment as well as on human health and the benefits of proper <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> management practices...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} a survey that was conducted to determine the extent and magnitude of problems associated with the disposal of PCP-treated <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> at Army installations. Practices being used to reduce the cost associated with disposal of PCP-treated <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> are also summarized. There is considerable variation among Army installations regarding the handling of PCP-treated wood. At most installations, the PCP-treated <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> is either shredded and composted for use as mulch on the installation or it is disposed of in a sanitary landfill at a cost of around $ 30 per ton. However, some installations are paying up to $ 500 per ton to dispose of the <b>wood</b> as hazardous <b>waste.</b> Most installations have little PCP in their woodwaste streams while others have enough PCP in the <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> to garner a hazardous waste classification. According to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), if the concentration of PCP in the wood-waste stream exceeds 100 mg/l (using the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to make a model that identifi es fl ows and use of roundwood and <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> in Slovenia in the basic year. A new conceptual model was created. On the basis of this model, two roundwood and one <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> balance were prepared. A wide range of available data was takeninto consideration, the quality of data evaluated and a proposal for improving their quality prepared. The results of roundwood balance showed a defi cit of 536, 000 m 3, if offi cial data for annual removals were taken intoaccount. In the case of modelled (enlarged) removals, the roundwood balance is positive. The use of 297. 000 t of <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> in <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> balance remains unknown.

40|$|Issue: During {{community}} growth, adjacent forests become {{candidates for}} purchase and development; otherwise, they typically do not generate profit. To accommodate developments, developers remove trees, soil, {{and other materials}} from construction sites. In some regions, they use crawling bulldozers to knock down trees and pull up root balls for on-site burning. However, a sufficient quantity of wood upon a site makes it practicable to cut tree stems and ship logs to local markets. The roots and branches usually remain as landclearing waste. Traditionally, developers burned or buried this <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> on-site. <b>Wood</b> <b>waste</b> could also be shipped off-site, either for disposal or, increasingly, for centralized wood processing. Furthermore, on-site processing is increasingly being used to recycle <b>wood</b> <b>waste,</b> often using a mobile tub grinder. Most professional development and landclearing contractors know the options available in their region for the <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> they generate. Some may not, however, and {{it is wise to}} check with trade associations, recycling organizataions, and local solid waste utilities to get a list of wood recyclers that can provide <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> services. Best Practice: Urbanization, which develops vegetated land for homes, commerce, or industry, generates landclearing debris. Developers could profit when they remove vegetation that includes trees...|$|R
40|$|Issue: <b>Wood</b> <b>waste</b> {{supplies}} are diverse, ranging from sawdust or shavings to large stumps, containers or portions of structural framing. In some situations, the larger pieces of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> {{are difficult to}} load into the primary size reduction equipment. On occasion, the material is simply too large {{to fit into the}} equipment throat. As a result, reducing bulk before conveying to the primary size-reduction equipment presents some advantages. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the use of bulk reduction equipment to prepare large <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material for feeding into size reduction equipment. The appropriate type of bulk reduction equipment depends on the characteristics of the incoming raw material and downstream equipment. These equipment are discussed below: Mobile Bulk Reduction Attachments: Rolling stock equipment can be fitted with various attachments for reducing the bulk of large <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> materials. The types of attachments available for front-end loaders and excavators include shears, pulverizers, densifier grapples, and stump splitters. These attachments can be customized to reduce raw materials ranging from pallets and structural framing to stumps. Rolling Stock Compaction: This method of bulk reduction is accomplished by driving the rolling stock over large <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> before loading it into the processing system. This type of compaction may create to...|$|R
