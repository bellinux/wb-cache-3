5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can {{be shown to be}} uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by <b>other</b> <b>arguments.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. <b>Other</b> <b>arguments</b> propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E

Another important case allows the scalars to come from any field and the twist is provided by a field automorphism.|$|R
25|$|Jackson {{used the}} {{knowledge}} argument, {{as well as}} <b>other</b> <b>arguments,</b> to establish a sort of dualism, according to which certain mental states, especially qualitative ones, are non-physical. The view that Jackson urged was a modest version of epiphenomenalism—the view that certain mental states are non-physical and, although caused to come into existence by physical events, do not then cause any changes in the physical world.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the chapel occurred in an undetermined point in the high Middle Ages. Defenders of the Visigothic chronology of events, point to an inscription dated from 588. <b>Other</b> <b>arguments,</b> enunciated by Lampérez y Romea, point to the triumphal arch and basilica-like plan that was adapted to favour its Visiothic origins. The idea of a 6th–7th century church gained favour directly and was repeated by other authors, such as Schlunk, Fernando de Almeida and Hauschild, among others. But in recent years, {{the hypothesis that the}} church was a 9th or early 10th century construction has been advanced. First, by Joaquim de Vasconcelos, who used the church of São Pedro de Lourosa (dated 912), but later by Real, Ferreira de Almeida, Barroca and Teixeira, in addition to others.|$|E
25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} is marriage between cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents {{or people who}} share other fairly recent ancestors). Opinions and practice vary widely across the world. In some cultures and communities, cousin {{marriage is}} considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it is subject to social stigma. Cousin marriage is common in the Middle East, for instance, where it accounts for over half of all marriages in some countries. In some countries outside that region, it is uncommon but still legal. In others, {{it is seen as}} incestuous and is legally prohibited: it is banned in China and Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, and 24 of the 50 United States. Supporters of cousin marriage where it is banned may view the prohibition as discrimination, while opponents may appeal to moral or <b>other</b> <b>arguments.</b> Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins.|$|E

25|$|In December 2010, several groups, {{including}} the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, {{filed suit against}} the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA {{does not have the}} authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among <b>other</b> <b>arguments,</b> the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{arguing that the}} rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory {{point out that the}} symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. <b>Other</b> <b>arguments</b> include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.|$|E
25|$|At {{the later}} conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later {{the same year}} and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, {{the name of the}} court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court {{completely}} replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. <b>Other</b> <b>arguments</b> posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law. Some politicians, such as Sir George Dibbs, supported the petitioners, but others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.|$|E

25|$|The Khasansky District lies {{near the}} Sino-North Korean border and the Sino-Russian border and {{included}} two disputed regions along the Tumen River. According to the agreement, 3km² (1mi²) of territory would {{be transferred to}} China, and Chinese ships would gain the right to navigate the Tumen river. The territory transfer would connect a previously enclaved piece of Chinese territory {{to the rest of}} China (Fangchuancun). This portion of the agreement stirred up some controversy among some Russian officials from Primorsky Krai, as they felt that direct Chinese access to the Sea of Japan (through the Tumen River) would decrease the economic importance of Vladivostok and Nakhodka. <b>Other</b> <b>arguments</b> protested at potential pollution from Chinese economic development, the possibility of Chinese military vessels navigating the river, and the presence of a Russian cemetery commemorating the Lake Khasan Incident in the area. Finally, in June 1997, the Russian side proposed a resolution which would divide the disputed territory in half. This was accepted by China in September of the same year, and in November, when the border demarcation work was declared finished, 1.6km² (0.6mi²) were transferred to China, and 1.4km² (0.5mi²) were retained by Russia. The Lake Khasan cemetery remained on the Russian side, and the Chinese officials underwent informal agreements to not build a port along the Tumen River.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1999, Siegel's widow Joanne Siegel, {{and their}} daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, filed a {{copyright}} termination notice. Warner Bros. contested this copyright termination, making {{the status of}} Siegel's share of the copyright {{the subject of a}} legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice. DC made a settlement offer to Larson and her family on October 16, 2001, and three days later, DC received a letter from Larson’s attorney accepting the offer, which included millions of dollars in payment in exchange for the copyrights. This offer was set aside by the Siegels at the last minute and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. countersued, alleging, among <b>other</b> <b>arguments,</b> that the termination notice contains defects. On March 26, 2008, Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ruled that Siegel's estate was entitled to claim a share in the United States copyright. The ruling does not affect the international rights which Time Warner holds in the character through its subsidiary DC Comics. Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel's estate and whether the claim the estate has extends to derivative works such as movie versions will be settled at trial, although any compensation would only be owed from works published since 1999. The case was scheduled to be heard in a California federal court in May 2008.|$|E

In addition, there are <b>other</b> <b>arguments</b> against Leofric's having been the forger. Aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser's material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith's theory. Galbraith's arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by Dorothy Whitelock in Genuine Asser, in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Statements which {{imply that}} nature has goals, for example where a species {{is said to}} do {{something}} [...] "in order to" [...] achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences {{so that they do}} not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection; <b>other</b> <b>arguments</b> against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.|$|E
