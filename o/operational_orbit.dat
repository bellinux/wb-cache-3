40|$|Three {{types of}} {{propulsion}} - liquid, solid and cold gas - {{were used to}} get the three AMPTE (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers) spacecraft into their <b>operational</b> <b>orbits.</b> The booster, a thrust-augmented DELTA, placed the 1028 kg (2267 lb) international payload into a 555 km x 8. 78 Re x 28. 7 deg transfer orbit. Solids carried aloft {{by two of the}} spacecraft were then fired to tilt one orbit and elevate the other. Cold gas provided two of the spacecraft with torquing capabilities for attitude maneuvering. All told, it took 12 solid, 2 liquid and 2 cold gas propulsion units to get the three AMPTE spacecraft off the ground and into their <b>operational</b> <b>orbits.</b> The relationships between all of them {{and the manner in which}} they were utilized on August 16, 1984 the day of the launch - are discussed here...|$|R
50|$|A {{graveyard}} orbit, {{also called}} a junk orbit or disposal orbit, is an orbit that lies away from common <b>operational</b> <b>orbits,</b> typically a supersynchronous orbit well above synchronous orbit. Satellites are moved into such orbits {{at the end}} of their operational life to reduce the probability of colliding with operational spacecraft or generating space debris.|$|R
50|$|The Radioastron was {{expected}} to extend into a highly elliptical orbit in the Fregat state of the Zenit rocket's launch. Spektr-Râ€™s closest point (perigee) would be 500 km above the Earth's surface, with its apogee 340000 km away. The <b>operational</b> <b>orbit</b> would last at least nine years, with the Radioastron never being in the Earth's shadow {{for more than two}} hours.|$|E
50|$|GOES 14, {{known as}} GOES-O prior to {{reaching}} its <b>operational</b> <b>orbit,</b> is an American weather satellite, {{which is part}} of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system. The spacecraft was built by Boeing and is based on the BSS-601 bus. It is the second of three GOES satellites to use the BSS-601 bus, after GOES 13, which was launched in May 2006.|$|E
50|$|INTEGRAL's <b>operational</b> <b>orbit</b> has {{a period}} of 72 hours, and has a high eccentricity, with perigee close to the Earth at 10,000 km, within the magnetospheric {{radiation}} belt. However, most of each orbit is spent outside this region, where scientific observations may take place. It reaches a furthest distance from Earth (apogee) of 153,000 km. The apogee {{was placed in the}} northern hemisphere, to reduce time spent in eclipses, and maximize contact time over the ground stations in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Because the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles {{are more}} {{powerful}} than the Delta II, which was used to orbit earlier Block II GPS satellites, they can place the satellites directly into their <b>operational</b> <b>orbits.</b> As a result, Block IIF satellites do not carry apogee kick motors. The original contract for Block IIF, signed in 1996, called for 33 spacecraft. This was later reduced to 12, and program delays and technical problems pushed the first launch from 2006 to 2010.|$|R

40|$|The Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) {{region is}} {{becoming}} increasingly exploited {{as the number of}} navigation constellations grows {{with the advent of the}} European GALILEO and the Chinese COMPASS systems. There is the need for an effective disposal strategy of satellites at end-of- life able to prevent any possible damage of operational satellites. This strategy has to take into account the known instability of nearly circular disposal orbits in MEO. These orbits show an increase of the eccentricity that could lead to dangerous crossings of the <b>operational</b> <b>orbits.</b> The nature of this instability, linked to luni-solar resonances, is briefly recalled. Then the effect of different disposal strategies on the long term evolution of theMEO environment is analyzed. It is shown how the disposal of satellites at end-of-life into well separated storage zones, above the constellations <b>operational</b> <b>orbits,</b> is capable of limiting the collision risk for operational satellites to very low values for long time spans (200 years). Moreover, a disposal into eccentric orbits not only keeps the collision risk to very low values, but also has the advantage of reducing the lifetime of the disposed satellites, thus freeing the orbital environment from the uncontrolled spacecraft...|$|R
5000|$|To {{solve the}} problem, the perigee {{altitude}} {{was raised to}} 4700 km (2900 miles) using twelve firings of the smaller Reaction Engine Assembly thrusters, originally intended for attitude control during LAE maneuvers. [...] From this altitude, the solar arrays were deployed and the orbit was raised toward the <b>operational</b> <b>orbit</b> {{over the course of}} nine months using the 0.27 Newton Hall thrusters, a form of electric propulsion which is highly efficient, but produces very low thrust and so is very slow.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch of}} MSTI-3 {{occurred}} on 17 May 1996 at 02:44 UTC. The flight took place aboard a Pegasus Hybrid air-launched rocket carried by Orbital Science's Stargazer Lockheed L-1011 aircraft staged out of Vandenberg Air Force Base. Stargazer {{flew to the}} Point Arguello Warning Area Drop Zone {{off the coast of}} California and dropped the Pegasus rocket at an altitude of 38000 ft. The spacecraft was deposited into a 361 by 296 km initial orbit and used its on-board thrusters to reach an <b>operational</b> <b>orbit</b> of approximately 425 km.|$|E
50|$|For {{satellites}} in {{geostationary orbit}} and geosynchronous orbits, the graveyard orbit {{is a few}} hundred kilometers above the <b>operational</b> <b>orbit.</b> The transfer to a graveyard orbit above geostationary orbit requires {{the same amount of}} fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of stationkeeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators try to perform such a maneuver {{at the end of their}} satellites' operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded. However, as of 2011, most recently decommissioned geosynchronous spacecraft were said to have been moved to a graveyard orbit.|$|E
40|$|Space reactor {{power systems}} with {{characteristics}} ideal for advanced spacecraft systems applications are discussed. These characteristics are: high power-to-weight ratio (15 to 33 W/kg); high volume density (high ballistic coefficient); no preferential orientation in orbit; long operational life; high reliability; and total launch and operational safety. These characteristics allow {{the use of}} electric propulsion to raise spacecraft from low earth parking <b>orbits</b> to <b>operational</b> <b>orbits,</b> greatly increasing the useful orbit payload for a given launch vehicle by {{eliminating the need for}} a separation injection stage.

40|$|The {{benefits}} and costs associated with placing large space systems (LSS) in <b>operational</b> <b>orbits</b> were investigated, and a flexible computer model for analyzing these {{benefits and}} costs was developed. A mission model for LSS was identified that included both NASA/Commercial and DOD missions. This model included a total of 68 STS launches for the NASA/Commercial missions and 202 launches for the DOD missions. The mission catalog was of sufficient depth to define the structure type, mass and acceleration limits of each LSS. Conceptual primary propulsion stages (PPS) designs for orbital transfer were developed for three low thrust LO 2 /LH 2 engines baselined for the study. The performance characteristics {{for each of these}} PPS was compared to the LSS mission catalog to create a mission capture. The costs involved in placing the LSS in their <b>operational</b> <b>orbits</b> were identified. The two primary costs were that of the PPS and of the STS launch. The cost of the LSS was not included as it is not a function of the PPS performance. The basic relationships and algorithms {{that could be used to}} describe the costs were established. The benefit criteria for the mission model were also defined. These included mission capture, reliability, technical risk, development time, and growth potential. Rating guidelines were established for each parameter. For flexibility, each parameter is assigned a weighting factor...|$|R

On June 5, 2013, with Landsat 5's fuel reserve completely depleted, the USGS Flight Operations Team issued commands {{to shut off all}} moving mechanisms and hobble the spacecraftâ€™s ability to generate and store power from its solar arrays. The final command shut down Landsat 5â€™s transmitter, silencing the mission permanently and effectively terminating the mission 29 years, 3 months and 4 days after its launch.|$|E
50|$|Geo-IK-2 No.11 was {{launched}} by a Rokot rocket with a Briz-KM upper stage. The launch took place from Site 133/3 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, at 14:00 UTC on 1 February 2011. The Rokot performed as expected, and the Briz-KM {{made the first}} of two burns to place the satellite into its <b>operational</b> <b>orbit.</b> When the second burn was scheduled to begin, the Briz-KM failed to reignite, leaving the spacecraft in its transfer orbit. Controllers were unable to make contact with the satellite after launch as had been expected, although a day after launch they were able to establish communications with it. Before its orbit decayed from low Earth orbit, it flew a perigee of 368.8 km and an apogee of 1021.1 km, inclined at 99.4 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} are cylindrical (2.9 x 1.3 m, see online 3D model) and are spinning at 15 rotations per minute.

50|$|The four later {{satellites}} were Block II spacecraft, {{which featured}} an additional medium data-rate payload. The first Block II satellite (DFS-3m, a hybrid mix of largely Block I support systems and LDR payload and a MDR (Medium Data Rate) Block II payload) was launched on 30 April 1999, using a Titan IV(401)B rocket. Due to a database error affecting the {{attitude control system}} of the Centaur upper stage of its carrier rocket, it was placed into a lower orbit than had been planned, and damaged by deployment at excessive rates. It could not be raised into its <b>operational</b> <b>orbit</b> due to fuel limitations.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using orbiting mirrors to reflect sunlight to Earth for several illumination applications is studied. A constellation of sixteen 1 km solar reflector spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit can illuminate a region 333 km in diameter to 8 lux, which is brighter than most existing expressway lighting systems. This constellation can serve one region {{all night long}} or can provide illumination during mornings and evenings to five regions across the United States. Preliminary cost estimates indicate such an endeavor is economically feasible. The studies also explain how two solar reflectors can illuminate the in-orbit nighttime operations of Space Shuttle.

40|$|CubeSats {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} one of the easiest and cheapest ways to exploit space. At the same time the effort in expanding and enhancing their capabilities is rapidly leading to the definition of a very responsive standardized platform with a number of possible applications. One of the major performance-limiting factors for CubeSats, however, is the near- impossibility of selecting, maintaining or changing <b>operational</b> <b>orbits</b> at will. So far, CubeSats have been launched as piggyback payloads; as such, they have no command on the <b>operational</b> <b>orbits</b> in which they will be released. A cost-effective and flexible solution to deploy a swarm of nanosatellites into different orbits is represented by a manoeuvrable deployment vehicle equipped with electric propulsion currently under development at Alta. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present this new approach for the CubeSat deployment system. Instead of going through the endeavour of embedding a propulsion system into a single CubeSat, the idea is to provide the deployment system with thrusting capabilities and to use this platform to deliver the various CubeSats into different orbits. The alternative presented here is to consider a manoeuvrable platform as an effective solution to deploy a set of CubeSats into different orbits. Following this approach, it would be possible to have a whole CubeSat constellation deployed on different planes and/or at different altitudes, thus offering a wide range of opportunities to have different kinds of experiments and/or observational data. The use of electric propulsion allows for a larger payload mass fraction with respect to standard chemical thrusters, thanks to the higher specific impulse of these devices. The vehicle design, tailored to the fairing volume and launch mass capability of the Shtilâ€Ÿ launcher and compatible with standard Cubesat deployers (P-POD), is based on Altaâ€Ÿs HT- 100 Hall effect thruster system. With a specific impulse in excess of 1200 s, the HT- 100 can operate at 100 to 400 W for extended periods. The paper outlines the vehicle design and several mission scenarios. A trade-off study among propellant mass, platform architecture, number of deployed CubeSats, and system cost is presented, highlighting the potential benefits to multiple CubeSat or nanosatellite missions...|$|R
