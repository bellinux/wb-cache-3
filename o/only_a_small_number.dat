5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of randomized controlled trials had been conducted {{at the time of}} the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This was one of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here {{has been seen as}} part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of subtypes varies between countries. In Europe and the United States, 60–80% {{of people with}} Guillain–Barré syndrome have the demyelinating subtype (AIDP), and AMAN affects <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> (6–7%). In Asia and Central and South America, that proportion is significantly higher (30–65%). This {{may be related to}} the exposure to different kinds of infection, but also the genetic characteristics of that population. Miller Fisher variant is thought to be more common in Southeast Asia.|$|E

Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E

In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the Route 2 designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of changes have been made since then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|As senator, Ford has {{introduced}} many bills with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> becoming law, {{but has been}} more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s {{as a symbol of}} discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays. Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve race relations in South Carolina.|$|E

A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly {{due to a lack of}} livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served with}} the fleet {{following}} their commissioning in 1875, though they spent {{a significant part of}} their career in reserve, as Germany maintained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of ships on active duty for training cruises in the period. The ships were substantially rebuilt in the 1890s into armored cruisers and stationed in Asia for three years. Kaiser was the flagship of Otto von Diederichs's East Asia Squadron during the Kiautschou Bay concession seizure in November 1897. Following their return to Germany in 1899–1900, the ships were used in several secondary roles, including as harbor and barracks ships. The ships were stricken from the naval register in 1906; Deutschland was used as a target ship before being sold for scrap in 1908, though Kaiser served on as a floating barracks until she was sold in 1920.|$|E
