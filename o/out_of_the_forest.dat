5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

She is found by a mask-wearing, human-like entity named Gin, who informs Hotaru that he will disappear forever if he is touched by a human. Gin then leads Hotaru <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Hotaru returns to visit Gin in the forest {{over the next few days}} and they become friends despite the limitations on their interactions. Although at summer's end she must leave Gin to return to the city and her studies, Hotaru promises to return to visit him every summer holiday.|$|E

25|$|To {{the east}} of Rocherath and Krinkelt, the Germans had made a deep {{penetration}} and were liable at any moment to come bursting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The U.S. had to hold the twin villages to allow the 2nd ID with its heavy weapons and vehicles to reach positions around Elsenborn intact.

25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of habitat, more and more species of fauna have started to venture into human {{habitation}} causing a conflict between humans and fauna. A typical species affected by this is the elephant which ventures <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> into human cultivations thereby eating or destroying the crops. In some cases, the elephants have also caused human deaths like an incident that happened in Hassan district where a villager was trampled to death. Precautionary measures (sometimes illegally) taken up by humans to prevent such mishaps like electric fencing have also led to disastrous consequences like electrocution of fauna.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the time}} between 1685 and the early 18th century, the patent was ignored and land was {{gradually}} purchased from the Lenni Lenape causing confusion and disputes over ownership. Following the initial sale of land, {{the history of the}} township starts about 1685, when the land was first settled by European farmers from Scotland, England and the Netherlands. The Scottish exiles and early Dutch settlers lived on isolated clearings carved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The lingua franca or common language spoken in the area was likely, overwhelmingly Dutch. However, this was one of many languages spoken with the culture very steeped in New Netherlander. The official documentation at the time is frequently found to be in the Dutch language. The documents of the time also suggest that money transactions used the British shilling. The English and Scotch settlers were Quakers. After initial European contact, the Lenape population sharply declined.|$|E
25|$|The road {{continues}} its slow northeastern progression until a fork at CR37 (Fairview Road), where it darts northeastward at a shorter angle. NY223 soon turns eastward, entering the hamlet of Erin. In Erin, it serves the southern terminus of CR38 (Laurel Hill Road) and soon turns northward on a right-of-way served by CR4 (Marsh Road). NY223 soon leaves Erin and becomes known as Swartwood Hill Road, as which it {{turns to the}} northeast through fields, residences and woods. After the intersection with Drake Road, the route rises in elevation using switchbacks up Swartwood Hill, where the alignment heads through a dense wooded area. After winding its way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> NY223 {{ends up in the}} town of Van Etten and its hamlet of Swartwood. There, the route turns eastward on a right-of-way taken from CR14 (Swartwood Road). At an intersection with nearby CR24 (Decker Road), NY223 darts northeast to cross a railroad alignment and reach its east end at an intersection with NY224.|$|E
25|$|At 7:18p.m. ADT, {{the first}} 9-1-1 call {{was made to}} police about an armed man walking down a {{sidewalk}} on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street.

Mathieu Daigle stepping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on him while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive in a few minutes.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Lagun Ein's career, Gen. Byat Za was his {{commanding}} officer, and shielded the straight-talking Lagun Ein. The Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle reports {{one incident}} in which Byat Za was displeased with Lagun Ein's performance. It was late 1402 when Pegu's war with Ava had resumed. By then, Razadarit's invasion of Ava that began a year earlier had faltered, and Ava was on the offensive. Razadarit sent Byat Za with an army to meet the enemy, and Byat Za in turn assigned Lagun Ein to lead the vanguard regiment. The two armies met near the Thawutti village, and Lagun Ein's vanguard force engaged the enemy. But because other columns did not follow, his regiment was thoroughly defeated and disbanded, with survivors fleeing to the woods to hide. The remaining Hanthawaddy regiments led by Byat Za did not lose nerve, and met the Ava army the next day. It was the Ava forces that overstretched this time. Lagun Ein and his remaining forces came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to encircle the Ava army, and the Hanthawaddy army won the battle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} in Belgium, the Allies were still {{involved}} in the Battle of the Scheldt, while {{in the south in}} France the Lorraine Campaign was still ongoing. In the center, the Battle of Aachen was fought from 2–21 October at the German border. The heavy German resistance upset Allied plans for a fast resumption of the rapid advance. As preparation for Operation Queen, a preliminary offensive into the Hürtgen Forest had to be carried out, to secure the flanks against a possible German counterattack <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The goal was to clear a pathway to the important road junction at Düren, to gain a respectable starting position for Queen. The 9th Infantry Division was already engaged in the forest since September, so only moderate German resistance was expected. On 2 November, three days before the anticipated start of Operation Queen, the offensive against the town of Schmidt was launched by the 28th Division against the German 275th Division. The town was captured, but the Germans reacted swiftly by reallocating forces of the 89th Infantry Division and mobile reserves from the 116th Panzer Division, which drove the Allies out of the town, transforming the battle into a bloody stalemate.|$|E
25|$|Kali is the {{grandfather}} of Svarocisa Manu, {{one of the}} progenitors of mankind. As previously mentioned, Kali had a son named Svarocisa with the Apsara Varuthini. Svarocisa once traveld to Mt. Mandara and was met by Manorama, a cursed-woman being chased by a demon. In the past, she had made fun of a sage practicing Tapasya austerities on Mt. Kailas and was cursed to be captured by a demon. When her friends Vibhavari and Kalavati berated the sage for enacting a curse for such a minor offence, he cursed one to be a leper {{and the other a}} carrier of diseases. Manorama had knowledge of a powerful spiritual weapon, but {{did not know how to}} wield it, so she taught it to Svarocisa. When the demon leaped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and grabbed a hold of the woman, Svarocis called forth the weapon. But the demon stayed his hand and explained he was actually Manorama’s father, Indivara. He had also been cursed to become a demon by the sage Brahmamitra because he tried to covertly obtain the secrets of Ayurveda medicine without the sage’s knowledge. The sage told him that the curse would end when he was about to eat his own daughter. Once he regained his true form, Indivara taught Svarocisa the Ayurveda medication, which he used to cure Manorama’s friends. He later married the three and had three sons with them. He learned the languages of all creatures from Vibhavari and the Padmini vidya from Kalavati.|$|E

He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him {{on the roof of}} the shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone.

He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are a rabbit-like {{race that}} can live {{three times as}} long as a Hume, and divided into two subraces: The light-skinned Veena and dark-skinned Rava. The Viera have rabbit or deer-like features, most notably their long ears. Their feet are shaped {{in such a way that}} in order to stand they must wear high heels. Their slender forms heighten their senses and speed, and {{although}} their defense is low, Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by the other races. In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Vieras have blue-white, pale green, or purple-white hair, with only a few having hair that is pure white, which is considered to be a blessing. Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist, and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist. In Final Fantasy XII, they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice. The Viera believe themselves to be intimately tied to the [...] "Wood", a part of the forests themselves, and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood. A Viera that moves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> like Fran, is considered an outcast and dead to her people. Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society, dyeing their white hair. Regarding the lack of males seen, it is found that males and females live separately, only meeting when there is a need for it.|$|E
