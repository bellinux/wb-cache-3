2500|$|In 2012, Senator Brown {{urged the}} Department of Defense {{to comply with}} a rule that {{requires}} military service members to wear clothes and boots made in the U.S. rather than in China. [...] "If it's taxpayer dollars, it should help American workers and American businesses, pure and simple. <b>Our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in uniform are fighting for their country, and deserve to fight in quality uniforms and boots that are made in the U.S.A."

2500|$|On Monday 19 May Col.

In his declaration Khamada announced that his unit would join Haftar's Libyan National Army [...] "with all <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> weapons". Khamada argued that the operation was [...] "the work of the people". By Monday the death toll for Friday's clashes had reached 79. However, the Tripoli-based Al-Qaeda-inspired Lions of Monotheism group announced that it would fight forces loyal to Gen. Haftar.|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, 2007, Gates {{announced}} that he would not recommend the renomination of Peter Pace, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, due to anticipated difficulties with the confirmation process. Instead, Gates recommended Mike Mullen, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, to fill the position. Gates stated: [...] "I am no stranger to contentious confirmations, and I do not shrink from them. However, I have decided that at this moment in our history, the nation, <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in uniform, and General Pace himself would not be well-served by a divisive ordeal in selecting the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."

[...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by <b>our</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not know I had made a touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to {{the views}} McNamara held on Vietnam {{just before he}} left office—no further {{increases}} in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed, according to The Washington Post, [...] "that the war was being won by the allies" [...] and that it [...] "would be won if America had the will to win it." [...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found out that we couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all {{we were going to}} do was just waste the lives of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin {{to defend}} Hefei, a {{strategic}} location {{at the border}} between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops {{out of the city}} to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders. Zhang Liao said, [...] "Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the two of you still hesitating?" [...] Li Dian was moved and he said, [...] "This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can I allow my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?" [...] Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.|$|E

6000|$|... "The sound {{seemed to}} come from away towards the right, where I knew that one of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> was out, herding the bullocks; so I clapped spurs to my horse, and rode in that direction. When I got near, I saw the cattle running wildly about, and a mob of black fellows among them. I could see no signs of <b>our</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> guessed that he must have gone down; and that I had best ride and warn them, at the house.|$|R
60|$|Against {{the first}} of these {{annoyances}} we have always been able to guard ourselves, at least in a measure, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the cook declare that they have become so used to them that they do not mind them; but to guard against burglars is much more difficult, and to become used to them would, I think, require a great deal of practice.|$|R
2500|$|When Cao Cao retreated {{after being}} {{defeated}} by Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs {{in the winter}} of 208–209, he left behind Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian with about 7,000 soldiers to guard Hefei (合肥; present-day Hefei, Anhui) from possible attacks by Sun Quan. In around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote, [...] "Open when the enemy comes" [...] on the envelope. Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read, [...] "If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle." [...] They were confused after reading the letter. Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian, [...] "Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation – when the enemy has just arrived and isn't fully gathered yet – to attack them and devastate their morale so we can calm <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the two of you still hesitating?" [...] The three generals then worked together and recruited over 800 elite soldiers that night and prepared for battle the following day.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} resistance to adopting a westernized, mainstream feminist approach to Indigenous rights and self-determination. The most significant criticism of mainstream feminism {{has been its}} marginalization of minorities and lack of racial diversity. White feminists [...] "are extraordinarily reluctant to see themselves in the situation of being oppressors, as they feel {{that this will be}} at the expense of concentrating upon being oppressed." [...] The priority of white women's needs before those of Indigenous women have a historical root, and therefore make Indigenous feminists weary of homogenizing the rights of [...] "women". While Indigenous women may acknowledge that there is overlap in the goals of Indigenous feminists and mainstream feminists, many, like Celeste Liddle (Arrernte) [...] "strongly believe that as Aboriginal women, whilst our fights are related to ongoing feminist struggles within other racially marginalised groups, they are not the same." [...] An argument made by Minnie Grey in her essay, From the Tundra to the Boardroom to Everywhere in Between, about feminism is how it often fails to look beyond female oppression at other issues, such as class, education, and the effects of oppression has on men. [...] "We, as Inuit women, have been striving for such things as equal pay for equal work, equal share of roles {{for the good of the}} family, equal rights to participate in the decision-making processes of our governments, equal rights for the hiring of women at all levels of commerce and science, equal rights in education, and most importantly, equal rights to raise our children in safe, healthy, and positive conditions. This means, among other things, above the poverty line. I look at these aspirations not as women's liberation, but as people's liberation. In fact, we need and love <b>our</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> similarly, we need to liberate them from the concepts that bind them to unbreakable traditional roles that, in turn, keep the status quo intact in many regions of the world."One such example of the need to incorporate uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the second wave's struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, the second wave's fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|E
