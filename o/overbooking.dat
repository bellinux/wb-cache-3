5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to <b>overbooking.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed <b>overbooking.</b> This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight. On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian Online Explorer's writer Jason Clevett {{rated the}} entire event an 8 out of 10, which {{was higher than}} the 2006 event's rating of 6.5 out of 10. The NWA World Tag Team Championship bout was rated a 9 out of 10. The Ultimate X match for the TNA X Division Championship was rated a 10 out of 10. The Three Way Elimination match {{for a chance to}} {{challenge}} Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was rated a 5 out of 10, while main event was rated a 6 out of 10. Clevett stated in his review that he felt [...] "the crowd went home happy after the stellar Ultimate X bout". When commenting on the NWA World Tag Team Championship match he stated it was [...] "an awesome, awesome tag team match with insane crowd heat". He thought the main event was a [...] "decent match that was marred once again by an abundance of <b>overbooking</b> B.S. that seems to plague the main event scene of TNA."

50|$|These {{benefits}} {{arise from}} a wide range of management tools provided by online reservation systems, like operational reports, floor management software, customer reservation histories, and customer databases that include customer data and preferences, and grow with each new table booking. Restaurants will also be able to track cancellations, and manage walk-in and waitlists in a better way, eliminate <b>overbookings,</b> and create target email and postal mailings with the information from the customer database. Some online reservation systems include integrated email marketing tools.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, air {{passengers}} {{have more}} rights {{than in the}} US and must be compensated by law for <b>overbookings,</b> cancellations or flight delays. [...] After this law (Regulation 261/2004) {{was introduced in the}} EU in early 2005, complaints soared, as expected, since more compensation could be expected by passengers who officially complained. [...] In fact, complaints related to cancellations increased 600% and complaints related to delays increased 500%, not surprisingly since those are categories where increased compensation took effect since the new law.|$|R
50|$|When {{focused on}} {{controlling}} inventory, revenue management is mainly {{concerned with how}} best to price or allocate capacity. First, a company can discount products {{in order to increase}} volume. By lowering prices on products, a company can overcome weak demand and gain market share, which ultimately increases revenue. On the other hand, in situations where demand is strong for a product but the threat of cancellations looms (e.g. hotel rooms or airline seats), firms often overbook in order to maximize revenue from full capacity. <b>Overbooking's</b> focus is increasing the total volume of sales in the presence of cancellations rather than optimizing customer mix.|$|R
500|$|Lofgren {{continued}} to open shows, playing national songs on accordion. [...] Set lists further loosened, with many tour premieres {{showing up in}} request slots or elsewhere and shows sometimes running to 30 songs in length. [...] After a while, the encore break was disposed with and the show ran continuously to the end without the band ever leaving the stage. [...] Springsteen ran past local curfews at both Dublin shows and at Glastonbury. [...] The Dublin violations resulted in a potential €50,000 fine, but Springsteen mocked the prospect by on-staging a bit: “We have to go, we have a curfew!” with Van Zandt replying, “We don't care about the curfew, this is the curfew breaking Boss and E Street Band!" [...] "American Skin (41 Shots)" [...] made unexpected appearances in Dublin and at several stops in Italy, while [...] "My City of Ruins" [...] was played at Stadio Olimpico in Rome {{in honor of the}} victims of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. [...] The Western European leg ended with five shows in Spain, at more out-of-the-way locations than in the past. [...] The last of these shows, at the Auditorio Monte do Gozo in Santiago de Compostela, was marred by disorganized security and <b>overbooking</b> by the promoter, leaving some of the approximately 40,000 ticket holders unable to get in. [...] (Dozens of complaints against the promoter were filed to police, city, and consumer authorities the following day.) [...] In any event, the band played [...] "Rockin' All Over the World" [...] and concluded its encore with [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] after 1 a.m. local time (the Spanish shows did not begin until 10 p.m.). [...] Max Weinberg immediately flew back to Los Angeles and resumed his role on The Tonight Show later that same day.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1987, Senators Frank Lautenberg and Lowell Weicker sent {{a letter}} to Lorenzo {{questioning}} the decreased level of service, including delays, <b>overbooking,</b> cancellations, and bad communication.

40|$|Modern revenue {{managers}} understand, anticipate, {{and react}} to market demand to maximise their businesses’ revenues. They often {{do so by}} analysing, forecasting, and optimising their fixed, perishable inventory, and time-variable supply, through dynamic prices. Hence, the objective of pricing and revenue management is to stimulate demand from different customers to earn the maximum revenue from them. The essence of this discipline is to understand the customers' perceptions of value and to accurately align the right products to each customer segment. Therefore, this chapter suggests that revenue management systems combine data mining and operational research with strategy. Essentially, this involves maximising revenue {{from a combination of}} high-yield and price-sensitive customers; as these systems are intended to reduce seat spoilage and to increase load factors; thereby filling excess capacity. Moreover, these systems also manage <b>overbookings,</b> and are intended to minimise denied boarding. peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, AirHelp {{released}} AirHelp Pro, a {{new product}} designed to provide benefits to travelers regardless of their eligibility under EC 261 and other similar laws. It is an annual subscription service that provides cash and other perks to passengers who experience flight delays, cancellations, <b>overbookings,</b> and other air travel disruptions. The cash portion of the benefit is two-tiered, based on {{the severity of the}} travel disruption. “Everyday disruptions,” such as delays or missed connections, are eligible for $100 in cash benefits while being bumped or extended tarmac delays, also called “nightmare disruptions,” are worth $1,000. Cash benefits are paid immediately via bank transfer or PayPal once the flight in question is determined to be eligible {{under the terms of the}} program. Other benefits include access to the airport lounge while delayed and assistance with flight rebooking.Compensation under EC 261 or similar laws through AirHelp is separate from an AirHelp Pro membership. Customers can freely take advantage of both, if eligible.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a literature {{review of the}} main concepts of hotel revenue management (RM) and current state-of-the-art of its theoretical research. The article emphasises on the different directions of hotel RM research and is structured around {{the elements of the}} hotel RM system and the stages of RM process. The elements of the hotel RM system discussed in the paper include hotel RM centres (room division, F&B, function rooms, spa & fitness facilities, golf courses, casino and gambling facilities, and other additional services), data and information, the pricing (price discrimination, dynamic pricing, lowest price guarantee) and non-pricing (<b>overbookings,</b> length of stay control, room availability guarantee) RM tools, the RM software, and the RM team. The stages of RM process have been identified as goal setting, collection of data and information, data analysis, forecasting, decision making, implementation and monitoring. Additionally, special attention is paid to ethical considerations in RM practice, the connections between RM and customer relationship management, and the legal aspect of RM. Finally, the article outlines future research perspectives and discloses potential evolution of RM in future...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the BBC Watchdog {{programme}} highlighted Travelodge's {{policy of}} <b>overbooking</b> their hotels, turning guests away {{even when they}} have booked against a credit card.When a whistleblower revealed that <b>overbooking</b> comes before anything else, Travelodge admitted to this practice and updated their website to confirm this. Guests who are found in this position are where possible found accommodation in a nearby Travelodge {{at no extra cost}} to them, but if no rooms are available nearby the reservation is cancelled and the customer is refunded to the payee's card. Travelodge say that <b>overbooking</b> is so more guests can make use of rooms that would otherwise be empty; however, the whistleblower programme contained footage of an internal Travelodge training video which stated that their business model required them to run all their hotels at maximum capacity, and that a 'last man standing' policy would ensure this always occurred.|$|E

40|$|In a {{distributed}} database system, data {{is often}} replicated {{to improve performance}} and availability. By storing copies of shared data on processors where it is frequently accessed, the need for expensive, remote read accesses is decreased. By storing copies of critical data on processors with independent failure modes, the probability {{that at least one}} copy of the data will be accessible increases. In theory, data replication makes it possible to provide arbitrarily high data availability. In practice, realizing the benefits of data replication is difficult since the correctness of data must be maintained. One important aspect of correctness with replicated data is mutual consistency: all copies of the same logical data-item must agree on exactly one 2 ̆ 2 current value 2 ̆ 2 for the data-item. Furthermore, this value should 2 ̆ 2 make sense 2 ̆ 2 in terms of the transactions executed on copies of the data-item. When communication fails between sites containing copies of the same logical data-item, mutual consistency between copies becomes complicated to ensure. The most disruptive of these communication failures are partition failures, which fragment the network into isolated subnetworks called partitions. Unless partition failures are detected and recognized by all affected processors, independent and uncoordinated updates may be applied to different copies of the data, thereby compromising the correctness of data. Consider, for example, an Airline Reservation System implemented by a distributed database which splits into two partitions when the communication network fails. If, {{at the time of the}} failure, all the nodes have one seat remaining for PAN AM 537, reservations could be made in both partitions. This would violate correctness: who should get the last seat? There should not be more seats reserved for a flight than physically exist on the plane. (Some airlines do not implement this constraint and allow <b>overbookings.)</b> The design of a replicated data management algorithm tolerating partition failures (or partition processing strategy) is a notoriously hard problem. Typically, the cause or extent of a partition failure cannot be discerned by the processors themselves. At best, a processor may be able to identify the other processors in its partition; but, for the processors outside of its partition, it will not be able to distinguish between the case where those processors are simply isolated from it and the case where those processors are down. In addition, slow responses can cause the network to appear partitioned even when it is not, further complicating the design of a fault-tolerant algorithm...|$|R
50|$|In the {{transportation}} arena {{a company can}} {{increase the number of}} flights on routes, add more cars or consists to a train, move to a larger ship or add ships or containers to a cargo transport. In the telecommunications industry a common carrier may be able to solve an <b>overbooking</b> problem by adding bandwidth—either by adding lines to an existing system, reconfiguring existing lines, upgrading existing lines to a higher speed line or greater number of time-multiplexed lines, or some other scheme to add bandwidth. In the hotel industry, while revenue management teams commonly practice <b>overbooking,</b> they also work to ensure that hotels are not excessively overbooked resulting in negative brand perception and loss in profit.|$|E
