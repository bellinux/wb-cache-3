Theoretically, Germany could get American registration, hoist the U.S. flag on its merchant vessels, and avoid the British Blockade.

40|$|Abstract: Ex-vessel price {{formation}} {{of fish in}} Iceland has been a stumbling stone within the fisheries {{for a long period}} of time. Fish as a raw material for processing has been sold either in direct sales or through auction markets leading to different prices. In many cases direct sales leads to considerably lower prices then the outcome on the auction markets. In this context it is attempted in this paper to cast some light on this issue by analysing the development of the price systems applied in the industry. Furthermore, we apply theoretical methods of contract theory to gain understanding of how the share system and contracts between <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> on-shore facilities might influence the development of ex-vessel price of fish in Iceland. It is also discussed what problem of mesurement one has to tackle with when conducting empirical investigation of data regarding price of fish...|$|R
50|$|A {{charter party}} is the {{contract}} between the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> a <b>vessel</b> and the charterer for the use <b>of</b> a <b>vessel.</b> The charterer takes over the vessel for either {{a certain amount of}} time (a time charter) or for a certain point-to-point voyage (a voyage charter), giving rise to these two main types of charter agreement. There is a subtype of time charter called the demise or bareboat charter.|$|R

No doubt <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> that have been missing will call at the office to inspect the chronometers.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the Capital Construction Fund, a tax {{deferral}} program utilized for the construction <b>of</b> fishing <b>vessels,</b> is examined {{in the context of}} Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s fishing industry. It was believed that the Capital Construction Fund contributed to overcapitalization, was an incentive to purchase a vessel, and was mainly used by individuals targeting underutilized species. Indicators of capitalization such as number, size, and ages <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> owned were gathered from the <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> home-ported in Rhode Island during personal interviews. Response of those that have used the Program were separated from those who have not. A frequency analysis was utilized to determine if there were {{differences between the two groups}} regarding indicators of capitalization. Few major differences were found between the two groups. Thus, it was determined that the Capital Construction Fund does not contribute to overcapitalization, is not an incentive to purchase a new vessel, nor is it used predominantly by vessels that target underutilized species, in the Rhode Island fishing industry...|$|R
