5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> he does.|$|E

Hisar bus depot was established on 11 August 1969 and has a subdepot at Hansi. As of 2012, the depot has a total of 198 buses with daily ridership of 73,500.

Auto rickshaws are a major means of transport for travelling within the city. In August 2012, city bus service was started in the city.

5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E

Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping. He stands up again, {{takes hold of}} the ring, and finds {{that it has become}} loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his word <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> {{the surface of}} it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if he lit the bat on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the barbed wire baseball bat to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Part of Johnson's {{campaign}} for relief was {{the abolition of}} the practice of debt imprisonment nationwide. It would take him nearly ten years to see this goal accomplished. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, introducing a bill to end the practice, and pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate, but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E

She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E
