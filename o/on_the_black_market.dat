5|$|As {{in every}} fiscal emergency, hard currency, {{particularly}} the United States dollar, has long {{served as a}} parallel currency <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> and many prices in shops would be posted in US dollars, even during periods when it was illegal to possess foreign currency or to transact business in US dollars.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} sinking of a British warship in Chinese waters, the theft {{of one of the}} ship's cruise missiles—and the {{shooting}} down of a Chinese fighter plane.

25|$|Food {{was always}} had locally, taxed away from peasants, {{purchased}} or even grown by Liberation Army units. Captured stocks were also exploited.

50|$|Dust is a drug, smuggled from {{system to}} system in ways common to high-value/low-weight-and-bulk contraband. It trades at high prices and margins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>markets,</b> and is as hotly pursued by law enforcers {{in the way}} opiates are today. Implications are that if one is caught in {{possession}} or dealing, the penalties are quite harsh. Many <b>black</b> <b>market</b> operators refuse to deal dust because of the risks posed by law enforcement.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration {{were involved in the}} black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> which can be a health hazard.|$|E

50|$|While outside {{material}} was {{vital to the}} war effort, much of the resources needed were obtained inside South Vietnam. Tonnages needed for communist forces were modest for the low-intensity protracted war style. One Central Intelligence Agency study in 1966 found {{that the bulk of}} supplies needed were generated within South Vietnam.Food was always had locally, taxed away from peasants, purchased or even grown by Liberation Army units. Captured stocks were also exploited. American logistical largesse also provided a bonanza as fraud and corruption siphoned off resources.

5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac, and sell them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market.</b> The egg trade has been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in Limón say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{banking system}} of Belarus {{consists}} of two level: Central Bank (National Bank of the Republic of Belarus) and 25 commercial banks. On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars, euros, durable goods, and canned goods. On 1 June 2011, Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to their Hohokam and Ancestral Pueblo {{neighbors to the}} north, the Mogollons usually buried their dead. The culture's graves often included ceramic art and semiprecious stones. Because the Mogollon burial sites displayed such wealth, they were often looted by grave robbers who sought to sell their spoils <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archaeological <b>black</b> <b>market.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nicomorphine {{may appear}} on rare {{occasions}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European <b>black</b> <b>market</b> and other channels for unsupervised opioid users.

5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|However, {{too many}} horses and mules died of {{diseases}} or old age {{before they even}} reached the battlefield and the army ordered an inquiry. In 1917, Vizzini was sentenced to 20 years in first instance for fraud, corruption and murder, but he was absolved thanks to powerful friends who exonerated him. He made his fortune <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> during World War I, and expanded his activities to the sulphur mines. As a representative of a consortium of sulphur mine operators, Vizzini participated in high-level meetings in Rome and London concerning government subsidies and tariffs, next to such men as Guido Donegani of Montecatini chemical industries and , Finance minister during Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime.|$|E
5000|$|Unsure of {{his career}} path, Haas {{realized}} that photography could provide both a means of support and a vehicle for communicating his ideas.

5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E
5|$|Slayer {{returned}} as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour tickets fetched up to 1,000 Deutschmark ($680 USD) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market.</b> With {{the popularity of}} American thrash at its peak, the tour was extended to the US beginning in May 1991, with Megadeth, Anthrax and opening act Alice in Chains. The band released a double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E

Pastorius was fully {{established}} as sole band bass player for the recording of Heavy Weather (Columbia, 1977), which contained the Grammy-nominated hit [...] "Birdland".|$|R
50|$|The Free Syrian Army later began {{manufacturing}} its own mortars and rockets. Raids {{on government}} checkpoints and arms depots {{are carried out}} to supply the FSA with much of its ammunition and new arms. The FSA also purchases weapons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Syrian <b>black</b> <b>market</b> which is supplied by arms smugglers from neighboring countries and corrupt loyalist forces selling government arms.|$|R
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs}} of the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E
25|$|When {{red mercury}} first {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> international <b>black</b> <b>market</b> 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because {{it came from}} Russia. When it resurfaced {{last year in the}} formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury's stock in trade.|$|R

It is the C17β enanthate ester and a long-acting prodrug of trenbolone (19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone). Trenbolone enanthate is used in scientific research and has been sold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internet <b>black</b> <b>market</b> as a designer steroid for bodybuilders.|$|R
