50|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> must be {{designed}} to produce directional solidification, which sweeps from <b>the</b> extremities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mold cavity toward the riser(s). In this way, the riser can feed molten metal continuously to part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> that is solidifying. One part of achieving this end is by placing the riser near the thickest and largest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting,</b> as that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> will cool and solidify last. If this type of solidification is not possible, multiple risers that feed various sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> or chills may be necessary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Casting {{process of}} heavy section ductile iron wind {{generator}} rotor shaft was simulated by finite element software ProCAST. Gating systems was designed according to <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting.</b> Solidification behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> was then analyzed. Defects, especially porosity, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> during solidification were predicted and hence casting process optimization has been performed {{based on the}} simulation results {{in order to avoid}} porosity in <b>the</b> <b>casting.</b> Results show that solidification time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> is more than 14 h when cooled in sand mold. Porosity easily formed at the thermal center and in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> flange. Solidification time is evidently decreased with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> chills.
