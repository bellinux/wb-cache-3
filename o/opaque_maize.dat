40|$|Eleven exotic {{populations of}} <b>opaque</b> <b>maize</b> from Brazil. Bolívia and Chile, were characterized. Kernels density, lysine and {{tryptophan}} contents, total zeins and non-zeins, zein individual fractions, and soluble sugars were analyzed. Although these populations bear soft endosperm, their zein prolifes by gel electrophoresis, the nutritional {{quality of their}} proteins {{as well as the}} densities of their grains do not follow the patterns present in other <b>opaque</b> <b>maize</b> genotypes. We concluded that these exotic populations are not included in any class of endosperm mutant described so far. 199...|$|E
40|$|The <b>maize</b> <b>Opaque</b> 2 (O 2) {{protein is}} a basic leucine zipper {{transcription}} factor that controls the expression of distinct classes of endosperm genes through the recognition of different cis-acting elements in their promoters. The O 2 target region in the promoter of the alpha-coixin gene was analyzed in detail and shown to comprise two closely adjacent binding sites, named O 2 u and O 2 d, which are related in sequence to the GCN 4 binding site. Quantitative DNase footprint analysis indicated that O 2 binding to alpha-coixin target sites is best described by a cooperative model. Transient expression assays showed that the two adjacent sites act synergistically. This synergy is mediated in part by cooperative DNA binding. In tobacco protoplasts, O 2 binding at the O 2 u site is more important for enhancer activity than is binding at the O 2 d site, suggesting that {{the architecture of the}} O 2 -DNA complex is important for interaction with the transcriptional machinery...|$|R
40|$|The <b>maize</b> <b>Opaque</b> 2 (O 2) {{protein is}} a "leucine zipper" DNA binding factor that {{interacts with the}} {{sequence}} TCCACGTAGA in the promoters of the 22 -kD alpha-zein genes and activates its transcription. A completely different consensus sequence (GATGAPyPuTGPu) identified in b- 32, a gene that encodes an abundant albumin that is also under control of the O 2 locus, can also be bound by the O 2 protein. We showed that the gene encoding the 22 -kD-like alpha-coixin, the alpha-prolamin of the maize-related grass Coix, can also be transactivated by the O 2 protein. A binding assay in vitro and footprint analysis demonstrated that the GACATGTC sequence of the alpha-coixin promoter can be recognized and protected by the maize O 2 protein. Employing transient expression experiments in immature maize endosperm and tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, we demonstrated that the O 2 protein can activate expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene placed {{under the control of}} the 22 -kD-like alpha-coixin promoter. We also demonstrated that a 22 -kD-like alpha-coixin pseudogene promoter is transactivated by the maize O 2 protein...|$|R
40|$|Maize has poor {{nutritional}} value due to deficiency of two {{essential amino acids}} - tryptophan and lysine. Although recessive opaque 2 (o 2) mutation significantly increases their content in the endosperm, incorporation of opaque 2 into high yielding cultivars was not commercially successful, because of its numerous agronomic and processing problems due to soft endosperm. Quality protein maize - QPM has lately been introduced as <b>opaque</b> 2 <b>maize</b> with improved endosperm hardness and improved agronomic traits, but mostly within tropical and subtropical germplasm. The ongoing breeding project at MRI includes improvement of MRI opaque 2 lines and conversion of standard lines to QPM germplasm. The main selection steps in QPM breeding involve assessing kernel modifications and tryptophan level in each generation. Herein, we present {{the results of the}} analysis for these traits on F 3 and BC 1 F 1 generations of QPM x opaque 2, opaque 2 x QPM and standard lines x QPM crosses. The results showed that the majority the genotypes had kernel types 2 and 3 (good modifications). The whole grain tryptophan content in F 3 and BC 1 F 1 genotypes of crosses between QPM and opaque 2 germplasm was at the quality protein level, with a few exceptions. All BC 1 F 1 genotypes of standard lines x QPM had tryptophan content in the range of normal maize, while majority of F 3 genotypes had tryptophan content at level of QPM. The progeny (with increased tryptophan levels) of QPM and opaque 2 crosses had significantly higher tryptophan content compared to the progeny of crosses between standard and QPM lines - 0. 098 to 0. 114 and 0. 080, respectively. All genotypes that had poorly modified kernels and/or low tryptophan content will be discarded from further breeding...|$|R
40|$|Maize {{protein is}} {{deficient}} in two essential amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. Naturally occurring opaque 2 (o 2) mutation {{which increases the}} levels of tryptophan and lysine in the grain also confers an undesirable phenotype leading to low yields and more susceptible, soft and chalky kernels. Quality Protein Maize (QPM) is agronomically acceptable and nutritionally improved <b>opaque</b> 2 <b>maize.</b> Marker assisted selection increases reliability and efficiency, reduces time and costs taken to obtain QPM. The results {{presented in this paper}} {{are a part of the}} Maize Research Insitute project on conversion of normal maize lines to QPM lines adapted for growing in temperate regions trough marker assisted backcross (MAB). Genetic and biochemical variability was analyzed between normal (ZPL 5) and QPM (CML 144) parental inbred lines and the efficiency of the three opaque 2 specific SSR markers was examined. Markers phi 057 and umc 1066 can discriminate homozygous and heterozygous backcross progeny, thus can be used as foreground selection markers for the opaque 2 gene. The genetic similarity between analyzed lines was 0. 05, which confirmed good selection of parental lines for the creation of hybrids. Tryptophan content was 0. 093 and QI was 0. 85 in CML 144, approximately twice as high compared to 0. 054 and 0. 48 in ZPL 5. Both tryptophan and QI values for CML 144 were above the QPM treshold, i. e. tryptophan for 24 % and QI for 0. 625 %, making it a suitable donor line of o 2. These results represent the framework for marker assisted introgression of the quality protein trait into local maize genotype. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|For human {{nutrition}} {{the main source}} of vegetable proteins are cereal and legume seeds. The content of total soluble amino acids in mature endosperm of wild-type, <b>opaque</b> and floury <b>maize</b> (Zea mays L.) mutants were determined by HPLC. The total absolute concentration of soluble amino acids among the mutants varied depending on the mutant. The o 11 and o 13 mutants exhibited the highest average content, whereas o 10, fl 3 and fl 1 exhibited the lowest average content. In general, the mutants exhibited similar concentrations of total soluble amino acids when compared to the wild-type lines, with the clear exception of mutants o 11 and fl 1, with the o 11 mutant exhibiting a higher concentration of total soluble amino acids when compared to its wild-type counterpart W 22 and the fl 1 mutant a lower concentration when compared to its wild-type counterpart Oh 43. For methionine, the mutants o 2 and o 11 and wild-type Oh 43 exhibited the highest concentrations of this amino acid. Significant differences were not observed between mutants for other amino acids such as lysine and threonine. The high lysine concentrations obtained originally for these mutants {{may be due to the}} amino acids incorporated into storage proteins, but not those present in the soluble form...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{the amino}} acids {{tyrosine}} and phenylalanine are synthesized from arogenate by arogenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydratase, respectively, with the relative flux to each being tightly controlled. Here {{the characterization of}} a <b>maize</b> <b>opaque</b> endosperm mutant (mto 140), which also shows retarded vegetative growth, is described The opaque phenotype co-segregates with a Mutator transposon insertion in an arogenate dehydrogenase gene (zmAroDH- 1) and {{this led to the}} characterization of the four-member family of maize arogenate dehydrogenase genes (zmAroDH- 1 –zmAroDH- 4) which share highly similar sequences. A Mutator insertion at an equivalent position in AroDH- 3, the most closely related family member to AroDH- 1, is also associated with opaque endosperm and stunted vegetative growth phenotypes. Overlapping but differential expression patterns as well as subtle mutant effects on the accumulation of tyrosine and phenylalanine in endosperm, embryo, and leaf tissues suggest that the functional redundancy of this gene family provides metabolic plasticity for the synthesis of these important amino acids. mto 140 /arodh- 1 seeds shows a general reduction in zein storage protein accumulation and an elevated lysine phenotype typical of other opaque endosperm mutants, but it is distinct because it does not result from quantitative or qualitative defects in the accumulation of specific zeins but rather from a disruption in amino acid biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|High yield, but a poor {{protein source}} Thanks to the {{development}} of hybrid varieties in the 1950 s, corn has become the most productive major crop species in the United States. On a per acreage basis, corn yield exceeds that of the other two major crops, wheat and soybean, by 2 - to 3 -fold. However, the nutritional quality of corn protein in these high yielding hybrids remains relatively poor due to its deficiency in essential amino acids, such as lysine. The focus of corn breeding on yield, which has resulted in a shift in grain composition from protein to starch 1, has compounded this nutritional deficiency. As a major food and feed staple crop, corn is a poor protein source in both quality and quantity. Advancements in agricultural biotechnology may help improve the nutritional quality of corn protein, starting with lysine enhancement. Strategies for lysine genetic engineering in corn Corn is mainly used as animal feed in developed countries. The most limiting amino acid in corn-based feed is lysine, and this insufficiency is overcome by supplementing corn meal with soybean meal or crystalline lysine produced via fermentation. To broaden the use of corn meal, several transgenic approaches have been investigated — at least two examples of genetically engineered high lysine corn have been successfully demonstrated in field-grown inbred crops.

40|$|Efficiency {{in plant}} {{breeding}} is determined {{primarily by the}} ability to screen for genetic polymorphism, productivity and yield stability early in program. Dependent on the knowledge about the biochemical bases of the trait and nature of its genetic control, trait could be modified either through mutagenesis of genes controlling it or through the transfer of already existing mutant genes, controlling desired trait to different plant genotypes by classic crossing. Objective of this report is to present partly results on {{the investigation of the}} possibilities to apply ionizing radiations (fast neutrons, γ -rays) and chemical mutagens (EI, iPMS, EMS, ENU) to get maize and wheat mutants with increased amount and improved protein quality. Besides this approach in mutation breeding, results on the very early investigation of biochemical background of opaque - 2 mutation including use of coupled cell - free RNA and protein synthesis containing components from both wild and <b>opaque</b> - 2 <b>maize</b> genotypes (chromatin, RNA polymerase, microsomall fraction, protein bodies) will be presented. Partial results on opaque - 2 gene incorporation in different genetic background are reviewed. Part of report is dealing with different classes of molecular markers (proteins, RFLP, AFLP, RAPD, and SSR) application in maize genome polymorphism investigation. Besides application of different molecular markers classes in the investigation of heterosis phenomena they are useful in biochemical pathway of important traits control determination as well. ...|$|R

This suggests that other {{factors contribute to}} kernel texture. A liquid chromatography approach coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics {{was used to compare}} non-zein proteins of nearly isogenic opaque endosperm mutants. In total, 2762 proteins were identified that were enriched for biological processes such as protein transport and folding, amino acid biosynthesis, and proteolysis. Principal component analysis and pathway enrichment suggested that the mutants partitioned into three groups: (i) Mc, DeB 30, fl 2 and o 2; (ii) o 1; and (iii) fl 1. Indicator species analysis revealed mutant-specific proteins, and highlighted ER secretory pathway components that were enriched in selected groups of mutants. The most significantly changed proteins were related to stress or defense and zein partitioning into the soluble fraction for Mc, DeB 30, o 1, and fl 1 specifically. In silico dissection of the most significantly changed proteins revealed novel qualitative changes in lysine abundance contributing to the overall lysine increase and the nutritional rebalancing of the o 2 and fl 2 endosperm...|$|R
40|$|Cereal {{seeds are}} {{deficient}} in certain amino acids, in particular lysine. Biochemical, molecular and genetic studies have increased our knowledge concerning {{the regulation of}} the aspartate pathway, which synthesises lysine. Among the enzymes involved in lysine metabolism, aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) control the regulation of lysine biosynthesis, whereas lysine: 2 -oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), {{have been shown to}} {{play a key role in}} the breakdown of lysine. Lysine overproduction can be obtained by altering the sensitivity of DHDPS to lysine, but accumulation of this amino acid in cereal seeds requires further manipulation of LOR and/or SDH. These latter two enzymes have been shown to be specific to the endosperm tissue and their activities are drastically reduced in the high-lysine mutants of maize. We have isolated, purified and characterized the enzymes AK, HSDH, LOR and SDH from rice and coix seeds. The results indicate that the regulation of the LOR activity is complex and involves a calcium-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. We analysed the activity of the enzymes involved in lysine metabolism, characterized the storage proteins and determined the soluble lysine content for several <b>opaque</b> and floury <b>maize</b> mutants and show that only some of the mutants are similar to the well studied opaque- 2 mutant. The results suggest that lysine accumulation in maize seeds cannot be explained by an increase in soluble lysine, but may be mainly due to an altered storage protein composition...|$|R
40|$|Cereal storage {{proteins}} {{are major}} nitrogen sources for humans and livestock. Prolamins {{are the most}} abundant storage protein in most cereals. They are deposited into protein bodies (PBs) in seed endosperm. The inner structure and the storage mechanism for prolamin PBs is poorly understood. <b>Maize</b> <b>opaque</b> 10 (o 10) is a classic opaque endosperm mutant with misshapen PBs. Through positional cloning, we found that O 10 encodes a novel cereal-specific PB protein. Its middle domain contains a seven-repeat sequence {{that is responsible for}} its dimerization. Its C terminus contains a transmembrane motif that is required for its ER localization and PB deposition. A cellular fractionation assay indicated that O 10 is initially synthesized in the cytoplasm and then anchored to the ER and eventually deposited in the PB. O 10 can interact with 19 -kD and 22 -kD α-zeins and 16 -kD and 50 -kD γ-zeins through its N-terminal domain. An immunolocalization assay indicated that O 10 co-localizes with 16 -kD γ-zein and 22 -kD α-zein in PBs, forming a ring-shaped structure at the interface between the α-zein-rich core and the γ-zein-rich peripheral region. The loss of O 10 function disrupts this ring-shaped distribution of 22 -kD and 16 -kD zeins, resulting in misshapen PBs. These results showed that O 10, as a newly evolved PB protein, is essential for the ring-shaped distribution of 22 -kD and 16 -kD zeins and controls PB morphology in maize endosperm...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of two <b>maize</b> <b>opaque</b> endosperm mutants (o 1 and o 2) and two floury (fl 1 and fl 2) to accumulate lysine in the seed {{in relation to}} their wild type counterparts Oh 43 + was examined. The highest total lysine content was 3. 78 % in the o 2 mutant and the lowest 1. 87 % in fl 1, as compared with the wild type (1. 49 %). For soluble lysine, o 2 exhibited over a 700 % increase, whilst for fl 3 a 28 % decrease was encountered, as compared with the wild type. In order to understand the mechanisms causing these large variations in both total and soluble lysine content, a quantitative and qualitative study of the N constituents of the endosperm has been carried out and data obtained for the total protein, nonprotein N, soluble amino acids, albumins/globulins, zeins and glutelins present in the seed of the mutants. Following two-dimensional PAGE separation, a total of 35 different forms of zein polypeptides were detected and considerable differences were noted between the five different lines. In addition, two enzymes of the aspartate biosynthetic pathway, aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase were analyzed with respect to feedback inhibition by lysine and threonine. The activities of the enzymes lysine 2 -oxoglutate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase, both involved in lysine degradation in the maize endosperm were also determined and shown to be reduced several fold with the introduction of the o 2, fl 1 and fl 2 mutations in the Oh 43 + inbred line, whereas wild-type activity levels were verified in the Oh 43 o 1 mutant...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to identify the major social and economic obstacles to the introduction and expansion of the production, marketing and human consumption of <b>Opaque</b> - 2 <b>maize</b> in Colombia, to determine under what circumstances such an introduction and expansion might be feasible, and to suggest possible roles for science government and private enterprise in such a program. Two ways to introduce and expand the human consumption of Opaque- 2 maize were considered: (1) consumption of the product by maize-buying consumers, i. e., consumption based on commercial production, and (2) consumption on the farm of home-grown Opaque- 2 maize. It may be concluded that a rapid expansion of commercial production of Opaque- 2 maize for direct human consumption is not feasible {{at the time of the}} study without considerable government subsidy. Promotion of Opaque- 2 maize for home consumption among small farmers may be successful at low costs to the government. The obstacles to a rapid expansion of commercial production and consumption of Opaque- 2 maize are primarily associated with its softness and appearance. Hence, research emphasis is needed to develop a flint type high lysine maize. Seven potentially key factors which might influence the results of efforts to introduce and expand the production and consumption of Opaque- 2 maize were considered in the study. Furthermore, a number of alternative public policy measures which could be applied by the Colombian government with respect to Opaque- 2 maize were outlined. Five surveys carried out among maize producers, marketing agencies and consumers furnished basic data for quantitative analyses to estimate the importance of each of the potential key factors and how they might be varied to create conditions favorable to the production and consumption of Opaque- 2 maize...|$|R
