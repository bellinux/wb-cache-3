The rehabilitation technique {{is based on the}} use of a geocomposite and of an overlay made of a special <b>open-graded</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> filled with mortar. The research consisted of the development of a Finite Element Model able to analyze the response of the rehabilitation system over the cracked slabs. The technique was then tested through two fullscale tests. The first field test section was aimed at defining the best construction procedure. The second one was carried out in airport to directly evaluate the response under traffic. Tests were performed to quantify the increase of the structural and functional performance of the pavement after the rehabilitation. Finally, the methodology was applied in a real case, on a wide scale (about 120000 m 2) at two Italian airports...|$|E
40|$|Permeable Friction Courses (PFC) are <b>open-graded</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{placed over}} an {{impervious}} base. The interconnected air voids allow rainwater to drain into the pavement thus providing a safer driving surface in wet weather {{and a filter}} for highway runoff. This report summarizes {{the current state of}} the practice related to the hydraulic properties, water quality benefits, and maintenance of PFC based on literature from around the world. Porous pavements reduce pollutant concentrations in the highway runoff during the functional service life of the pavement, which ultimately results in the clogging of the pavement. This material accumulating in the pores was found to have high concentrations of pollutants, such as heavy metals. Pavement cleaning machines used in Europe to remove accumulated pollutants are described and usually found to maintain the function of the pavements. Existing research also includes measurements of hydraulic conductivity over time and from different pavements. In winter conditions, more maintenance is required for PFCs than for conventional pavements since the air voids change with ambient air temperature casing the PFC to freeze faster than conventional pavement. Other beneficial properties of PFCs, such as the friction coefficient and noise reduction ability, are also described...|$|R

Their role is investigated through a comparative laboratory investigation of materials used worldwide: hot mix asphalts (HMAs) and Portland cement concrete (PCC). In addition, the investigation also considers a relatively new material made of an <b>open-grade</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> filled with cement mortar, in literature known as grouted macadam (GM). The comparison is carried out by developing an experimental plan with four main goals: assessment {{of the effect of}} fire exposure, evaluation of the effect of exposure to high temperatures, measurement of the decay of mechanical characteristics as a result of fire and exposure to high temperatures, and assessment of the types and concentration of smoke emitted during fire exposure. Results from the investigation led to the conclusion that HMA is the least suitable material for tunnel applications as it showed the worst performance in all four test categories.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted with the purposeof determining {{the applicability of the}} Hveem Stabilometer to the testing of <b>open-graded</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The study was divided into two major sections. The first of these investigated the validity of the Stabilometer displacement measurement when applied to open-graded specimens having large surface air voids. The second portion of the study had two specific purposes: (l) to investigate the stress-strain characteristics of open-graded mixturestested in the Hveem Stabilometer and (2) to determine whether surface voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens influenced Hveem stability values. To check the validity of the displacement measurement, Stabilometertests were, conducted over a wide range of displacement values forduplicate specimens molded from three different mixtures. Displacement readings were varied by altering the surfaces of test specimens andby adjusting the quantity of air inside the Stabilometer oil chamber. In studying the stress-strain characteristics of open-graded mixes, Stabilometer values and specimen deformation readings were obtained for two mixtures. The first of these open-type mixes was well-graded, but the second was essentially 2 ̆ 2 one-sized 2 ̆ 2 in gradation. Results of this investigation showed that the final displacement value, when substituted into the Hveem stability equation, did notcompensate for the variations in lateral pressure caused by large changes(one or more turns) in the final displacement measurement. Stress-strain relationships for the well-graded, open-type mixture indicated that the quantity of strain permitted a Stabilometer test specimen conformed closely with the amount of strain developed at the maximum shearing strength of a rational triaxial test specimen subjected to confining pressures similar to those present in a Stabilometer test. Strain measurements recorded for Stabilometer specimens of the one-sized mixture used in this study were much lower than those obtained at the peak value of shearing resistance for triaxial test specimens ofthe same mixture and for similar confining pressures. Surface air voids on the ends of Stabilometer test specimens hada small effect on test results. When these voids were filled, Hveem stability values were not significantly higher, but the reproducibility of test results was greatly improved by coating test specimens. To improve the consistency of Stabilometer test results obtainedfrom open-graded mixtures, certain modifications in the testing technique were suggested. These changes involved the filling of air voids on thesurface of test specimens and the admittance of an increased amount of air in the Stabilometer oil chamber during the calibration of the testing apparatu...|$|R

The use of the retained strength ratios obtained from laboratory moisture damage tests is a useful tool in making quantitative predictions of the related damage caused by water. This study involved laboratory work on the effect of water on the performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Comparisons are made between the performances of Hot-rolled Asphalt (HRA) <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing base bitumen of 50 pen grade to that of a polymer-fibre reinforced HRA mixture.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{bituminous}} hot-mix recycling in plant {{has been used}} in several road pavement rehabilitation cases in Portugal. From the environmental and economical point of view, this practice is generally recognized as an efficient technique. Therefore, an increase in the production and application of reclaimed <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> in hot plant is expected in Portugal, in the next years. Generally, the mix design procedures in use for usual <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> may be adapted for hot-mix recycled in plant (HMR).

Fibres may be used as additives to modify <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> by fastening a significant amount of bitumen, what allows the increase of the binder content of the mixtures without losing their resistance to permanent deformation.

Most of single load application tests were carried out by means of flexure; and the mode of failure, relationships between strength vs. temperature, strain at failure vs. temperature, and stiffness at failure vs. temperature were obtained; and convergence of the strain in ductile failure zone, (2 ~ 5) × 10 ^[- 2], and in the brittle failure zone, (1 ~ 2) × 10 ^[- 3], was obtained. As a result of beam flexure tests, the movement of the transition point at which the mode of failure showed a change in the mode from brittle to ductile was observed.

40|$|The RAP (Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement) {{utilization}} in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{highlights the}} need to evaluate the effects RAP binder produces in terms of stiffness and brittleness increase. The research {{is focused on the}} evaluation of the mechanical properties of a <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> containing a significant percentage of RAP and produced with a controlled viscosity bitumen. Both the fresh and the RAP binder have been characterized at low temperatures by the BBR. The research has pointed out a general increase in stiffness induced by the RAP binder, but the mixture maintains a good workability even if the fatigue resistance is lightly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Water-related {{damage to}} {{bituminous}} pavement {{is considered to}} result from penetration of liquid water from the surface and/or subsurface. However, surface courses made of bituminous material such as runway pavements are usually not permeable for liquid water. Therefore, such phenomena {{may be caused by}} moisture vapor in the air. A new moisture permeation test apparatus was developed to analyze the mass transfer. Moisture permeation tests under typical hot summer conditions suggested that atmospheric moisture permeates and accumulates in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> through mass transfer by vapor diffusion despite the water impermeability of <b>bituminous</b> surface <b>mixtures.</b> The moisture permeation test provides an effective approach to analyze water storage mechanisms and moisture-related phenomena such as blistering in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures,</b> although the test apparatus and condition settings require some improvement. 水分による歴青系舗装の損傷は，表面や路床から液状浸入した水が原因であると考えられてきた。しかし，滑走路等のアスファルト舗装表層は実質的に不透水であることが多い。したがって，著者らは大気中の水蒸気（湿気）がこれらの要因であると考え，この検証のために新しい透湿試験装置を開発した。透湿試験から，たとえ表層材料が実質的に不透水性であっても，典型的な夏の暑い日の気象条件においては水蒸気透過による物質移動により大気中の水分が透過し，凝縮した水分が混合物中に多量に蓄積しうることが明らかとなった。試験装置や試験条件に関してさらなる改良を加えることが必要であるものの，透湿試験は水分蓄積メカニズムの解明とブリスタリング現象等の水分に関連する損傷を評価する有効な試験方法である。Research Not...|$|R
40|$|The time-temperature {{superposition}} principle (TTSP) {{is known to}} be valid in the small strain domain where the behaviour of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> is linear viscoelastic (LVE). The behaviour is then called thermorheologically simple. In this work, an experimental campaign was performed at University of Lyon/ENTPE (France) to check the validity of the TTSP in the linear domain in the tridimensional case and also when cracks occur and propagate in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture.</b> A four-point bending test, which has been designed at University of Lyon/ENTPE, was used as crack propagation test. First, a complex modulus test is performed on cylindrical specimen in the LVE domain. Then, a series of crack propagation tests are carried out at different temperatures and different imposed displacement rates. The same shift factors obtained for master curve of complex modulus is also applied for the crack propagation tests analysis. The results allow obtaining a unique curve, for identical loadings when plotting as a function of reduced time. This result confirms that the TTSP is also valid for crack propagation in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a comparative laboratory investigation on the mechanical performance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> for pavement base courses, made with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Five Asphalt Concretes (AC) were used in this study: a control AC mixture with limestone aggregates and two AC mixtures with 20 and 40 % RAP (by weight of aggregate) respectively. The RAP material used came from two different sources, one from Italy and one from Greece. The mix design procedure was based on the optimization of the volumetric properties and the moisture resistance of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Then, the stiffness modulus of the mixtures was evaluated by the Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus test, at various temperatures and rise times. The Indirect Tensile Fatigue Test, concluded the experimental trial. Depending on the RAP sources and content, the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> made with RAP aggregates showed improved indirect tensile strength as well as higher stiffness modulus values and fatigue resistance, with respect to the control asphalt concrete prepared with natural aggregate. © RILEM 201...|$|R
