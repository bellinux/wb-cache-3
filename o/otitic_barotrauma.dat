40|$|During {{the period}} April 1965 to April 1968 {{observations}} {{were made on}} 285 patients and 357 staff exposed to air and oxygen at pressures of 1 to 3 atmospheres absolute in a hyperbaric unit. Decompression sickness was not noted and an annual radiological skeletal survey failed to show aseptic bone necrosis; the incidence of <b>otitic</b> <b>barotrauma</b> was 4 Â· 7 %. Oxygen toxicity was not observed in any patient. It is suggested that pressures in this range are relatively safe in a specialized medical hyperbaric environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Nasopharyngeal cancer {{commonly}} manifests with cervical lymphadenopathy, recurrent epistaxis {{and progressive}} nasal obstruction. Neuro-ophthalmic and otologic manifestations can also occur. Isolated otologic presentations of nasopharyngeal cancer are rare and {{the diagnosis of}} nasopharyngeal cancer may not be foremost {{in the list of}} differentials. Case presentation We present the case of a 29 -year-old Nigerian woman with bilateral conductive hearing loss and tinnitus after air travel. There were no other symptoms. The persistence of the symptoms after adequate treatment for <b>otitic</b> <b>barotrauma</b> necessitated re-evaluation, which led to a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer. Conclusion Isolated otologic manifestations of nasopharyngeal cancer are rare in regions with low incidence of the disease. There is a need for it to be considered as a possible differential in patients presenting with bilateral serous otitis media. </p...|$|E
