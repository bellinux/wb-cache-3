5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{historian}} Frantz Funck-Brentano used the archives to undertake detailed research into the operation of the Bastille, focusing on the upper class prisoners in the Bastille, disproving many of the 18th-century myths about the institution and portraying the prison in a favourable light. Modern historians today consider Funck-Brentano's work slightly biased by his anti-Republican views, but his histories of the Bastille were highly influential and were largely responsible for establishing that the Bastille was a well-run, relatively benign institution. Historian Fernand Bournon used the same archive material to produce the Histoire de la Bastille in 1893, considered by modern historians {{to be one of the}} best and most balanced 19th-century histories of the Bastille. These works inspired the writing of a sequence of more popular histories of the Bastille in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Auguste Coeuret's anniversary history of the Bastille, which typically focused <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> themes and stories involving the more glamorous prisoners from the upper classes of French society.|$|E

25|$|The album's sound {{continued}} Isis' {{legacy of}} lengthy songwriting, and presents a slight {{departure from the}} soft-loud dynamics which characterised previous releases. Critical appraisal was largely positive; it went on to place well <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> best-of lists {{at the close of}} the year. Commercially, it was Isis' most successful release ever, breaching the Billboard 200 for the first time and gaining international chart presence.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Hayakawa's {{on-screen}} roles {{can best}} be described as the honorable villain, a figure exemplified by his portrayal of Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the role. After that film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting. Throughout the following years he performed guest appearances <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> television shows and films, making his final performance in the animated film The Daydreamer (1966).|$|E

25|$|The G.I. Bill {{guaranteed}} {{low cost}} loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, {{the opportunity to}} buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization – for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves, allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000.

25|$|Unlike the king, Frederick was a {{knowledgeable}} amateur of painting, who patronised immigrant artists like Jacopo Amigoni and Jean Baptiste Vanloo, who painted the {{portraits of the}} prince and his consort for Frederick's champion William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. The list of other artists he employed—Philip Mercier, John Wootton, George Knapton and the French engraver Joseph Goupy—represents some of the principal painterly figures of the English Rococo. The Prince was also crucially important for furthering {{the popularity of the}} Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen, patronising silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), toyshop owners like Paul Bertrand and carver and gilders, the most notable being Paul Petit (1729–c.1756) who first worked for the prince on William Kent's neo-Palladian state barge of 1732, which is still preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Petit worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick that are among the most significant remaining testaments to his patronage of the decorative arts. One frame made for his namesake cousin in 1748, Frederick the Great of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the Prince held his cousin, suggesting the Prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, over that of his own father George II. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by Antoine Pense, and remains today in the British Royal Collection.|$|E

50|$|After 1949 {{the party}} also greatly altered the {{character}} of the legal profession. A number of law schools were closed, and most of the teachers were retired.

From the beginning these two groups disagreed over legal policy, and the development of the legal system reflected their continuous debate over both form and substance.|$|R
25|$|Very little housing {{had been}} built during the Great Depression and World War, except for {{emergency}} quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended {{on the availability of}} automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas, an average of 316,000 new housing non-farm units should have been constructed 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 annually from 1946 through 1955. The G.I.
