5000|$|Historically, Franklins never advertised due to {{it being}} a [...] "no-frills" [...] supermarket. Instead, it advertised {{specials}} at the stores, much like Aldi does now. Later, it advertised through their own catalogues, especially when it introduced fresh foods and liquor to its stores. But it was in 1998 when Franklins launched its first TV advertisement with the slogan [...] "More in your trolley for less". Ironically, its rivals Woolworths and BI-LO launched their first advertisements {{around the same time}} and Coles was also given a new slogan, also at the same time. Shortly after Dairy Farm International exited the business in 2001, Franklins' advertisements used the slogan [...] "Saves You Money".In 2002, the new Franklins was launched with the slogan [...] "Look at us now!". In 2003 it was changed to [...] "That's what I like about Franklins!" [...] and again in 2004 to [...] "Cheap and Cheerful". That slogan is now rarely used, being largely replaced with and branded as [...] "Australia's <b>Original</b> <b>Discount</b> Grocer".The No Frills generic product range was relaunched in 2003 and promoted by its mascot [...] "Red Sock" [...] on TV advertisements and on its website. [...] "Red Sock" [...] now appears once every so often in the regular advertising on TV, radio, newspapers and catalogues for Franklins.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of a contract's length, callability, {{amortization}} and <b>original</b> <b>discount</b> by arbitrage methods. Among instruments that are callable without penalty, longer instruments command a higher interest rate because the borrower possesses the option of repaying relatively more slowly. However, the rate on longer self-amortizing loans cannot be substantially larger than for shorter ones because the payments decrease with contract length. Bounds on the tradeoff between points and rate for callable debt are characterized using the tradeoff for noncallable debt and the property that the value of the prepayment option increases in the loan's interest rate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{mechanisms}} of collective control, such as in Japanese keiretsu, that is characterized by firms’ groupings, decentralized decision-makings and cross-shareholdings. We develop a model about these mechanisms based on initial incentive contracts offered by shareholders to the manager, with an asymmetric information and with a possibility of compensation payments. These mechanisms of control are compared to reputation control, the latter working on <b>original</b> <b>discount</b> process. The results are obtained with simulations. The efficiency of the collective control depends on the levels of discount coefficient and on the differences in effort costs and expected profits. The collective control tends to dominate for {{a larger number of}} environment states for which reputation is inefficient to maintain discipline over the manager only. On the other hand, the reputation appears to be especially for high discounting coefficients, low learning costs or periods, and for high values of accumulated reputation.

50|$|The {{portion of}} the loan that is repaid {{consists}} of a repayment of capital and a payment of interest. <b>Original</b> issue <b>discount</b> rules separate the {{portion of the}} repayment that is attributable to interest and then taxes that amount at ordinary income rates. These rules prevent the avoidance of tax that might otherwise be available by characterizing the repayment as a capital gain, which is taxed at a lower rate, or by deferring the recognition of income until the bond is repaid at maturity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Original</b> Issue <b>Discount</b> (OID) {{is a type}} of {{interest}} that is not payable as it accrues. OID is normally created when a debt, usually a bond, is issued at a discount. In effect, selling a bond at a discount converts stated principal into a return on investment, or interest. The accurate determination of principal and interest is necessary in United States tax law to determine the basis of property and to determine whether an amount paid is deductible and includible as interest, or simply a nontaxable debt repayment.|$|R

The main tax rules of current importance in portfolio management in the United States are sorted out and expressed in formulas as an aid to financial modeling and computerization. As a foundation, the theory of constant yield to maturity is developed with generality ample enough to cover situations where the dates on which interest is compounded may not be equally spaced. Various inconsistencies are identified in the approaches to tax computation embodied in current regulations, such as the method of fractional exponents and the way of characterizing <b>original</b> issue <b>discount</b> or premium. Consistent alternatives to these approaches are proposed...|$|R

50|$|The {{methods and}} {{procedures}} by which municipal debt is issued are governed by an extensive system of laws and regulations, which vary by state. Most bonds bear interest at either a fixed or variable rate of interest, which can {{be subject to a}} cap known as the maximum legal limit; some bonds may be issued solely at an <b>original</b> issue <b>discount,</b> or 0% coupon. If a bond measure is proposed in a local election, a Tax Rate Statement may be provided to voters, detailing best estimates of the tax rate required to levy and fund the bond. In cases where no election is held, depending on applicable local law, voters may be entitled to petition the approval to referendum (i.e., a public vote) within a specified period of time; bonds are typically not issued prior to the expiration of any such referendum period.|$|R

5000|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. of 1895 initiated a wave or series of innovations {{for the financial}} services community in both tax-treatment and regulation from government. This specific case, according to a leading investment bank's research, resulted in the [...] "intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine," [...] ultimately leading to [...] "tax-free status." [...] The interest on municipal bonds is generally excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes (however, capital gains or accruing market discount are not tax exempt); for these purposes, accruing <b>original</b> issue <b>discount</b> is also treated as [...] "interest" [...] which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some municipal bonds, are called [...] "specified private activity bonds" [...] and are preference items under {{the alternative minimum tax}}. Additionally, corporate taxpayers may need to include interest on otherwise tax exempt municipal bonds in a calculation base for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and other special taxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} is to elect out of the installment method. In that case, the seller reports the fixed amounts (taking <b>original</b> issue <b>discount</b> into account for future fixed payments) plus the fair {{market value of the}} right to contingent payments. The taxpayer pays tax up front in the year of the sale on this total amount realized. The taxpayer then has a basis in the right to contingent payments equal to the amount reported as fair market value. The good news here is that the seller gets a little piece of the open transaction doctrine, and may fully recover basis in the contingent piece of the sale before reporting any additional contingent payments in future years. Where the profit ratio would have been high anyway and the fair market value of the contingent payments are low, the taxpayer may experience favorable consequences by effectively paying a little more tax up front and in return getting the first crop of contingent payments tax-free, while eliminating the risk of an unusable future capital loss.|$|R

50|$|Purchasers of {{municipal}} bonds {{should be aware}} that not all municipal bonds are tax-exempt, and not all tax-exempt bonds are exempt from all federal and state taxes. The laws governing the taxability {{of municipal}} bond income are complex. At the federal level they are contained in the IRS Code (Sections 103, 141-150), and rules promulgated thereunder. Additionally, special rules apply to certain types of investors (e.g., financial institution and property and casualty insurance companies) or in certain situations. For example, there is no IRS Code exemption for capital or other gains received from the sale of a municipal bonds and special rules apply for secondary market <b>discount</b> and <b>original</b> issue <b>discount</b> on municipal bonds. Each state will have its own laws governing what bonds, if any, are exempt from state taxes. For publicly offered bonds and most private placements, at the time of issuance a legal opinion will be provided indicating that the interest bonds are tax-exempt; these opinions do not customarily address collateral tax treatment. Offering documents, such as an official statement or placement memorandum, will contain further information regarding tax treatment of interest on the bonds. Investors {{should be aware that}} there are also post-issuance compliance requirements that must be met to ensure that the bonds remain tax-exempt. The IRS has a specific section of their website, www.irs.gov, devoted to tax exempt bonds and compliance with federal requirements.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in fiscal positions in advanced countries have sharply curtailed {{the issuance of}} government securities and created the possibility that government securities could disappear in some countries. The possibility that this might occur in the United States has attracted the most attention, {{in large part because}} of the international role of the U. S. dollar and the widespread perception that U. S. treasury securities have the lowest total financial risk (the combination of credit, market, and liquidity risks) among U. S. dollar assets. This paper analyzes the unique features of government securities and links them to the important roles that government securities, in particular U. S. treasury securities, have come to play in national and international financial markets.

40|$|The {{borrower}} and lender {{enter into}} an agreement whereby the borrower increases his mortgage payments for a specified period, {{at the conclusion}} of which the lender forgives a portion of the remaining principal on the loan. The borrower may terminate the arrangement at any time but receives no principal reduction if he makes less than 12 consecutive increased payments. The issue is how the lender should account for the portion of principal that may be forgiven. 1. Should the lender assume that the accelerated payments will be made to maturity and discount such accelerated payments using the current interest rate, thus recording a loss? 2. Should the lender assume that only 12 consecutive increased payments will be made and that other payments to maturity will be at the <b>original</b> rate and <b>discount</b> all payments using the current interest rate, thus recording a smaller loss? 3. Should the discount only be recorded as a loss when the borrower has made all the payments required or should the discount be accrued as a loss pro rata over the 12 -month period? EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that, assuming it is probable that the borrower will continue to make the increased payments for the specified period, the expense relating to the partial forgiveness should be accrued over the period of increased payments. Task Force members indicated that this approach to the accounting has already been consistently applied in practice...|$|R
40|$|Many {{observers}} {{claim that}} discounted cash-flow methods {{lead to a}} neglect of long-term and strategic decision-making. Using modern asset pricing methods, we examine one possible reason for this problem. If the cash-flows being discounted have an increasing dependence on an uncertain variable that tends to revert to a long-term equilibrium path {{in the face of}} short-term shocks, and if this reversion is ignored, then the uncertainty in the cash-flows will be overestimated. If this uncertainty causes risk discounting, then the amount of risk discounting that is appropriate will also be overestimated, which will tend to result in a relative undervaluation of long-term alternatives. We examine the implications of such an error for the comparative analysis of decision alternatives, including some involving an initial timing option. We use, as examples, decisions about production projects where the output price is the reverting variable. Where applicable, we look at two measures of what is meant by long-term: the operating duration of the project and the length of an initial timing option. For the projects without options, the analysis is based on the relatively straightforward "risk discounting effect" already mentioned. Reversion tends to decrease long-term uncertainty, and, with it, long-term risk discounting, which increases the relative value of long-term alternatives. Options complicate matters. The long-term decrease in uncertainty due to reversion tends directly to decrease long-term option values. Moreover, in addition to the <b>original</b> risk <b>discounting</b> effect and this "variance effect," there can be direct "future reversion effects" if the options involve a timing component or payoffs generated by cash-flows over a period of time. The overall influence can be a complicated mixture of the three different types of effects. We use this classification scheme to analyze two sets of examples: investment timing options on an instantaneous production project (equivalent to at-the-money American options on the project output price), and "now-or-never" options, as well as investment timing options, on projects that differ in their operating lives. We find that a neglect of reversion leads to an undervaluation of at- or in-the-money options on projects with longer operating lives. This is primarily due to the risk discounting effect. Longer timing options on the same project tend to be relatively overvalued by a neglect of reversion if the operating life of the project is moderately long, and undervalued if the project is instantaneous and currently at the money. The first is primarily due to variance and future-reversion effects. The second is primarily due to risk-discounting and future-reversion effects. Because parts of the economy may be influenced by short-term shocks in the presence of long-term equilibrium, these results suggest a reexamination of those aspects of analyses in the "real options" literature that depend on the use of non-reverting models.

40|$|At last, this {{dissertation}} considers another marketing {{implication of}} this number-location association, namely the compatibility effect. In experiment 7, we find that people perceive a discount as more attractive when the two prices are actually posited in compatible locations (<b>original</b> price-right side; <b>discounted</b> price-left side) than in incompatible locations. Similarly, experiment 8 demonstrates that {{people are more likely}} to patronage a supermarket when the supermarket's slogan about low price is shown on the left side of a display than on the right side, and this effect is mediated by the subjective fluency feeling people felt at the time they process the advertisement. Given a display, people usually think that large numbers should be located on the top or on the right hand side of the display, whereas small numbers should be posited at the bottom or on the left (Wood and Fischer 2008). Given this number-location association, this dissertation secondly intends to apply it to the field of marketing, and to use three experiments to explore how and why location of product image can influence people's price judgment. The results of experiment 4 show that consumers think that the market price of a product is higher if the product's image is shown on the right side of a display than on the left side; experiment 5 and experiment 6 further indicate that the location of product image can only influence consumers' price judgment, but cannot influence quality judgment. Key Words: Number-location association, Simulation, Perceptual Symbol Systems (PSS), Price perception. This dissertation firstly aims to provide new evidence for this number-location association. Experiment 1 demonstrates that people incorrectly remember that large numbers appear to the right of the locations they actually were shown while small numbers appear to the left ofthe locations than they actually were presented; experiment 2 and experiment 3 show that people estimate there are more pieces in a pile of object when the pile of object is presented on the right side of a display than on the left side.
