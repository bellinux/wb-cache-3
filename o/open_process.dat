In the first INA trials, Fay notes the three men were charged with Murder and abettment to murder of troops of the INA itself who had attempted to desert, and argues that this had been in an <b>open</b> <b>process</b> based on the INA's own laws, drawn from the Indian Army Act,1911, noting the court found the three men not guilty. However, Fay also describes the some of later ones of the ten or so trials, most prominently that of Burhan-ud-Din of Chitral and others, where the allegations of torture on Fay's opinion were justified. Nevertheless, Fay argues that these made up a few instances and by no means match up to the large scale torture alleged and concludes these to be war-time intelligence manoeuvres of the Jiffs campaign.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityOpen source product {{development}} {{refers to a}} paradigm where large numbers of participants collaborate {{in the form of}} communities to develop new products and services. The fundamental differences between traditional {{product development}} and <b>open</b> source <b>processes</b> are that the former is based on top-down decomposition while the latter is based on evolution and self-organization. The paradigm of <b>open</b> source <b>processes</b> has resulted in highly successful products such as Linux and Apache. Despite the success of various projects using <b>open</b> source <b>processes,</b> it is not well understood how the product structures and community structures evolve over time. In response, the main objective in this thesis is to analyze and model product structures and community structures of <b>open</b> source <b>processes</b> over time. The research objective consists of three parts: 1) the characterization of product structures in the <b>open</b> source <b>processes,</b> 2) the evolutionary characteristics of product structures in the <b>open</b> source <b>processes</b> over time, 3) the co-evolution of product structure and community structures over time. To achieve the first research objective, an agent-based model is proposed to simulate the <b>open</b> source <b>processes.</b> The effect of product structures on the <b>open</b> source <b>process</b> is analyzed based on a mobile phone example. To achieve the second research objective, an open source software project - Drupal is employed as the case studies. The evolution of product structure is determined by node-level mechanisms. To achieve the third research objective, the co-evolution of product structures and community structures is studied at different levels. The results from this research include new knowledge about the evolution of the product structures and co-evolution of product and community structures over time in <b>open</b> source <b>processes.</b> Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

Furthermore, our study suggests that context matters to both dialogic and <b>open</b> strategy <b>processes</b> and challenges universalist features of dialogue. Specifically, dialogic organization development and large group interventions perspectives can offer useful lenses to incorporate contextual features. Finally, our implications for practice suggest that particular organizing principles of <b>open</b> strategy <b>processes</b> can foster a healthy dialogic process in terms of enabling ongoing, diverse, and substantive interactions and inputs by stakeholders...|$|R

Before beginning the intervention of María Corina, the Member States’ representatives discuss if the meeting will be public of private after Nicaragua’s delegate to the OAS, Ricardo Seintenfus, asked the meeting to be closed, followed by Venezuela’s ambassador, Roy Chaderton, who asked voting for this initiative. With 22 votes in favor, 11 against and an abstention from Barbados, the Member States decided the meeting to be closed. The countries that voted for an <b>open</b> <b>process</b> to the press were Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and United States. María Corina qualified the decision as “censorship”. A group of Venezuelans protested {{in front of the}} seat of the OAS in Washington demanding transparency after the decision was taken. Henrique Capriles rejected the negative of the OAS to allow María Corina to discuss about the problems in Venezuela. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a statement qualifying the decision as an “international victory against the coup”. Adán Chávez, older brother of Hugo Chávez, has joined the government's effort of criticizing opposition mayors who have supported the protest actions, stating that they [...] "could end up like Scarano and Ceballos" [...] by being charged for various cases.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{observed}} {{that there is}} no reason whatever for the exemption of Literature, let us now turn to the case of Art. Every picture hung in a gallery, every statue placed on a pedestal, is exposed to the public stare of a mixed company. Why, then, have we no Censorship to protect us from the possibility of encountering works that bring blushes to the cheek of the young person? The reason cannot be that the proprietors of Galleries are more worthy of trust than the managers of Theatres; this would be to make an odious distinction which those very Managers who uphold the Censorship of Plays {{would be the first to}} resent. It is true that Societies of artists and the proprietors of Galleries are subject to the prosecution of the Law if they offend against the ordinary standards of public decency; but precisely the same liability attaches to theatrical managers and proprietors of Theatres, in whose case it has been found necessary and beneficial to add the Censorship. And in this connection let it once more be noted how much more easily the ordinary standards of public decency can be assessed by a single person responsible to no one, than by the clumsy (if more <b>open)</b> <b>process</b> of public protest. What, then, in the light of the proved justice and efficiency of the Censorship of Drama, is the reason for the absence of the Censorship of Art? The more closely the matter is regarded, the more plain it is, {{that there is no}}ne! At any moment we may have to look upon some painting, or contemplate some statue, as tragic, heart-rending, and dubiously delicate in theme as that censured play [...] "The Cenci," [...] by one Shelley; as dangerous to prejudice, and suggestive of new thought as the censured [...] "Ghosts," [...] by one Ibsen. Let us protest against this peril suspended over our heads, and demand the immediate appointment of a single person not selected for any pretentiously artistic feelings, but endowed with summary powers of prohibiting the exhibition, in public galleries or places, of such works as he shall deem, in his uncontrolled discretion, unsuited to average intelligence or sensibility. Let us demand it in the interest, not only of the young person, but of those whole sections of the community which cannot be expected to take an interest in Art, and to whom the purpose, speculations, and achievements of great artists, working not only for to-day but for to-morrow, must naturally be dark riddles. Let us even require that this official should be empowered to order the destruction of the works which he has deemed unsuited to average intelligence and sensibility, lest their creators should, by private sale, make a profit out of them, such as, in the nature of the case, Dramatic Authors are debarred from making out of plays which, having been censured, cannot be played for money. Let us ask this with confidence; for it is not compatible with common justice that there should be any favouring of Painter over Playwright. They are both artists--let them both be measured by the same last! ...|$|E

40|$|Coarse-graining is a {{standard}} method of extracting a simple Markov process from a more complicated one by identifying states. Here we extend coarse-graining to <b>open</b> Markov <b>processes.</b> An "open" Markov process is one where probability can flow {{in or out of}} certain states called "inputs" and "outputs". One can build up an ordinary Markov <b>process</b> from smaller <b>open</b> pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one <b>open</b> Markov <b>process</b> with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two <b>open</b> Markov <b>processes</b> side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author showed that these constructions make <b>open</b> Markov <b>processes</b> into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2 -morphisms are ways of coarse-graining <b>open</b> Markov <b>processes.</b> We also extend the already known "black-boxing" functor from the category of <b>open</b> Markov <b>processes</b> to our double category. Black-boxing sends any <b>open</b> Markov <b>process</b> to the linear relation between input and output data that holds in steady states, including nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability through the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with coarse-graining. Comment: Preliminary version, 43 page...|$|R

Design/Methodology/Approach – Starting from the assumption that culture matters in the knowledge transfer processes, we relied on extant literature on <b>open</b> innovation <b>processes,</b> <b>open</b> innovation intermediaries, and types of knowledge {{to build a new}} framework to understand which open innovation intermediary types are more suited to support the different <b>open</b> innovation <b>processes</b> supported by intermediaries and how they can help firms in overcoming cultural barriers. Originality/Value – The role of culture in open innovation has already been studied, though not in relation with its processes. Moreover, culture has not been analysed when open innovation intermediaries support <b>open</b> innovation <b>processes.</b> In order to fill this gap in literature, our paper focuses on the support that different types of open innovation intermediaries could give in overcoming the cultural barriers more likely to occur when implementing different open innovation knowledge transfer processes.
