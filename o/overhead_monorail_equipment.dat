40|$|Abstract—Semiconductor {{manufacturing}} is {{an important}} com-ponent of the U. S. manufacturing industry. Most of today’s fabrication facilities and those being designed for the near future use a bay layout configuration and an <b>overhead</b> <b>monorail</b> system for moving material between bays. These material handling systems are usually designed with a spine or perimeter type of configuration. This paper investigates the layout and material handling system design integration problem in semiconductor fabrication facilities and proposes a methodology for solving this integrated design problem. A spacefilling curve approach is used to address the facility layout, while {{the structure of the}} spine and perimeter configurations are exploited to create a network flow problem to determine the material handling system design. Computational results are presented and show exceptional promise for this procedure in solving the integrated design problem in a semiconductor manufacturing environment.

5000|$|The Bennie Railplane {{was a form}} of rail {{transport}} invented by George Bennie (1891 - 1957), which moved along an overhead rail by way of propellers. Bennie, born at Auldhouse, near Glasgow, Scotland began work on the development of his railplane in 1921. In 1929-1930 he built a prototype on a trial stretch of track over a 130 yd line at Milngavie, off the Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway, with one railplane car to demonstrate the system to potential clients. The car ran along an <b>overhead</b> <b>monorail,</b> stabilised by guide rails below. It moved by propellers powered by on-board motors. It was intended to run above conventional railways, separating faster passenger traffic from slower freight traffic. Bennie believed his railplane cars had the capability of travelling up to 120 mph and would offer a [...] "fast passenger and mails and perishable goods service". Slow and heavy goods freight and local passenger services would continue on the traditional rail service below. Each car could carry a maximum of 48 people, although the prototype had seating for fewer.|$|R
50|$|The trapeze {{was lowered}} through the T-shaped {{door in the}} bottom of the ship and into the slipstream, with an {{airplane}} attached to the crossbar by the skyhook above its top wing, its pilot on board and its engine running. The pilot tripped the hook and the airplane fell away from the ship. On his return, he positioned himself beneath the trapeze and climbed up until he could fly his skyhook onto the crossbar, at which point it automatically latched shut. Now, with the engine idling, the trapeze and airplane were raised into the hangar, the pilot cutting his engine as he passed through the door. Once inside, the airplane was transferred from the trapeze to a trolley, running on an <b>overhead</b> <b>monorail</b> system by which it could be shunted into one of the four corners of the hangar to be refueled and re-armed. Having a single trapeze raised two problems: it limited the rate at which airplanes could be launched and recovered and any fault in the trapeze would leave any airborne scouts with nowhere to land. The solution was a second, fixed trapeze permanently rigged further aft along the bottom of the ship at station 102.5 and known as the perch. By 1933 a perch was fitted and in use. Three more perches were planned (at stations 57.5, 80 and 147.5) but these were never fitted.|$|R

40|$|Wastewater lift {{stations}} are facilities designed to move wastewater from lower to higher elevation through pipes. Key elements of lift stations include a wastewater receiving well (wet-well), often {{equipped with a}} screen or grinding to remove coarse materials; pumps and piping with associated valves; motors; a power supply system; an equipment control and alarm system; and an odor control system and ventilation system. Lift station equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. They can be constructed on-site (custom-designed) or prefabricated. Lift station capacities range from 76 liters per minute (20 gallons per minute) to more than 378, 500 liters per minute (100, 000 gallons per minute). Pre-fabricated lift stations generally have capacities of up to 38, 000 liters per minute (10, 000 gallons per minute). Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in lift stations. A trapped air column, or bubbler system, that senses pressure and level is commonly used for pump station control. Other control alternatives include electrodes placed at cut-off levels, floats, mechanical clutches, and floating mercury switches. A more sophisticated control operation {{involves the use of}} variable speed drives. Lift {{stations are}} typically provided with equipment for easy pump removal. Floor access hatches or openings above the pump room and an <b>overhead</b> <b>monorail</b> beam, bridge crane, or portable hoist are commonly used. The two most common types of lift stations are the dry-pit or dry-well and submersible lift stations. In dry-well lift stations, pumps and valves are housed in a pump room (dry pit or dry-well), that is easily accessible. The wet-well is a separate chamber attached or located adjacent to the dry-well (pump room) structure. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the two types of pumps...|$|R
