50|$|A planet could {{possibly}} {{get into this}} situation by evaporating while orbiting inside the gaseous shell of the red giant {{and at the same}} time having its <b>orbit</b> <b>decay</b> due to bow-shock friction with the gas. Tides induce on the expanded star by the planet would also cause the orbit to decay, rather than expand as might have been expected to loss of gas from the star. These possibilities have been studied because that is the expected future of the Earth. Another hypothesis is that close-in planets could have formed during the merger of two white dwarfs.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to differentiate the cannibalism model from the merging model by considering the formation period of the BCGs. In the cannibalism model, there are numerous small galaxies present in the evolved cluster, whereas in the merging model, a hierarchical cosmological model is expected due {{to the collapse of}} clusters. It has been shown that the <b>orbit</b> <b>decay</b> of cluster galaxies is not effective enough to account for the growth of BCGs.The merging model is now generally accepted as the most likely one, but recent observations are at odds with some of its predictions. For example, it has been found that the stellar mass of BCG's was assembled much earlier than the merging model predicts.|$|E

50|$|Orbits with an {{altitude}} below 120 km generally have such high drag that the <b>orbits</b> <b>decay</b> too rapidly {{to give a}} satellite a sufficient lifetime to accomplish any practical mission. On the other hand, orbits with {{an altitude}} above 600 km have relatively small drag so that the <b>orbit</b> <b>decays</b> slow enough {{that it has no}} real impact on the satellite over its useful life. Density of air can vary significantly in the thermosphere where most low Earth orbiting satellites reside. The variation is primarily due to solar activity, and thus solar activity can greatly influence the force of drag on a spacecraft and complicate long-term orbit simulation.|$|R

40|$|Two deep-layer tropospheric {{temperature}} products, one for {{the lower}} troposphere (T 2 LT) and {{one for the}} midtroposphere (T 2, which includes some stratospheric emissions), are based on the observations of channel 2 of the microwave sounding unit on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. Revisions to version C of these datasets have been explicitly applied to account for the effects of <b>orbit</b> <b>decay</b> (loss of satellite altitude) and orbit drift (east–west movement). <b>Orbit</b> <b>decay</b> introduces an artificial cooling in T 2 LT, while the effects of orbit drift introduce artificial warming in both T 2 LT and T 2. The key issues for orbit drift are 1) accounting for the diurnal cycle and 2) the adjustment needed to correct for spurious effects related to the temperature of the instrument. In addition, new calibration coefficients for NOAA- 12 have been applied. The net global effect of these revisions (version D) is small, having little impact on the year-to-year anomalies. The change in global trends from C to D for 1979 – 98 for T 2 LT is an increase from � 0. 03 to � 0. 06 K decade� 1, and a decrease for T 2 from � 0. 08 to � 0. 04 K decade� 1. 1...|$|E

The problem is addressed in terms of meteoroids on earth collision courses, slowed by atmosphere entry/exit, entering elliptical orbits with apogees above the atmosphere. The overall capture probability is derived by integrating the capture fraction dependence on velocity and size over the probability frequency distribution of the collision courses. Account is taken of eventual <b>orbit</b> <b>decay,</b> lunar infall and ejection after encounters with the moon.

Rigorous mathematical techniques such as averaging, Poincare's method of small parameters, and Lagrange's expansion, applied to obtain a highly accurate, purely analytic theory for orbit contraction and ballistic entry into planetary atmospheres.
