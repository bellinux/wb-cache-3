They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play {{on the subject of}} Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{features}} of Play the World was a turnless game mode, a new concept never used in the previous versions of the Civilization series. The game mode allowed a sort of mixture between turn based and real time gameplay. Although the concept was good on paper, it never actually worked very well and many online players experienced <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> issues along <b>with</b> others.

25|$|In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah {{for only}} the third time since Thanksgiving was {{declared}} a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.

25|$|Historically the paschal {{full moon}} date {{for a year}} was found from its {{sequence}} number in the Metonic cycle, called the golden number, which cycle repeats the lunar phase on a certain date every 19 years.

On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of Unleavened Bread – for a total of seven days.|$|E

25|$|The Church's {{interest}} in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, {{when in the}} 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct {{for the fact that}} the Julian calendar had fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> the sky. Since the Spring equinox was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582. In 1789, the Vatican Observatory opened. It was moved to Castel Gandolfo in the 1930s and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope began making observation in Arizona, USA, in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E

500|$|An {{executive}} for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, {{due to the}} perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers. In his blog, 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007. Commenting {{on the lack of}} quality third-party support, he stated that [...] "the Wii landscape is bleak. Worse than it was on N64. Worse than on GameCube...the resulting third-party content is overwhelmingly bargain-bin trash." [...] The Globe and Mail and Forbes noted that the Wii had few successful third-party titles compared to its rivals (due, in part, to its weaker hardware). Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously ("blockbusters like the Call of Duty franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form"). Forbes observed that of the most successful games of 2011 ( [...] , Mass Effect 3, Portal 2, L.A. Noire, Battlefield 3, [...] ), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only Modern Warfare 3 received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the [...] "dilemma of having fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> its rivals in the console cycle"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the Wii U.
