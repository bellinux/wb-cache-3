5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in <b>or</b> <b>desire</b> for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal <b>or</b> <b>desire.</b> Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

She is included {{in a group of}} malevolent Hindu mother goddesses called the Matrikas and also in the group of Yoginis and Grahinis (Seizers). Ancient Indian medical texts prescribe her worship to protect children from diseases. A group of multiple Putanas is mentioned in ancient Indian texts.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 117 - 120. The {{question}} of which {{of our actions}} <b>or</b> <b>desires</b> are genuinely attributable to us is the question I examine in this thesis. I use the term "autonomous" to describe those agents whose <b>desires</b> <b>or</b> actions are genuinely their own, and I refer to actions <b>or</b> <b>desires</b> which cannot genuinely be attributed to agents as heteronomous actions <b>or</b> <b>desires.</b> I have chosen to discuss this question {{under the rubric of}} the concept of autonomy, although the number of near-synonyms in the philosophical literature means that I could, perhaps, have referred instead in my title to concepts such as freedom, responsibility, independence, authenticity, self-determination, self-identity, freedom of the will and similar concepts. But whatever terminological choice is made, the issue that interests me concerns the nature of those actions <b>or</b> <b>desires</b> which are genuinely the agent's - those desires and actions which, as some have put it, are the agent's rear desires and actions...|$|R

5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} <b>or</b> <b>desire</b> {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti there still is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E

The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E

25|$|A drive <b>or</b> <b>desire</b> can be {{described}} as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive. These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.|$|E
25|$|The Kama Sutra is {{an ancient}} text dealing with kama <b>or</b> <b>desire</b> (of all kinds), which in Hindu thought {{is one of the}} four {{normative}} and spiritual goals of life. The Kama Sutra is the earliest extant and most important work in the Kama Shastra tradition of Sanskrit literature. It was compiled by the philosopher Vatsyayana around the 4th century, from earlier texts, and describes homosexual practices in several places, as well as a range of sex/gender 'types'. The author acknowledges that these relations also involve love and a bond of trust.|$|E
