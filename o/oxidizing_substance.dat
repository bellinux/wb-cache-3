40|$|In the Torpedo {{electric}} organ, {{a modified}} nerve-muscle system, type A botulinum toxin blocked {{the release of}} acetylcholine (ACh) quanta, both neurally evoked and spontaneous. At the same time, the toxin increased {{the release of a}} class of small miniature potentials (the subminiature potentials), reduced the ATP and more the creatine phosphate content of the tissue, and impaired the activity of creatine kinase (CK). Thus, we compared this pattern of changes with those provoked by 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (FDNB), an efficient inhibitor of CK. As expected, FDNB rapidly inactivated CK, which resulted in a profound depletion of ATP whereas the stores of creatine phosphate were preserved. In addition, FDNB caused conspicuous morphological alterations of nerve endings and ACh depletion. This agent also suppressed evoked and spontaneous quantal release whereas the occurrence of subminature potentials was markedly increased. Diamide, a penetrating thiol <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substance,</b> provoked first a transient rise in quantal ACh release and then blockade of transmission with, again, production {{of a large number of}} subminiature potentials. Creatine phosphate was depleted in the tissue by diamide, the ATP content reduced, and CK activity partly inhibited. The morphology of nerve terminals did not show obvious changes with either diamide or botulinum toxin at the stage of transmission failure. Although the three poisons acted by different mechanisms, this resulted in a rather similar pattern of physiological changes: failure of quantal release and enhancement of subquantal release. These results and experiments on synaptosomes indicated that CK inhibition was probably a crucial mechanism for FDNB but not for diamide or botulinum intoxication...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhalation}} of silica {{has been}} shown to produce a dramatic inflammatory and toxic response within the lungs of humans and laboratory animals. A variety of cellular and biochemical parameters are used to assess the silica-induced lung injury. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the use of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence as a new method to study inflammation in both phagocytic cells and lung tissue recovered from silica-exposed animals. Chemiluminescence, or the emission of light, accompanies the release of reactive forms of oxygen when phagocytic cells are challenged. In this study, male Fischer 344 rats were intratracheally instilled with either silica (10 mg/ 100 g bw) or saline vehicle. One day after the instillations, a marked increase in the chemiluminescence was observed in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage cells recovered from the silica-treated animals when compared with the saline controls. The light reaction was markedly decreased by either superoxide dismutase of N-nitro-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. Superoxide dismutase is involved in the enzymatic breakdown of superoxide anion, while N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrocholoride, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, prevents the formation of nitric oxide. When superoxide anion and nitric oxide react, they form the highly <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substance</b> peroxynitrite. This study then implicates peroxynitrite as an agent that may be responsible for some of the oxidant lung injury that is associated with silica exposure.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the usually observed down-conversion PL emission, CDs are also known to display up-conversion PL (UCPL). Cao et al. [85] first reported UCPL in as-synthesized CDs with a two-photon absorption cross section of 39, 000 [*]±[*] 5000 GM, which were able to emit green PL upon excitation by 800  nm laser pulses. The group further exploited the UCPL properties for two-photon imaging of human breast cancer cells. Since then, UCPL has gained much attention as a favorable quality for various applications, particularly for bioimaging and photo-mediated therapy for cancer treatment. UCPL employs near-infrared (NIR) light as the excitation source and has the virtues of having deeper tissue penetration depth, reduced tissue scattering, and minimal photo-damage to the surrounding tissues. In sensing applications, CDs with UCPL properties have the additional advantage of providing a dual readout channel, increasing their selectivity toward the target ions. For instance, Castillo et al. [86] found that their CDs were responsive toward copper and iron metal ions when evaluating their down-conversion PL signals. However, only copper ions had an influence on the UCPL signals, which indirectly assisted {{the determination of the}} type of metal ion present. The dual-mode readout channel is also capable of widening the response range. Yin et al.

40|$|As {{early as}} the 17 th century it was {{recognized}} that one component in air is essential for life. This extremely simple molecule later known as dioxygen or commonly oxygen was discovered by Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm in 1771 - 72 by thermal decomposition of mercury oxide and potassium nitrate respectively. During {{the next three years}} Lavoisier worked on the characterization of the new element composing dioxygen. In 1775 he named it oxygen due to its presence in numerous acids (oxy = acid, gen = generate). Lavoisier also established the role of dioxygen in the respiratory process. The fundamental equation dioxygen=life was formulated for aerobic systems. Nearly two centuries later, in 1929, the electronic structure of dioxygen was solved by Linus Pauling using the theory of molecular orbitals. Pauling could explain the paramagnetism of dioxygen (cM= 0. 994 T- 1) as well as the interatomic distance (d= 1. 207 �) and the dissociation energy (Ediss= 117. 36 kcal mol- 1) which were until then poorly understood by chemists. This state is defined as the triplet state and depicted in term of molecular orbital in figure 1. The pioneering theory of Pauling could also predict the two metastable states of dioxygen where the molecule becomes diamagnetic. Both states are known as D and S singlet states (figure 2) and differ from the orbitals filling: the 1 Sy + state has the two electrons paired in the p* 2 py orbital whereas the 1 Dy has still on electron in each p* orbital but with reversed spin. The latter state has a life time of 45 Min. and an O-O bond distance of 1. 223 �. These singlet states are important for the reactivity of dioxygen in particular in the generation of ozone and radical species. These radicals are responsible for the formation of hydrogen peroxide, a highly <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substance</b> discovered by Thenard in 1818. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the cell is extremely dangerous as it destroys the protein structure. The relationship between oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the respiratory processes has been more deeply understood during the 20 th century. For example, myoglobin which binds oxygen was the first protein of which the structure was solved by X-Ray diffraction in 1960 [1]. This is showing the interests and efforts developed to establish how dioxygen is used by aerobic organisms. In {{the second part of the}} 20 th century the progress of medicine and biology has provided a better understanding of the importance of dioxygen and led to the discovery of numerous enzymes which are related to dioxygen. Although dioxygen is the basic source of energy for aerobic systems, its consumption produces radicals such as superoxide ion (O 2 -) in cells. This highly reactive radical is very toxic and implied in numerous pathologies. Fortunately a “dioxygen cycle” (figure 3) exists by which oxygen [3 O 2] can be activated or recycled such that toxicity problems are prevented. The close dependency of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and dioxygen reflects the complexity of the nature despite the use of very simple molecule for ensuring life. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide which is known as a cell killer due to its high oxidizing power is required as a substrate for many enzymes. A real paradox exists: hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide ion have to be present in living organisms but their concentration has to be controlled accurately so that they are only short living in cells. It was recognized early that metal containing species, in particular iron complexes, were involved in these processes. Rapidly the idea was accepted that a relatively simple unit is responsible for the transport and activation of dioxygen. Küster postulated a tetrapyrrolic structure [2] termed porphyrin. Its synthesis by Hans Fischer [3] established that its iron complex known as heme was able to bind dioxygen. Such heme units were shown to be essential for activating oxygen for oxidation reactions. There are now seven hemes known which differ from each other by the nature of the substituents on the b-pyrrole positions. The most common heme is heme b or hematin (figure 4). Several hundreds of heme b proteins are nowadays known which have different functions such as electron transfer, oxygen or nitric oxide transport or oxidation as shown in table 1. As all these proteins share exactly the same metal complex, it has been pointed out that the protein environment around heme b plays a decisive role in determining the function of the protein: 1) The amino acid residues maintain the heme unit bound to the protein 2) One amino acid residue coordinates axially to the iron in all heme proteins. The nature of this axial coordination is thought to be the most important factor which determines the enzyme’s activity. Therefore heme proteins are often classified according to the nature of the axial ligand (table 1). Finally the hydrophobic or polar character of the amino acid residues on the side opposite to the axial ligand (= distal side) tunes the specificity for a particular substrates and aids the formation of catalytic intermediates. The best known heme proteins are the globins, hemoglobin and myoglobin which are essential blood constituents. Peroxidases have also been the centre of intense studies as they were using hydrogen peroxide for oxidation in living organisms and have the same axial ligand, the nitrogen from histidine, as the globins. Less attention has been paid to Catalases which have a tyrosinate axial, similar to peroxidases. Finally heme-thiolate proteins are subject of special attention due to the unusual presence of a thiolate coordinating to the iron. Several heme models of the active site of the enzymes Chloroperoxidase and Catalase have been synthesized in order to study the influence of the axial ligand and peripherical meso heme substituents on the formation and characterization of catalytic intermediates. Each metal-free porphyrin was thoroughly characterized by NMR spectroscopy prior to the introduction of the iron atom to form the desired active site model. Each heme model was then characterized by UV-Vis, NMR, an EPR spectroscopy. Following results were observed: The attempts to obtain better models finally support the approach of bridged structures over tailed models. Contrary to the conclusion of Nakamura et al. with hydrogen bonded stabilized heme thiolate complex [122] we could not notice such an effect with the precursors 49 and 55. Nevertheless the results obtained for metal free tailed porphyrin have permit to establish that upon bridging the UV-Vis spectra are red shifted and that the conformation of the ortho amide substituents on the meso aryl groups is changed. For these reasons the future direction for having better binding constant is probably still to use an ortho amide function on the aryl moiety. But instead of having a bulky substituent directly linked to the carbonyl group of the amide this one should be anchored at a greater distance. For example the replacement of the tert-butyl group by a furan already improved the binding abilities of 11 [118]...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent Legionella contamination, several methods have been {{developed}} with which the bacteria can be killed in (tap) water. The most common method is thermal disinfection, with which the bacteria are killed through heating. Other methods use different techniques to kill Legionella, {{such as the use}} of UV-light, copper-silver ionisation or <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances.</b> In this literature study, the specific biological mechanisms behind several methods of Legionella control were studied. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in effectiveness. Of course, all methods also have advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, utility, safety and so on, but these are only marginally referred to in this research. UV-light only has an effect on the DNA of the micro-organism: the DNA is damaged and becomes dysfunctional, due to which the Legionella bacteria die. When using UV-light, it is of importance that the dosage and duration of the radiation is sufficient. With a short exposure, a high intensity is needed to provide enough energy. The dosage emitted by the UV-lamp can moreover damage only a limited amount of DNA. If the Legionella are located in protozoa that have a large amount of DNA (in the nucleus as well as the mitochondria), possibly less damage is done to the DNA of the Legionella bacteria. Copper-silver ionisation is a cheap method and an effective way of killing Legionella. However, as with UV-light, the Legionella bacteria can be protected by the protozoa and/or a biofilm. Another disadvantage is that the use of heavy metals in waterworks brings with it risks for public health. Besides above mentioned methods, there are <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances</b> that can kill off Legionella. Of these, chlorine is especially suitable in preventing the spread of Legionella, as a supplement to other methods. Disinfection with ozone is more effective, but has the disadvantage that ozone is quickly deactivated in water. Peroxides are also used extensively in waterworks disinfection. Similar to UV-light and copper-silver ionisation, the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances</b> must penetrate the protozoa that harbour the Legionella for a proper disinfection. Whether these methods of disinfection have a sufficiently lethal effect on Legionella is not yet known. With thermal disinfection, Legionella bacteria that have infected the protozoa are also reached, as well as the Legionella bacteria located in a biofilm. The temperature increases without as well as within the protozoa, and leads to damage to the Legionella bacteria present. A second point that supports thermal disinfection methods is that, through heating, multiple parts of the cell are destroyed. The chance that Legionella survives this combination of factors is in this way reduced to a minimum...|$|R

Only 125 native urine is required to measure oxalate concentrations in the range of 80 / to 1. 6 mmol/ 1 (corresponding to 7 to 144 mg anhydrous oxalic acid per liter). The limit of detection is 10 nmol oxalate, and the accuracy is 101 % with a coefficient of variation of 6 %. The method described is insensitive to various interfering factors, such as reducing and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances,</b> cloudy or colored samples. It is therefore also suitable for oxalate determination in food technology and plant breeding. Bestimmung von Oxalat in Urin mit OxalafrOxidase: Vergleich mit Oxalat-Decarboxylas...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of ozonation process for 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (2 -MBT) removal follows from results of ozonation {{of the model}} wastewater. Total removal of 2 -MBT was observed after 20 minutes of ozonation. Very good reproducibility of repeated ozonation trials including sampling and analysis was observed. However, the majority of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) remained in the reaction mixture. Benzothiazole (BT) and 2 -hydroxybenzothiazole (OBT) intermediates were identified during degradation of 2 -MBT with ozone. In addition to the above benzothiazole derivatives, the creation of some other organic compounds follows from results of mass balance. The best fits of experimental data were obtained using the first kinetic model for 2 -MBT and zero-order kinetic model for COD and DOC. The reaction time of 60 minutes {{can be considered as}} effective with regard to controlled oxidation in order to increase a portion of partially <b>oxidized</b> <b>substances.</b> Higher biodegradability and lower toxicity of ozonation products on respiration activity of activated sludge microorganisms was observed at higher ozonation time...|$|R
25|$|Redox (reduction-oxidation) {{reactions}} {{include all}} chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances {{that have the}} ability to <b>oxidize</b> other <b>substances</b> are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that {{have the ability to}} reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous materials represents {{a significant percentage}} of the total transportation costs of goods. Hazardous materials (HazMats) comprise explosives, flammables, <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances,</b> poisonous gases, and radioactive materials. These materials can be extremely harmful to the environment and human health, since exposure to their toxic ingredients can injure or kill plants, animals, and humans. The hazards associated with HazMat transportation cannot be avoided because commodities will always need to be transported to areas of need. The risk associated with transporting a HazMat depends not only on the substance being transported, but also on the characteristics of the road network such as road type, weather conditions, drivers’ skills, and population concentration along the chosen routes. The risk associated with such an activity is essentially related to the possibility of an accident with negative environmental and public health consequences. Reducing the potential negative impacts of transporting HazMat is an important task for communities, governments, HazMat producers and shippers. Over the last few decades, systems have been developed to help decision-makers find the best solutions. Typically, the software used is a decision support system. This paper is a review on the experiences of using such systems over the last few years...|$|R
