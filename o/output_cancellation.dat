As opposed to classical adaptive filtering which focuses on the suppression of noise, our model employs an adaptive filter that performs target cancellation. T-F units dominated by target are largely suppressed at the <b>output</b> of the <b>cancellation</b> unit when compared to units dominated by noise.

INTRODUCTION The past research on {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) multiuser detection has mainly concentrated on the uncoded case, that is, the channel coding is assumed to be totally independent from the multiuser detection and is thus ignored in the analysis and algorithm design [1]. Recently, there has been a growing interest for an integrated approach, where the channel coding is taken into account in the design and analysis of the multiuser receivers. This approach may be combined with the iterative decoding techniques, which are a new popular research topic in the area of coding theory, mainly because of the Turbo codes [2].

40|$|For modern {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR), it has much more urgent demands on ground moving target indication (GMTI), which includes not only the point moving targets like cars, truck or tanks but also the distributed moving targets like river or ocean surfaces. Among the existing GMTI methods, displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) can effectively cancel the strong ground clutter and has been widely used. However, its detection performance {{is closely related to}} the target’s signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) as well as radial velocity, and it cannot effectively detect the weak large-sized river surfaces in strong ground clutter due to their low SCR caused by specular scattering. This paper proposes a novel method called relative residue of DPCA (RR-DPCA), which jointly utilizes the DPCA <b>cancellation</b> <b>outputs</b> and the multi-look images to improve the detection performance of weak river surfaces. Furthermore, based on the statistics analysis of the RR-DPCA outputs on the homogenous background, the cell average (CA) method can be well applied for subsequent constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. The proposed RR-DPCA method can well detect the point moving targets and distributed moving targets simultaneously. Finally, the results of both simulated and real data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAR/GMTI method...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} roles of interaural correlation (ρ) and of the monaural power spectrum in the detection and discrimination of narrow-band-noise signals (462 – 539  Hz) in broadband maskers (0 – 3  kHz). The power and ρ of the target band were independently controlled, while the flanking noise was fixed and diotic. Experiments 1 and 2 involved ρ and power values that would be produced by specific values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the NoSπ binaural configuration. Listeners were required to discriminate different SNRs via a 2 I-FC loudness-discrimination task. At low reference SNRs, changes in ρ fully accounted for listeners’ performance, but as reference SNR increased, additional energy in the target band played an increasing role. Experiment 2 showed that at these higher SNRs the combination of information from the power spectrum and ρ was superadditive {{and could not be}} explained by simple signal-detection models. The equalization-cancellation (EC) theory would explain these data using the <b>output</b> from interaural <b>cancellation,</b> Y, rather than ρ. Experiment 3 attempted to foil binaural processing, by fixing either ρ or Y across intervals.

40|$|Abstract: Factor {{screening}} {{searches for}} the really important inputs (factors) among the many inputs that are changed in a realistic simulation experiment. Sequential bifurcation (or SB) is a sequential method that changes groups of inputs simultaneously. SB is the most e¢ cient and effective method if the following assumptions are satis ed: (i) second-order polynomials are adequate approximations of the input/output (I/O) functions implied by the simulation model; (ii) the signs of all first-order (or main) effects are known; (iii) if two inputs have no important first-order effects, then they have no important second-order effects either (heredity property). This paper examines SB for random simulation with multiple responses (outputs), called multi-response SB (MSB). This MSB selects "batches" of inputs such that within a batch all inputs have the same sign for {{a specific type of}} <b>output,</b> so no <b>cancellation</b> of main effects occurs.

30|$|Antenna {{diversity}} {{is one of}} the most practical, effective, and widely employed technique in wireless communication receivers to reduce the effects of fading and to provide increased signal strength at the receiver. Different techniques are known to combine the signals received from multiple diversity branches. The most popular diversity techniques are equal-gain combining (EGC), maximal-ratio combining (MRC), selection combining (SC), and a combination of MRC and SC, called generalized-selection combining (GSC). The SC receiver chooses the branch with the strongest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while MRC provides optimal performance, at the expense of implementation complexity, since it requires knowledge of all channel parameters. In EGC receiver, the signals in all branches are weighted with the same factor, irrespective of the signal amplitude. Moreover, co-phasing of all input signals is needed to avoid <b>output</b> signal <b>cancellation.</b> The performance of EGC and MRC diversity receivers has been extensively conducted in many previous works for several well-known fading statistical models, such as Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami—assuming independent or correlative fading [1 – 6]. The Weibull distribution is a well-known model for describing multipath fading channels in both indoor and outdoor radio propagation environments. In [7], novel analytical expressions for the joint probability density function (PDF), moment generating function (MGF), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are derived for the multivariate Weibull distribution. The presented theoretical results are applied to analyze the performance of several diversity receivers such as SC, EGC, and MRC techniques operating under correlated Weibull fading channels (WFC). For these diversity receivers, several useful performance criteria such as moments of output SNR, including the amount of fading (AoF), and outage probability (OP) are analytically derived. Moreover, the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for several coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes is studied using moment generating function (MGF) approach. In [8], capitalizing on the general α- μ fading model simple and precise closed-form approximations to the PDF and CDF of the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Weibull variates are derived. These approximations find applicability in several wireless communications issues such as signal detection and combining, linear equalizers, intersymbol interference, and phase jitter [8]. Considering related works, C. Sagias et al. [9, 10], have presented a moments-based approach to analyzing the performance of dual-branch EGC and MRC receivers, operating under either independent or correlated, but not necessary identically distributed WFC. In this respect, significant performance criteria, such as average output SNR, AoF, and spectral efficiency at low power regime, are extracted in closed-forms, using the moments of the output SNR for both independent and correlative fading cases. Using the same approach of the moment, El Bouanani [11 – 14] has generalized this idea to L-branches over independent and not necessary identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Weibull fading channels for both MRC and EGC receivers. Consequently, he has derived some performance criteria such as AoF, MGF, average capacity (AC), and ASEP in closed forms. In [15], we have generalized the same idea to derive the approximate expressions of MRC performance criteria over correlated WFC.|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{division}} duplex (FDD) is {{the most}} widely used full duplex technique for modern wireless communication systems. A device called a duplexer is needed in order to separate the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) signals. To avoid RX being saturated and desensitized, the isolation between the TX and RX ports of the duplexer needs to be as large as possible. However, such a duplexer is less desirable for a base station due to its bulky size, high cost and design challenges. Relaxing the isolation performance requirement of the duplexer allows TX signal to appear in the RX path. Such a signal is known as TX leakage and consists of in-band and out-of-band portions. Due {{to the fact that the}} in-band leakage can’t be filtered out with conventional filtering techniques, an active cancellation system is required. This thesis will present a novel wide band TX leakage cancellation approach along with two new modelling techniques. The cancellation system is based on the analog finite impulse response (FIR) filter structure and consists of several cancellation paths (also known as taps). In each of the taps, there is an attenuator, phase shifter and delay line. These components are utilized to recondition the reference signal which is the replica of the output signal of the high power amplifier (PA) in the TX path. The <b>output</b> of the <b>cancellation</b> system (the cancellation signal) in theory should have the same amplitudes, but 180 � phase offsets from the leakage signal within the band of interest. By combining the cancellation signal and the leakage, the latter can thus be suppressed. The two novel modelling techniques, named as the modified adaptive delay filter using direct cross-correlation (MADF-DC) and the modified compressed sampling matching pursuit (MCoSaMP) are proposed in this thesis. The two algorithms are developed from the classic adaptive delay filter (C-ADF) and the classic compressed sampling matching pursuit (C-CoSaMP), respectively. These modelling techniques can provide the optimization of not only the amplitudes and phase, but the delays. They are designed for the cancellation system in order to achieve wide band cancellation with the minimum hardware resources. The evaluation of the cancellation system was carried out utilizing a test bench, which represented a typical base station. Experimental results show that greater than 15 dB of cancellation has been achieved for 35 MHz bandwidth at the carrier frequency of 897. 5 MHz using four taps. In contrast, such result is about 7 dB less than the simulated cancellation performance. The reasons of such performance degradation have been analysed and will be presented in this thesis. vi...|$|R
