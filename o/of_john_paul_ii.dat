5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier {{requested}} this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope's longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II.</b> It is currently displayed in the same chapel as the bishops' crypt.|$|E

25|$|A long {{procession}} {{was begun}} {{in order to}} transfer the body <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II</b> from the Clementine Hall, through the colonnades of the Apostolic Palace and into St. Peter's Square among the waiting people. Traditionally, the pope's body is then brought to either St. Peter's Basilica or the papal cathedral, St. John Lateran Basilica. A procession of monks, priests and bishops paced slowly along a route towards St. Peter's Basilica. The College of Cardinals trailed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and Cardinal Martínez Somalo followed them.|$|E
25|$|Both Pius XII and John Paul II felt a {{close bond}} to Fátima in that Pius XII {{was being made}} an {{archbishop}} in Rome on May 13, 1917, just as the first messages of Fatima were being reported and John Paul II was shot on May 13, 1981 in Saint Peter's Square and attributed his recovery to Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Pius XII's two consecrations were made in October 1942 and July 1952 and those <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II</b> in May 1982 and March 1984. This paralleled the consecration {{of the world to}} the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Pope Leo XIII in 1899.|$|E
25|$|The second miracle {{was deemed}} {{to have taken}} place shortly after the late pope's beatification on 1 May 2011; it was {{reported}} to be the healing of Costa Rican woman Floribeth Mora of an otherwise terminal brain aneurysm. A Vatican panel of expert theologians examined the evidence, determined that it was directly attributable to the intercession <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II,</b> and recognised it as miraculous. The next stage was for Cardinals who compose the membership of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to give their opinion to Pope Francis to decides whether to sign and promulgate the decree and set a date for canonisation.|$|E

25|$|On 4 April, {{the body}} <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II</b> was moved onto a red velvet catafalque, {{with his head}} propped on three red pillows. The Papal Gentlemen, clothed in black morning coats and white gloves, were chosen as pallbearers and stood {{along the sides of}} the pope's bier. Cardinal Martínez Somalo, dressed in red and gold vestments, officiated the {{asperges}} rite. He blessed the pope with the holy waters of baptism three times: {{to the right of the}} pope, at his head and then to his left. An acolyte then brought to the Camerlengo a thurible and boat. Cardinal Martínez Somalo incensed the pope three times.|$|E
25|$|The Papal {{conclave}} of October 1978 {{was triggered}} by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign {{for at least a}} decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
25|$|The event had an {{estimated}} viewership of over 2 billion people; the Catholic Church claims only 1.3 billion among its members. The funeral <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>II</b> {{was by far}} the largest funeral {{in the history of the}} world. In lieu of a public viewing at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, as was tradition, immense digital screens instead broadcast the Mass of Requiem and subsequent Rite of Interment to those in the pope's cathedral church outside the confines of Vatican City. The same digital screens were hoisted at several sites in Rome, including the Circus Maximus, and at specially designated campsites outside the city for the millions of pilgrims who descended on the city.|$|E

Writing in the Guardian, Stephen Bates said: [...] "John Cornwell {{has produced a}} devastating report. Catholics should read it, if not to change their views - though perhaps it should - then at least to inform them".|$|R
