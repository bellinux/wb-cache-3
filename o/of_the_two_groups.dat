5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E

5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the trip would take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, and ice on the Niagara River, inclement weather and ice on Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' slow progress. Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers, finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) and culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> colonial administrators believed {{the inhabitants of the}} Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had {{returned to}} the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.|$|E
5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains.

40|$|Abstract-A group {{detector}} jointly detects a {{group of}} users, and a parallel group detection scheme is a bank of J independently operating group detectors, one for each group of a J group partition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I< transmitting users of a Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) channel. In this paper, <b>two</b> <b>group</b> detectors are introduced for the Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading (FSRF) CDMA channel. While the optimum multiuser detector has a Time Complexity per Symbol (TCS) of O(MK/K) for M-ary signaling, each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> detectors has a TCS of O(&ZiGi/lGl) where IGI is the group size. Hence, there are parallel group detection schemes, based on each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> detectors, that satisfy {{a wide range of}} complexity constraints that result from <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> partition. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> detec-tors is minimax optima 1 in the corresponding conditional group near-far resistance measure. Furthermore, a succinct indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average BER over high SNR regions is defined via the asymptotic efficiency. A lower bound and an exact formula for the asymptotic efficiency are derived for the first and second group detectors, respectively. The group detection approach for the FSRF-CDMA channel generalizes previous approaches to the complexity-performance tradeoff problem. It yields the optimum detector when the group size is I<. When the group size is equal to one, the first group detector results in a new optimum linear detector and the second reduces to a recently proposed suboptimum linear detector. All other nontrivial partitions yield new multiuser detectors whose performances are commensurate with their complexities.

5|$|The November 1959 {{uprising}} and {{the subsequent}} fighting between Hutu and Tutsi began the revolution, but according to Carney it was the Belgian response which ensured that it {{would result in a}} permanent reversal in the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> with the Hutu emerging in power. The single biggest decision maker in this response was Colonel Guy Logiest, a Belgian army colonel working in the Congo with the Force Publique. Logiest was a personal friend of Ruanda-Urundi governor Jean-Paul Harroy, and had already been asked, {{before the start of the}} revolution, to come to Rwanda to evaluate Belgium's military options in the colony. Following the outbreak of violence, Logiest accelerated his departure from the Congo, arriving in Rwanda on 4 November. Logiest arrived with a number of soldiers and paratroopers and was tasked with re-establishing civil order.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell decided {{there would be more}} profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh slate {{industry}} {{was essentially a}} Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales. The industry had a considerable influence on {{the culture of the}} area and on that of Wales as a whole. The caban, the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of minutes from a caban at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on Church Disestablishment, tariff reform and other political topics. Eisteddfodau were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own band, with the Oakley band particularly famous. Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography who started their working lives as slate quarrymen, compared to only four owners, though obviously there was also a distinct disparity in the numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
