5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
25|$|There is much rabbinic {{material}} <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to {{the soul}} of the deceased after death, what it experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: Hibbut ha-kever, the pains of the grave; Dumah, the angel of silence; Satan as the angel of death; the Kaf ha-Kela, the catapult of the soul; Gehinom (purgatory); and Gan Eden (heaven or paradise). All classic rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding. Therefore, these ideas are expressed throughout rabbinic literature through many varied parables and analogies.|$|E

500|$|Australian naval historians David Stevens and Tom Frame {{disagree}} <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next. Stevens {{states that}} Cumberledge assembled the ship's {{company in the}} early afternoon, read the Articles of War, lectured them on the seriousness of refusing duty, then ordered the stokers {{to go to their}} stations, which they did meekly. Frame claims that the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge cleared lower deck and spoke to the sailors. After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship's senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a mutiny and arrested pending a court-martial, which was held aboard [...] on 20 June, after Australia arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had [...] "joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence", and they were sentenced to imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour. A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame disagree on details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty. Both authors agree that these men were tried by the captain while Australia was still at sea, and punished with 90 days each in cells.|$|E
500|$|Battle mode {{is similar}} to the [...] "all-range mode" [...] {{employed}} in Star Fox 64 for some bosses and levels. Like the cancelled Star Fox 2 the game is completely all-range, as opposed to the [...] "on-rails" [...] levels featured in most other Star Fox games (however, the game will sometimes force the player to engage in classic [...] "chase" [...] missions in order to complete an objective). The usual objectives are to destroy a base ship, destroy all enemies, or collect a number of cores to complete the battle mode. Once the battle mode is completed, the game returns to the map mode. As players progress through the game, {{they will be able to}} choose to go different routes upon completing certain levels. Each route has its own character dialogue to accompany it, and players will be able to visit differing planets depending on what routes they choose. The game features 9 different endings altogether, and gamers can access all of them by playing the game multiple times, selecting different routes each time. Instead of merely giving different perspectives <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the Star Fox team, each ending is unique [...] the characters go in various directions depending on what ending is watched. Star Fox Command does not feature traditional voice acting. Instead it outputs gibberish akin to the [...] "voices" [...] in Star Fox for the SNES, or the [...] "Lylat speech" [...] present in Lylat Wars (but not Star Fox 64). Players can also record their own voices into the game’s [...] "gibberish generator" [...] using the built-in DS microphone where it is converted into the garbled speech of the various characters.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

2500|$|On June 20, 1854, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 11,135 to O.H. Needham for {{a breast}} pump. Scientific American (1863) credits L.O. Colbin as the {{inventor}} and patent applicant of a breast pump. In 1921-23, engineer and chess master Edward Lasker produced a mechanical breast pump that imitated an infant's sucking action and was regarded by physicians as a marked improvement on existing hand-operated breast pumps, which failed {{to remove all}} the milk from the breast. The U.S. Patent Office issued [...] for Lasker's breast pump. In 1956 Einar Egnell published his groundbreaking work, [...] "Viewpoints <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> mechanically in the female breast during various methods of milk collection". This article provided insight to {{the technical aspects of}} milk extraction from the breast. The Egnell SMB breastpump designed through this research is quite robust and many pumps are still in operation today over 50 years after publication.|$|E

It is [...] "a spoof-cum-satirical take <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when an Indian politician gets to lead a Gubernatorial election in the U.

While it {{was held by}} the Taliban Musa Qala was described by the MOD as [...] "a key staging post for arms and drugs transported to and from Pakistan and Iran", who stated that the Taliban want to regain control of it because of its tactical importance.

2500|$|In 1989, C. Everett Koop (in {{his last}} year as Surgeon General) {{commissioned}} the [...] "National Museum of Health and Medicine Foundation", a private, nonprofit organization to explore avenues for its future development and revitalization, {{with the aim of}} ultimately returning its collection to a venue on the National Mall. Proposed was “a site on land that is located east of and adjacent to the Hubert H. Humphrey Building (100 Independence Avenue, Southwest, in the District of Columbia)”. In 1993, a draft bill authored by Sen. Edward Kennedy [...] proposed $21.8 million for moving the existing collection to a new facility to be constructed on that site. That bill, however, was never introduced owing to political difficulties including objections from Constance Breuer—widow of Marcel Breuer, architect of the Humphrey Building—who objected to the view obstruction that would be entailed by the proposed construction. A letter from the Department of Defense to Koop in the mid-1990s, expressed hope that the NMHM exhibits would [...] "one day be provided the appropriate and prominent home they deserve back at the National Mall in the new National Health Museum". But the DoD backed away from contributing to funding a new museum. The Foundation has since been superseded by a new organization, dedicated to creating a new National Health Museum, and which has more ambitious aims and is not dependent <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the existing NMHM.|$|E
