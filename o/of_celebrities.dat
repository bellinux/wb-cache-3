40|$|It is a truism {{to suggest}} that celebrity pervades all areas of life today. The growth and {{expansion}} <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> culture {{in recent years has}} been accompanied by an explosion of studies of the social function <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> and investigations into the fascination <b>of</b> specific <b>celebrities.</b> And yet fundamental questions about what the system <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> means for our society have yet to be resolved: Is <b>celebrity</b> a democratization <b>of</b> fame or a powerful hierarchy built on exclusion? Is celebrity created through public demand or is it manufactured? Is the growth <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> a harmful dumbing down of culture or an expansion of the public sphere? Why has celebrity come to have such prominence in today’s expanding media? Milly Williamson unpacks these questions for students and researchers alike, re-examining some of the accepted explanations for celebrity culture. The book questions assumptions about the inevitability of the growth <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> culture, instead explaining how environments were created in which celebrity output flourished. It provides a compelling new history of the development <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> (both long-term and recent) which highlights the relationship between the economic function <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> in various media and entertainment industries and its changing social meanings and patterns of consumption...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the criteria}} <b>of</b> effective <b>celebrity</b> endorsement and the typology <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement {{on social media}} and investigates the opportunities and risks <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media {{in the context of}} Taiwan. Secondary research was conducted to create an in-depth understanding regarding celebrity endorsement. Eight experts <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement in Taiwan from different industries were interviewed to share cases and experiences about celebrity endorsement on social media that they had participated in, in order to discuss the criteria <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> selection, the type of endorsement and strengths and weakness <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement, as well as, subsequently, to discover the opportunities and risks <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media. The findings show number of fans/followers, interaction with fans/followers and relevant, useful and interesting of the content are three evident criteria <b>of</b> effective <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media that differ from traditional media. Secondly, a celebrity is usually hired to be the brand ambassador, opinion leader and to practice celebrity product placement on social media. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the advantages <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media are that it is easier for companies to evaluate the results, it is cost effective, cuts through the noise and provides more information; while public controversy, less control over the endorser and making companies vulnerable to criticism are disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media. Based on the findings above, the researcher has discovered that the opportunities for celebrity endorsement on social media including building relationships with consumers, being affordable for small brands and making promotional messages more convincing; while the risks consist of the difficulty of handling a crisis, the over-commercialisation of social media and ethical issues. The study is intended to add insight to the existing knowledge regarding celebrity endorsement as well as to provide direction for marketers to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsement on social media...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes to}} redefine celebrity {{as a kind}} of capital, thereby {{extending}} Bourdieu’s field theory. This redefinition is necessary, it is argued, because one of the main limitations shared by current definitions <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> is their lack of explanatory power of the convertibility <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> into other resources, such as economic or political capital. Celebrity capital, or broadly recognizability, is conceptualized as accumulated media visibility that results from recurrent media representations. In that sense, it is a substantial kind of capital and not a subset or special category of social or symbolic capital, the latter being defined as legitimate recognition by other agents in a social field. Rather than adding another definition <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> next to many others, the notion <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> capital proposed here should be seen as an attempt to integrate the existing approaches <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> into a single comprehensive conceptualization that can enable us to grasp this societal and cultural phenomenon better...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{takes as}} its subject celebrity and {{consumption}} {{and the cultural}} logic <b>of</b> the <b>celebrity</b> brand. It introduces the concept of celebritisation as the engine <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> culture, discussing ways in which celebrity brands operate as ‘map-making’ devices which situate consumers within networks of symbolic resources. We construct particulars via an investigative narrative that draws critically upon published accounts of the life and work of Andy Warhol, generating observations of signature practices and technologies <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>Celebrity</b> Brandhood. Within an inductive architecture we modulate to celebrity brands as transmediated marketing accomplishments which trade upon allure, glamour and charisma, constructed around rituals of transition, belonging, intimacy, and affect. We suggest that {{at the heart of}} the machinery of the cultural logic <b>of</b> the <b>Celebrity</b> Brand is the mediated spectacle as a field of social invention and transformation. In this way, the paper opens up pathways toward further interpretive analyses <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> brands, articulating the basis <b>of</b> accounts <b>of</b> <b>Celebrity</b> Brand Theoretics...|$|R

Later that year, Bryce introduced Fleming to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three of them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, formed the partnership Xanadu Productions, named after Bryce's Bahamian home, but which was never actually formed into a company. In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full <b>of</b> <b>celebrities</b> and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West.|$|E

The analysis leads to estimation results showing that gender of the consumer matters critically in determining the level of effectiveness that persuasion <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsed advertising could possibly reach. Through our regression exercise, we also find that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsed advertising crucially depends on the level of consumer income. In addition, our regression results also suggest that the socio-cultural background of the consumer plays a critical role in affecting the persuasiveness level <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorsed advertising...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} a wide {{spectrum}} of contemporary works of literature currently available that implicitly engage issues <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> culture, this thesis focuses specifically on three representations <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> that have contemporary cultural resonance: 1. celebrity as image in Martin Amis's Money (1984), where I examine how the trappings <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> culture can detrimentally shape self-image and dictate behavioral conformity; 2. celebrity as identity in Bret Easton Ellis's Glamorama (1998), where I examine how celebrity defines cultural conceptions of success, desire, image, and fashion, and encourages a superficial, surface-level engagement with the world; and, 3. celebrity as secular religion in Chuck Palahniuk's Survivor (1999), where I explore how the same reverential mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> operate in religious fanaticism. I have selected these novels in order to provide a representative sampling of contemporary fiction dealing with celebrity from the 1980 s to present, a period which coincides with the explosion of popular culture in the academy, and the emergence <b>of</b> <b>celebrity</b> as a topic of theoretical attention, if not critical literary attention...|$|R
