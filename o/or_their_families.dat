5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on the Internet {{and the opportunity to}} collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{four are}} being aided by local Ibizan Carmen (Leticia Dolera), who begins a {{relationship}} with Baxter. They soon realise they are still being hunted when their rental car explodes. Quinn is kidnapped by Mackenzie (David Warner), an elderly British expatriate who is revealed {{to be the leader}} of the drug operation. The four are forced to return the money in exchange for their lives. When they are €100 short from a speeding fine, Mackenzie makes the four produce fake ecstasy for a nightclub, at which point he allows them to return home with five million euros that were paid to them by the nightclub, though Carmen is left behind. Mackenzie tricks them into boarding a ferry for Morocco, where they are arrested and sent to a black site prison in the desert. After another attempt on their lives, they are informed that the drug operation was organised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who are using the operation to fund black operations, {{and as a result of}} the four's interference a kill contract is out against them. With assistance by the British government, they move to Cape Town, South Africa, to live new lives and identities to avoid CIA detection, though they are no longer allowed to contact each other <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E

KLM paid the victims <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> compensation ranging between $58,000 and $600,000. The sum of settlements for property and damages was $110 million (an average of $189,000 per victim due to limitations imposed by European Compensation Conventions in effect at the time).|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the Indian {{government}} {{passed a}} law forbidding women <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> from asking about {{the sex of the}} baby after an ultrasound scan (or any other test which would yield that information) and also expressly forbade doctors or any other persons from providing that information. In practice this law (like the law forbidding dowries) is widely ignored, and levels of abortion on female foetuses remain high and the sex ratio at birth keeps getting more skewed.|$|E
25|$|Many street {{children}} spend 300 rupees {{a month on}} movies, though older children also use their money to buy cigarettes, chewing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Street children often spend very little on clothing because their employers often provide clothes for work <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> occasionally give them clothes if they {{know where they are}} living. Also, the boys among them do not mind wandering fully or partially naked in public because it adds to the people's sympathy for them.|$|E

25|$|Unrest {{continued}} in the South. In October 1948, the Yeosu–Suncheon Rebellion took place, in which some regiments rejected {{the suppression of the}} Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government. In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the Bodo League in order {{to keep an eye on}} its political opponents. The majority of the Bodo League's members were innocent farmers and civilians who were forced into membership. The registered members <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> were executed at the beginning of the Korean War. On December 24, 1949, South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers or their family and affixed blame to communists.|$|E
25|$|According to a Human Rights Watch report, the Angolan {{military}} and secret service have committed {{a number of}} human rights violations during the conflict. The report indicates that between September 2007 and March 2009, 38 people were arbitrary detained, tortured, humiliated and later put on trial for alleged security crimes. The arrested included six members of the Angolan military who were charged with desertion and carrying out armed attacks, {{as well as a}} former Voice of America journalist, known for his criticism of the government. The detainees were denied contact with legal professionals <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> for prolonged periods of time. The above are considered to be a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|E
25|$|Deeply {{affected}} by his dismissal from the Academy, Eakins' later career focused on portraiture, {{such as his}} 1905 Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes. His steadfast insistence on his own vision of realism, {{in addition to his}} notoriety from his school scandals, combined to hurt his income in later years. Even as he approached these portraits with the skill of a highly trained anatomist, what is most noteworthy is the intense psychological presence of his sitters. However, it was precisely for this reason that his portraits were often rejected by the sitters <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> As a result, Eakins came to rely on his friends and family members to model for portraits. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1887–1888) was the poet's favorite.|$|E

25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, Komnas HAM {{released}} {{another report}} indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, {{should be investigated}} for their involvement; it called for an ad hoc tribunal {{to look into the}} matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (islah) with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.|$|E
25|$|The panel {{conducted}} its investigations throughout several months, {{relying on}} first-hand witnesses and victims {{as the primary}} source of information. Eighty escapees, refugees, and abductees publicly testified, and 240 more were interviewed confidentially to protect them <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> from retaliation by North Korea. Interviews were conducted during visits to Seoul, Tokyo, Bangkok, London, and Washington, D.C., and through videoconferences and telephone calls. A wealth of other reports and written materials prepared by the UN, NGOs, governments, research institutes, and academics were used for context and corroboration. Historical official documents released from former Soviet countries (including archival records from the USSR) and leaked records from China and DPRK also fed into the commission's research. The Commission also relied on commercially available satellite images of prison camps, as well as clandestinely recorded videos and photographs with confirmed authenticity.|$|E

25|$|In Isleta, Lummis {{divorced}} {{his first}} wife and married Eva Douglas, {{who lived in the}} village and was the sister-in-law of an English trader. Somehow he convinced Eva to stay with Dorothea in Los Angeles until the divorce went through. In the meantime, Lummis became entangled in fights with the U.S. government agents over Indian education. In this period, the government was pushing assimilation and had established Indian boarding schools. It charged its agents with recruiting Native American children for the schools, where they were usually forced to give up traditional clothing and hair styles, and prevented from speaking their own languages or using their own customs. They were often prohibited from returning home during holidays or vacation periods, <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> were too poor to afford such travel. Lummis persuaded the government to allow 36 children from the Albuquerque Indian School to return to their homes.|$|E
25|$|Children {{also face}} dangers online such as {{cyberbullying}} and approaches by sexual predators, who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material {{which they may}} find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable Internet filtering, and/or supervise their children's online activities, {{in an attempt to}} protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.|$|E
25|$|Based on her account, {{claiming}} to have been raped by several black men, the police quickly arrested Frank Hairston, Jr. and Booker Millner. Four more suspects were arrested that night, {{based in part on}} the first two men's confessions. By the next morning, all the men in custody had signed confessions. The last to be arrested, Joe Hampton, was taken into custody on January 10. All but one man was in his early 20s. After being held by police overnight, the first six all signed confessions, implicating themselves and each other. All admitted to being present at the crime, including Joe Hampton, although not all took part in rape. Only one of the accused had a prior criminal record, and most of the men were employed. When the NAACP appealed their convictions, its defense team noted that the police had questioned the men who had been drinking for some time, and without allowing them to consult with lawyers <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E
