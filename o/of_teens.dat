25|$|A rainbow {{party is}} an urban legend spread {{from the early}} 2000s. At these events, {{allegedly}} increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of lipstick take turns fellating males in sequence, leaving multiple colours on their penises.

On May 27, 2010 the television program The Doctors discussed the topic with dozens <b>of</b> <b>teens,</b> parents, and professionals. However, sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and as such attribute the spread of the stories to a moral panic.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006.

However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world.
