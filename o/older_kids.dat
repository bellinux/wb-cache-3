Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm not the greatest father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E

In the episode, Bart cuts the head off the statue of Jebediah Springfield {{in the center of}} town to impress Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph, three <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> he admires. The town's residents, including the three boys, are horrified and Bart regrets his actions. After telling his family, Homer and Bart head to the center of town, where they are met by an angry mob. After Bart tells the mob he has made a mistake, the townspeople forgive Bart and he places the head back on the statue.

[...] Wilmington {{described it as a}} [...] "dingy, drab, pointless little movie ... made without flair or imagination, seemingly enervated by its own bad taste and low intentions". [...] Canby called the screenplay and direction amateurish, and Hicks wrote that Jones is bereft of ideas and should go back to his day job, describing the plot as [...] "by-the-numbers killings with no rhyme or reason". [...] Harrington wrote that the film [...] "has major continuity and credibility problems". [...] Strauss identified the theme as anti-greed but said the writing is [...] "simultaneously prosaic and murky", causing Jones to miss his mark. [...] Wilmington wrote that the leprechaun's cries for his gold reflects the filmmakers' cynical desire for box office success. [...] Sight & Sound described Leprechaun as a film which seems to have no concept of a target audience, stating, [...] "Jones wants this to be a lively romp for <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> in the mould of Time Bandits...but also wants to corner the lucrative horror market."

500|$|The {{finished}} {{pilot was}} 28 minutes long, which {{was too long}} to air, as Parker and Stone {{did not realize that}} more time should be allowed for television commercials during the half-hour spot reserved for an episode on Comedy Central. In order to shorten the episode to 22 minutes, the creators cut out about ten minutes worth of material, and added back another three minutes, in order to tie up the changed storyline. For example, in the original pilot, Cartman farts fire because some <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> feed him hot tamales, while in the shortened version, he does so because of the alien probe implanted in him. Other scenes focused more heavily on the character Pip. The scene where he is introduced was later inserted into the fifth episode of the series, [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig", in its original, cutout animation form. The storyline additions were created with the use of computer animation, and all subsequent episodes of the series have been computer animated. While the creators' aim was for the computer animation to visually simulate the cardboard cutout animation, the techniques were not perfected until later in the series, and as a result, the two styles of animation are easily distinguishable in the pilot.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2013, a new CGI special titled Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed was {{announced}} to premiere that year, {{though it was}} later delayed to January 20, 2014. The former Beatle Ringo Starr promoted the special on Cartoon Network singing a new original song [...] "I Wish I Was a Powerpuff Girl" [...] with previews {{leading up to the}} airdate. Ringo also voiced a new character named Fibonacci Sequins in the episode. The special was directed by Dave Smith, who directed episodes for the series in the past, and featured the original cast members reprising their roles. This Powerpuff Girls special marked the first time that series creator Craig McCracken had no input. The episode's plot has Mojo Jojo kidnap Fibonacci along with an opera singer and a badger. The girls rescue all of them, and the powerpuff girls defeat Mojo yet again with his kidnapping plan.

40|$|Small {{ruminants}} husbandry {{in traditional}} flocks in Cameroon First part : Productivities. After a one year survey among West African Dwarf {{sheep and goats}} in four villages and seven flocks of the North-West province of Cameroon, the constraints to increased productivity were studied. Because of agricultural activities leaving little time and few fields to guarantee good feeding and breeding management, mortalities were high, especially in kids and lambs, which limited the production. Reproductive performances, animal viability and body weights were combined to obtain three overal productivity indices for two flocks of goats. The first one was characterized by long intervals between parturitions (14 months) and lower productivity indices (14, 7 kg of one year <b>old</b> <b>kid</b> per dam per year) than the second flock where goats were bred with a Toggenburg buck (47, 1 kg of one year <b>old</b> <b>kid</b> per dam per year).

2500|$|While {{there remains}} a general gap in the {{literature}} regarding the production of facial expressions and the processes which underlie this production at middle childhood and adolescence ages, research has been done to assess the overall production capabilities of children ranging in ages 5–13. Results generally indicate that the ability to produce facial emotion increases with age and is slightly correlated with the ability to discriminate the facial expressions of another. Odom and Lemond (1972) created a study to test the potential for [...] "a developmental lag between the perception and production of facial expressions," [...] meaning they were looking to uncover a relationship between previously created schemas and mental representations of different expressions and the ability to transform these representations into facial expression. They operated using the logical assumption that coding perceptions of expressions comes before the discrimination of expressions which then precedes production. Upon assessing two differing age groups, one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade, they discovered that there is a lag between perception and production of facial expressions, however this lag does not decrease with age. Production and discrimination do not develop at the same rate. [...] Odom and Lemond (1972) have arrived at the far conclusion that production of facial expressions will never be at the same level of discrimination of facial expressions, which supports the findings of another study by Izard (1971) who found that even adults have difficulty producing requested expressions. Despite this, the increased accurate productions of the <b>older</b> <b>kids</b> was found to be due to their discrimination abilities yet the older children still made many errors leading researchers to believe that full discrimination abilities are not at full potential at the middle childhood and adolescence stage of development.|$|E
