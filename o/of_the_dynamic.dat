5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{started the}} 2009–10 season healthy {{for the first}} time since 2007 and quickly made an impact. Playing {{alongside}} Alex Song and Cesc Fàbregas, he became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> three-man midfield partnership. On 22 August 2009, he scored a double in a 4–1 win over Portsmouth. The following month, Diaby assisted on a goal in the team's 3–2 comeback win over Belgian club Standard Liège in the Champions League. After alternating between the bench and starting lineup for the rest of September, in November, Diaby returned to the first eleven and responding by scoring the game-winning goal in a 3–1 win over Birmingham City. Three weeks later, in the Champions League, he netted another goal in a group stage win over Dutch club AZ. On 7 November, Diaby picked up an injury in a 4–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. The injury resulted in the player missing France's World Cup playoff tie with the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a {{new class}} of linear multi-agent network systems, in which nodes are coupled by <b>dynamic</b> edges in <b>the</b> sense that each edge has a dynamic system {{attached}} as well. <b>The</b> outputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>dynamic</b> systems form <b>the</b> external inputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> node <b>dynamic</b> systems, which are termed "neighboring inputs" representing the coupling actions between nodes. <b>The</b> outputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> node <b>dynamic</b> systems are <b>the</b> inputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>dynamic</b> systems. Several cooperative output regulation problems are posed, including output synchronization, output cooperation and master-slave output cooperation. Output cooperation is specified as making the neighboring input, a weighted sum of edge outputs, track a predefined trajectory by cooperation of node outputs. Distributed cooperative output regulation controllers depending on local state and neighboring inputs are presented, which are designed by combining feedback passivity theories and the internal model principle. A simulation example on the cooperative current control of an electrical network illustrates <b>the</b> potential applications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analytical results.

25|$|Transcriptomic {{analysis}} has predominantly focused {{on either the}} host or the pathogen. Dual RNA-Seq has recently been applied to simultaneously profile RNA expression in both the pathogen and host throughout the infection process. This technique enables the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> response and interspecies gene regulatory networks in both interaction partners from initial contact through to invasion and the final persistence of the pathogen or clearance by the host immune system.|$|E

25|$|The {{systematic}} treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{behavior of}} interconnected bodies {{has led to}} a large number of important multibody formalisms in the field of mechanics. The simplest bodies or elements of a multibody system were treated by Newton (free particle) and Euler (rigid body). Euler introduced reaction forces between bodies. Later, a series of formalisms were derived, only to mention Lagrange’s formalisms based on minimal coordinates and a second formulation that introduces constraints.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} output-limiting circuits, the RO {{is placed in}} the top (series connection) or lower (shunt) arm of the voltage divider. The series connection provides a greater controlling range (−80dB) at DC and low frequencies. The operation is complicated by the nonlinearity of the resistance vs. the controlling current. The narrowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> range due to the parasitic capacitance is significant at frequencies as low as hundreds of Hz. The reaction is significantly faster to the increase than decrease in the controlling current.|$|E

25|$|The {{parameterization}} {{of these}} very coarse-grained models must be done empirically, by matching {{the behavior of the}} model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both enthalpic and entropic contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> description may be less reliable. But very coarse-grained models have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.|$|E
25|$|In wind engineering, {{wind tunnel}} tests {{are used to}} measure the {{velocity}} around, and forces or pressures upon structures. Very tall buildings, buildings with unusual or complicated shapes (such as a tall building with a parabolic or a hyperbolic shape), cable suspension bridges or cable stayed bridges are analyzed in specialized atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels. These feature a long upwind section to accurately represent the wind speed and turbulence profile acting on the structure. Wind tunnel tests provide the necessary design pressure measurements in use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> analysis and control of tall buildings.|$|E
