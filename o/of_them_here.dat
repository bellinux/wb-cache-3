2500|$|The {{strike and}} the {{subsequent}} Snow Riot in the District [...] exacerbated [...] long standing white fears of black workers on the navy yard. [...] In an undated diary entry for August 1835, African American diarist Michael Shiner confirms intimidation by white workers and their demand that the black caulkers stop work: [...] "Commodore Hull ishsared and evry one of them struck and said they wouldnt work anny moore {{and at the same}} time they were collered man from Baltimore by the name of Israel Jones a caulker by Trade he was the forman Caulker of those Colerded Caulkers and they where fifteen or twenty <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>here</b> at that time Caulkin on the Columbia and the Carpenters made all of them knock oft two." [...] As Michael Shiner wrote the white workers blamed Hull for bringing in black caulkers from Baltimore, Maryland and believed that black workers were to be used to break their strike. Hull's report to Dickerson shows the black caulkers did not strike. This and other incidents raised always simmering racial tension in the city and on the navy yard. White mechanics and laborers went on a three day rampage in which they threatened blacks and broke up their businesses and property. [...] On August 14, 1835, he wrote a letter to Dickerson, and expressed some apprehension for the safety of the black caulkers that he recently hired. [...] Rather than make a decision, Hull looked to the Secretary for a solution to his dilemma. [...] "Information has been conveyed to me that the Excitement which has prevailed in the City for some days past is about to be extended to the Neighborhood of the Establishment; the immediate Cause I understand is there are employed in the Yard a number of Blacks, who were in consequence of the Scarcity of Caulkers in this City brought in from Baltimore to caulk the Ship now building.Under the Circumstances I have to request that you will be pleased to give me instructions, Shall I let the Blacks inside the yard and afford them such protection as the force and means at my Command will allow or shall I discharge them and afford them an opportunity to return to Baltimore?" [...] As one historian has noted, Dickerson chose to throw the black caulkers to the mob as he promptly replied, “In answer to your letter of this date, I have to observe that for the present should think it not best to admit the colored people in the Navy Yard at night.” After days of disorder and riot, President Andrew Jackson ordered a company of US Marines to restore order.|$|E
