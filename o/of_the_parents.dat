5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately.

In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E.

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is compared with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon became {{an endangered species}} primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female {{peregrine falcon}}s and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since peregrine falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
40|$|During serial {{passage in}} Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, a substrain of {{influenza}} virus A/WSN is lost from {{the population and}} {{is replaced by a}} mutant virus with altered host cell binding properties. This selection does not occur during growth in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). It occurs during growth in MDBK cells because the parental virus produced by these cells has a dramatically reduced affinity for cellular receptors [Crecelius, D. M., Deom, C. M. & Schulze, I. T. (1984) Virology 139, 164 - 177]. We have now compared the hemagglutinin (HA) subunits, HA 1 and HA 2, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> and mutant viruses by NaDodSO 4 /PAGE and have found that when the viruses are grown in either host cell the HA 1 subunit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutant is smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> virus. <b>The</b> nonglycosylated HAs, made in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> tunicamycin, have <b>the</b> same apparent molecular weight, indicating that the HA 1 subunit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutant virus contains less carbohydrate than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> This reduction in carbohydrate content was observed with 11 independently derived mutants that had been selected by growth in MDBK cells. <b>The</b> nucleotide sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HA gene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> and mutant viruses indicates that there are five potential glycosylation sites on <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> HA 1 subunit and four on the mutant and that the mutation responsible for this difference is a single base change that eliminates the glycosylation site at amino acid 125 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> HA 1 subunit. Treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> and mutant HAs from both cell sources with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases F and H showed that <b>the</b> HA 1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> virus has four complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharides, whereas that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutant virus has three complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharides. Thus, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential sites on both HA 1 subunits are glycosylated. We conclude that the oligosaccharide attached to amino acid 125 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> HA by MDBK cells can reduce <b>the</b> affinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus for cellular receptors and that the mutant virus has a higher affinity than <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> because <b>the</b> mutant HA is not glycosylated at that site. Since amino acid 125 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> HA is glycosylated by both CEF and MDBK cells, we further conclude that <b>the</b> host-determined structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oligosaccharide at that site affects <b>the</b> affinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> virus for cellular receptors and, thereby, determines whether the mutant virus will have a growth advantage...|$|R

Neighbourhood social capital consists of informal social control and the social cohesion and trust that parents experience in their neighbourhood.

Second, we examined whether temperament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child is related to sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> Third, <b>the</b> moderating effect <b>of</b> child temperament on the relationship between social capital and neighbourhood sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> is examined.

5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E
