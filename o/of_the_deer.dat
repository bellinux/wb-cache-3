5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.

50|$|After {{a heated}} legal {{dispute between the}} federal {{government}} and <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Arizona, hunting was once more permitted, to reduce <b>the</b> <b>deer's</b> numbers. Hunters were able to kill only a small fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starving <b>deer.</b> <b>The</b> range itself was damaged, and its carrying capacity was greatly reduced. Once ecologists began to study the area and reflect on the changes that had occurred there, they began to use <b>the</b> Kaibab <b>deer</b> as a simple lesson about how <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deer's</b> natural predators, which had been done in <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> preserving <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> population, had allowed <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> to over-reproduce, and quickly overwhelm the plateau's resources.

5|$|In the Jataka {{tales of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, there is narration related to his birth as Boddhisattva in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer.

In December 1919, he was accepted as a select member to the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague, opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch. He made many sketches and drawings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deer,</b> and painted Hertje (The fawn) in 1921, which became quite popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired {{a name for himself}} as a talented portraitist. He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d'Azur. His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.|$|E

The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> boom was the addition of man-made open spaces and a deer protection zone put in place from the early 20th century until the 1940s. Annual deer hunts have been held since 1940 in an effort to curb white tail deer population.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Pampas <b>deer</b> {{have been}} {{harvested}} into the millions. [...] Between 1860 and 1870, documents for <b>the</b> port <b>of</b> Buenos Aires alone show that two million Pampas deer pelts {{were sent to}} Europe. [...] Many years later, as roads were built through the pampas, cars made it even easier for poachers to get to <b>the</b> <b>deer.</b> [...] They were also killed for food, medicinal purposes, and for sport. [...] As of 2003, there are fewer than 2,000 of them in Argentina and Uruguay. [...] Both Argentina and Uruguay have declared <b>the</b> Pampas <b>deer</b> [...] "natural monuments" [...] but the hunting continues, although much less frequently now. [...] <b>The</b> decimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pampas <b>deer</b> has been likened to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bison <b>of</b> North America. [...] Also similar to the bison, is the role they played in <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Native Americans <b>of</b> Uruguay and Argentina, being used for food, hides, and medicine. [...] The Native Americans at first participated in <b>the</b> harvesting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pampas <b>deer</b> pelts for sale, and in spite <b>of</b> that, <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> population stayed strong until <b>the</b> Native Americans <b>of</b> those countries were defeated by European settlers.
