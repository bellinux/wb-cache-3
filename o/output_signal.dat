5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E

The proposed system supports multiple speakers in a car. It can be freely configured to obtain different mixed <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> {{that can be}} passed to various speech signal applications. Selected signals can be combined to different <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> by dynamic signal combining, whereas cross-talk components of signals not of interest are cancelled in these <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> within an interfering speaker cancellation approach and proper postprocessing. Furthermore, stationary noise is reduced.|$|R
25|$|Most {{amplifiers}} {{are designed}} to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and <b>output</b> <b>signal.</b> If an amplifier's gain is not linear, the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> can become distorted. There are, however, cases where variable gain is useful. Certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.|$|E

25|$|Automatic {{volume control}} or {{automatic}} gain control (AGC) is an adaptive system found in many electronic devices.

25|$|One {{might say}} {{the second stage}} of the {{amplifier}} is just a voltage follower, transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of R2. That is, the monitored <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> is really the voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view is legitimate, but then the voltage follower stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a measure}} of how much noise is {{introduced}} in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is noise figure or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} {{reliability}} of missile control systems and to prevent self-destruction caused by faulty inertia sensors, a novel approach of fault-tolerant control with signal reconfiguration is proposed. The rigid body angle signals and the different-order elastic oscillation-caused angle signals are first separated from <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> of the inertia sensors with signal processing. Then, {{the relationship between the}} elastic oscillation of the missile body and the attitude angles and the relationship among the <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> of the sensors are analysed. Finally, the normal signal of a faulty sensor is reconfigured with the <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> of other normally working sensors via analytical redundancy.

The representation is delayed at a delay time. The signals (50, 52) respectively occupy 50 percent of the signal (54) and 50 percent of {{the representation of the}} signal (58), in a time interval, and respectively occupy 50 percent of the representation of the signal (58) and 50 -percent of the signal (54) in another time interval. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for producing <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> based on an audio-input signal (2) an audio decoder for producing <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> based on an audio input signal (3) a computer program with a program code for the execution of a method for producing <b>output</b> <b>signals</b> based on an audio input signal. USE - Decorrelator for producing de-correlated signals based on an audio-input signal. ADVANTAGE - The decorrelator effectively de-correlates the <b>output</b> <b>signals,</b> thus improving the signal quality during the presentation of the transient signals. The decorrelator uses small number of arithmetic operations, smaller time delay and smaller number of multiplications for producing the de-correlating signals...|$|R
25|$|The photon {{conversion}} efficiency, {{the number}} of output photons per unit time in the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> or idler wave relative to number of pump photons incident per unit time into the OPO can be high, {{in the range of}} tens of percent. Typical threshold pump power is between tens of milliwatts to several watts, depending on losses of the resonator, the frequencies of the interacting light, the intensity in the nonlinear material, and its nonlinearity. Output powers of several watts can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Amplifiers are {{described}} {{according to the}} properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate. All amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage (voltage gain), output power to input power (power gain), {{or some combination of}} current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in decibels (dB)).|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{current drawn}} into the {{operational}} amplifier from the power supply {{can be used as}} inputs to external circuitry that augment the capabilities of the operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external pushpull amplifier can be controlled by the current {{into and out of the}} operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> well outside of those bounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E
25|$|Different {{power supply}} types result in many {{different}} methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the <b>output</b> <b>signal</b> is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.|$|E
