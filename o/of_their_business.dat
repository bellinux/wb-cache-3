5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>business,</b> or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E

Primary data were collected from the adjacent remote areas of the two selected cities of Khyber Pukhtan Khawa (Abbotabad and Manshera) of Pakistan through structured interviews with enterprise-less women entrepreneurs. The finding of the study suggests that lack of or no understanding about the entrepreneurial process is seriously affecting the enterprising behavior of rural women entrepreneurs in Pakistan.
