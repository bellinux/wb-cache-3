40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} 2 simple {{models for}} the flow generated by a self-propelled flagellate: a sphere propelled by a cylindrical flagellum and one propelled by an external point force. We use these models to examine the role of advection in enhancing feeding rates in 3 situations: (1) <b>osmotroph</b> feeding on dissolved molecules, (2) interception feeding on non-motile prey particles, and (3) interception feeding on motile prey (such as bacteria). We show that the Sherwood number is close to unity for osmotrophic flagellates, as suggested by most previous models. However, a more correct representation of the flow field than that predicted by a naive sinking sphere model leads to substantially higher clearance rates for interception-feeding flagellates. We find that a short flagellum is favourable for interception feeding, but {{at the cost of}} an increase in the drag on the body of the swimming unicell. We finally demonstrate that prey motility significantly enhances prey encounter rates in interception-feeding flagellates and is, in fact, often much more important for food acquisition than the feeding current...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role that}} the marine microbes play in global nutrient cycling, it is necessary to recognize how various phyto- and bacterioplankton groups compete for limiting nutrients. Specific phosphate affinity describes an organism’s ability to harvest phosphate at low concentrations from the surrounding water. For the first time, we have taken advantage of cell-sorting flow cytometry in combination with radio-labeled phosphorus to measure this feature of specific osmotrophic groups in natural communities. Specific phosphate affinities for Synechococcus spp. and picoeukaryotes were measured using live, unstained cells. The results were always lower than theoretical calculated maximum values, corresponding well with observations of P-deficiency, or sub-optimal P supply for the <b>osmotroph</b> community, at the time of investigation. Fixing and staining cells before flow sorting offers the advantage of better separation of phytoplankton and showed high sorting reproducibility when applied to nonaxenic Synechococcuscultures. A subsequent investigation of P-leakage from isotopically labeled, fixed, stained cells in nonaxenic cultures of Synechococcusshowed that it was only slightly larger than the loss of 17 % found when uptake of new label was stopped with adding “cold” phosphate. Possible applications of the currently developed methodology for population specific P affinity measurements by flow sorting are discussed...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedNitrogen (N 2) {{fixation}} is {{an important}} component of the marine nitrogen (N) cycle, as it provides a major source of new N to the oligotrophic ocean, which often N limited. This input could increase global N inventories, leading to the sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 via the biological pump. Any changes in N 2 fixation can therefore theoretically change the carbon (C) sequestration capacity of the ocean. N 2 fixing organisms, like the filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp., are inherently not N limited. One would thus expect diazotrophs to thrive in the oligotrophic oceans; this is not always the case. Something must be limiting N 2 fixation, and both phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) are possible limiting nutrients. However it is not yet clear which nutrient limits N 2 fixers in different locations. With this in mind, a study was undertaken to understand where P can be limiting to Trichodesmium spp. and the relationship between the P cycle and N 2 fixers.; Two assays used as indices of P limitation in Trichodesmium spp. are uptake of 33 PO 43 - to determine maximal P uptake (Vmax) and hydrolysis of P from methylumbelliferone-phosphate to estimate alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). The kinetics of PO 43 - uptake were determined for Trichodesmium spp. colonies in the North Pacific, North Atlantic and in waters north of Australia while APA was determined in the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Trichodesmium spp. Vmax wassignificantly greater (~ 4 fold or more) in the North Atlantic compared to the North Pacific and waters north of Australia when normalized to both Chl a content and number of trichomes per colony. APA in the North Atlantic was also greater than in the North Pacific. Our results indicate that Trichodesmium spp. is more strongly P limited in the North Atlantic compared to the North Pacific or waters along the north coast of Australia. Because P stress is important in the North Atlantic and Trichodesmium spp. colonies are very large, the ability of Trichodesmium spp. to compete for and acquire P is extremely important there. Nano- and pico-plankton present in bulk water samples have a half saturation constant (Ks) for PO 43 - nearly 30 times lower than that of Trichodesmium spp and account for > 99 % of PO 43 - uptake in these waters. However, while chl a normalized alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in bulk water was an order of magnitude greater than in Trichodesmium spp., Trichodesmium contributes substantially to total APA in the water. Trichodesmium is outcompeted for inorganic P, but colonies can satisfy their P needs by supplementing PO 43 - uptake with P cleaved from DOP via alkaline phosphatase.; Having shown that the Trichodesmium spp. in the North Atlantic are P stressed and must exploit the DOP pool to compete with nano- and picoplankton, the question remains if the rest of the <b>osmotroph</b> community is P stressed in the North Atlantic, and what the spatial pattern is over the entire basin. Despite the fact that SRP is elevated in the Amazon River plume in the far western North Atlantic compared to the rest of the basin, PO 43 - turnover times, considered an indicator of P stress, increase from 100 h (less stressed) in the east. This could be due to surface water enrichment in NO 3 - relative to PO 43 - above the Redfield ratio of 16 : 1. Indeed, DIN:SRP ratios in subsurface waters were ~ 60 in the western basin and decreased to ~ 16 in the eastern basin. N enrichment without a concurrent enrichment in P may be a result of N 2 fixation, and published data does indicate that Trichodesmium spp. is more abundant and active in the western basin than the eastern basin. Trichodesmium spp. Vmax of PO 43 - uptake was also high in the west and low in the east, indicating that, by enriching waters in N relative to P, this diazotroph is increasing the competition for P between all organisms of the osmotrophic community, including themselves...|$|E

They lived in low-flow environments, fueled by uptake [1 – 3] of dissolved reactants (osmotrophy). However, prokaryotes are effective <b>osmotrophs,</b> and {{the advantage of}} taller eukaryotic <b>osmotrophs</b> in this deep-water community context has not been addressed. We reconstructed flow-velocity profiles and vertical mixing using canopy flow models appropriate to the densities of the observed communities. Further modeling of processes at organismal surfaces documents increasing uptake with height in {{the community as a}} function of thinning of the diffusive boundary layer with increased velocity. The velocity profile, produced by canopy flow in the community, generates this advantage of upward growth. Alternative models of upward growth advantage based on redox/resource gradients fail, given the efficiency of vertical mixing. In benthic communities of <b>osmotrophs</b> of sufficient density, access to flow in low-flow settings provides an advantage to taller architecture, providing a selectional driver for communities of tall eukaryotes in contexts where phototropism cannot contribute to upward growth. These Ediacaran deep-sea fossils were preserved during the increasing oxygenation prior to the Cambrian radiation of animals and likely represent an important phase in the ecological and evolutionary transition to more complex eukaryotic forms.

40|$|The {{biogeochemistry}} {{of carbon}} and nutrients (N,P) {{in the surface}} layer of the ocean strongly depends on the complex interactions between primary producers (phytoplankton) and remineralizers (heterotrophic bacteria). To understand how these interactions impact the overall DOC dynamics in the surface layer of the Mediterranean Sea, we implemented, using Eco 3 M (Ecological Mechanistic Modular Modelling tool), a multi-element model with a mechanistic description of primary production. We studied the model steady state results under various nutrient conditions and fixed cell abundances.

The larger size fraction (> 0. 8 ?m), mainly consisting of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi, but also including an increasing amount of large particle-associated bacteria as the bloom proceeded, dominated uptake of the inorganic forms NH 4 +, NO 3 ?, and PO 4 3 ?. The uptake of N from leucine, and P from ATP and dissolved DNA (dDNA), was initially dominated by the 0. 8 ? 0. 2 ?m size fraction, but shifted towards dominance by the > 0. 8 ?m size fraction as the system turned to an increasing degree of N-deficiency. Normalizing uptake to biomass of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria revealed that organisms in the 0. 8 ? 0. 2 ?m size fraction had higher specific affinity for leucine-N than those in the > 0. 8 ?m size fraction when N was deficient, whereas the opposite was the case for NH 4 +. There was no such difference regarding the specific affinity for P substrates. Since heterotrophic bacteria seem to acquire N from organic compounds like leucine more efficiently than phytoplankton, our results suggest different structuring of the microbial food chain in N-limited relative to P-limited environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We present {{solutions}} for nutrient transfer to <b>osmotrophs</b> {{in the full}} range of flow regimes for which solutions have been published, and we extend some of those solutions to new parameter domains and flow environments. These regimes include stagnant water; steady, uniform flow arising from swimming or sinking; steady shear flows; and fluctuating shear from dissipation of turbulence, as well as the combined effects of turbulence-induced shear and swimming or sinking. Solutions for nutrient fluxes cannot be carried over from one flow regime to another. In all cases, however, mass transfer increases with cell size and with flow velocity. Cell shape becomes particularly important at high flow velocities. For steady, uniform flow arising from sinking or swimming, we find asymptotic analytic and numerical solutions from the engineer-ing literature superior to those in more common use within oceanography. These engineering solutions sug-gest flow effects an order of magnitude smaller than commonly supposed. A cell radius near 20 µm is needed before swimming or sinking can be expected to increase the flux of nutrients, such as nitrate or phos-phate, substantially (by? 50 %) over the stagnant-water case.

During the study, the thermocline gradually declined and vertical mixing started, {{leading to a}} transition from a nutrient-depleted period to a nutrient-replete period. Before vertical mixing started, the orthophosphate turnover time ranged from 1 to 5 h. Orthophosphate uptake was dominated by the 0. 6 – 2 �m size fraction (mean, 70 %), where the cyanobacteria biomass was dominant. The estimated affinity constants for bacteria, cyanobacteria, and autotrophic nanoflagellates ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 028, 0. 047 to 0. 103, and 0. 002 to 0. 032 L nmol P� 1 h� 1 during the period, with relatively short (� 5 h) orthophosphate turnover times.

40|$|Although aquatic {{bacteria}} {{are assumed to}} be nutrient-rich, they out-compete other foodweb <b>osmotrophs</b> for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) an apparent contradiction to resource ratio theory. This paradox could be resolved if aquatic bacteria were demonstrated to be nutrient-poor relative other portions of the planktonic food web. In a survey of > 120 lakes in the upper Midwest of the USA, the nutrient content of bacteria was lower than previously reported and very similar to the Redfield ratio, with a mean biomass composition of 102 : 12 : 1 (C:N:P). Individual freshwater bacterial isolates grown under P-limiting and P-replete conditions had even higher C:P and N:P ratios with a mean community biomass composition ratio of 875 C: 179 N: 1 P suggesting that individual strains can be extremely nutrient-poor, especially with respect to P. Cell-specific measurements of individual cells from one lake confirmed that low P content could be observed at the community level in natural systems with a mean biomass composition of 259 C: 69 N: 1 P. Variability in bacterial stoichiometry is typically not recognized in the literature as most studies assume constant and nutrient-rich bacterial biomass composition. We present evidence that bacteria can be extremely P-poor in individual systems and in culture, suggesting that bacteria in freshwater ecosystems can either play a role as regenerators or consumers of inorganic nutrients and that this role could switch depending on the relationship between bacterial biomass stoichiometry and resource stoichiometry.

The interplay between nutrients and turbulence was also studied by means of two experimental simulations with natural planktonic communities. Experimental nutrient additions varied both in terms of total nutrient load and in the balance of elements, with a particular focus on N sources. In the experiments, shifts in community composition appeared to be mostly related to the interaction between turbulence and N partitioning: under still conditions, ammoniumrich waters favored small organisms and reinforced the microbial loop, whereas nitrate mostly favored diatom growth. Turbulence added complexity to the final outcome, because mixing tended to favor large over small <b>osmotrophs.</b> The results suggested that the rapid growth of small autotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria in ammonium-rich waters could be partly counteracted by diatom increases if nutrient pulses were coupled with turbulent mixing, and diatom bursts after nitrate enrichments could be largely enhanced by concomitant turbulence.

40|$|Farm Aar in Namibia {{contains}} {{a sequence of}} rocks from the late Ediacaran Nama Group. This site has produced {{a large number of}} fossils of Ernietta plateauensis and Pteridinium simplex. These two forms are incompletely characterised in the literature. Pteridinium was an elongate, three-vaned organism. It had a rubbery, semi-rigid consistency evidenced {{by the fact that it}} will bend, but does not fold or tear except at distinct points of weakness. It is tri-symmetric around the central axis. There is a distinctive offset symmetry along this axis where the vanes meet. The vanes are relatively thin and made up of parallel tubes, which are arranged in double-layers. This double-layer of tubes is also found in Ernietta. Ernietta was a sac-shaped organism with the same offset symmetry along a suture at the base of the sac, where sets of parallel tubes meet each other. Both of these organisms are found in Nama-style preservation – a taphonomy in which soft-bodied organisms are preserved three-dimensionally in sands and muds. Pteridinium is preserved within event beds, above scours where massive sand has been deposited and within waning (but still upper flow regime) flows depositing sand laminae. Ernietta is also preserved in transported deposits, but can be found on Aar in original life position, where fossils have been buried more gradually by mud. It is likely that the three-dimensional form of these organisms was preserved by the early lithification of surrounding sediment as a result of the precipitation of pyrite in association with bacterial metabolism. Both forms are also associated with membrane-like and bag-like structures. Farm Aar also bears domal structures – sedimentary structures that may represent a new form of biologically influenced soft-sediment deformation. The dual-layer of tubes making up the body walls of Ernietta and Pteridinium represents a synapomorphy unique to the Erniettomorpha. These two forms are the first-named members of this clade, which also includes the Namibian form Swartpuntia germsi and the South Australian form Phyllozoon hanseni. Swartpuntia represents a highly derived, late-appearing erniettomorph, while Phyllozoon may or may not represent a trace fossil form of Pteridinium. In either case, it is interesting in being preserved in a contrasting taphonomic setting – 'Flinders-style' preservation – to most other known erniettomorphs. The closest relatives to the erniettomorphs within the Ediacara biota are likely to be the rangeomorphs and dickinsoniomorphs. The key differences between the erniettomorphs and dickinsoniomorphs centre on the dual-layer of tubes, and the semi-rigid construction of erniettomorphs, which contrasts with the tendency of dickinsoniomorphs to fold and to be found draping small-scale sea-bed topography. Erniettomorphs were most likely osmotrophic organisms.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) in surface waters {{originates}} from allochthonous and autochthonous sources, {{the latter of}} which includes exudation by phytoplankton, viral lysis of planktonic organisms and 'sloppy' feeding by zooplankton. The concentration of DOM in seawater exceeds by one to two orders of magnitude that of particulate organic matter. Thus the DOM pool may be crucial to nutrition of pelagic <b>osmotrophs,</b> such as bacteria and algae, which are capable of exploiting dissolved organic substrates. In this thesis, monitoring surveys and laboratory experiments were {{used to examine the}} seasonal dynamics of DOM, including interactions of DOM and heterotrophic bacteria, in the Gulf of Finland, northern Baltic Sea, which is rich in allochthonous humic DOM. Despite the large ambient DOM pools and their potentially marked influence in the planktonic food webs and biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients, few investigations in the Baltic Sea have focused on the dynamics of DOM, and information from the Gulf of Finland is almost lacking. In this thesis, seasonal changes in the net pools of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON) and P (DOP) were followed along with ambient key physical, chemical and biological variables on a shore-to-open-sea salinity gradient once in January and biweekly during the phytoplankton growth season. Horizontal coverage of these data was complemented with DOM samplings along a transect from the western to {{the eastern part of the}} Gulf. Autochthonous DOM accumulated throughout the productive season and the accumulated DOM was N- and P-rich compared with the bulk DOM pool in the surface layer of the Gulf of Finland. Notable DOM accumulation occurred during the actively growing and declining phases of spring and late summer blooms. Total export estimates of surface DOC, DON and DOP by autumn overturn corresponded to about 11 25 % of reported annual particulate organic matter sedimentation in our study area. Seasonal variation in the availability of the net DOC and DON pools for bacterial utilization was investigated with incubations of natural bacterial samples for 2 3 wk. The concentrations of labile DOC were low in spring and during the summer minimum period, whereas the pools of labile DON were more variable. The labile DOM accumulated during and after the late summer cyanobacterial bloom, with low C:N ratios. For determination of factors that control the net DOM pools, limitation of bacterial growth by inorganic nutrients (N and P), labile C and temperature was followed in natural surface and deep-water bacterial samples during the main postspring bloom stages of phytoplankton growth. Agreeing with the low degradability of the ambient DOC pool, bacterial production was consistently C-limited in the surface layer, with N or both N and P as the secondary limiting nutrients from spring to early summer and in late summer, respectively. In deep water, bacterial growth showed combined temperature and C limitation. Sunlight induces photochemical transformation of DOM, and the importance of this process to bacterial growth during summer was investigated with samples representing extensive spatial and temporal coverage. In addition, photochemical transformation of refractory DOM and its effects on growth and composition of the microbial community were studied in further detail during a late summer cyanobacterial bloom. Photochemical transformation of DOM generally resulted in increased bacterial production, and photoproduced labile DOC was estimated to support 95 %) helposti saatavilla olevasta typestä on DON-varannossa.

40|$|The term protist {{describes}} an informal grouping of unicellular eukaryotic organisms {{that do not}} form tissues. With a tremendous diversity in morphology and ecology, they represent {{the vast majority of}} eukaryotic heterogeneity of which only a small fraction is yet known. Ubiquitously dispersed in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats they occupy various ecological niches as e. g. primary producers, <b>osmotrophs,</b> bacterivores, fungivores, algivores, omnivores, predators or parasites of e. g. animals and plants. However, methodological drawbacks in culturing impeded research of protists. Research focused on the easily culturable taxa, especially bacterivores and algae, leading to a skewed image of protist diversity and many ‘unculturable’ protist taxa are still unknown to science. Therefore we focused on protists with unusual feeding types (in particular bacterivorous sit-and-wait predators and eukaryvorous predators) in the phylum Cercozoa. The Cercozoa CAVALIER-SMITH 1998, were discovered to be closely related based on molecular analyses although being highly divergent in morphology and ecology. Molecular surveys revealed a high genetic diversity in the Cercozoa of which only a small fraction can yet be linked to morphological data. Based on culture material, cell morphology, feeding processes and life history stages of several cercozoan amoebae have been studied by us. This was achieved by using mainly light microscopy and time-lapse photography but also ultra structure data was obtained. Genetic markers, e. g. SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA were subjected to phylogenetic analyses to draw conclusions on cercozoan evolution. Based on six isolates from German and Spanish soils a novel lineage of bacterivorous amoebae was described. Kraken carinae gen. nov. sp. nov. is an amoeba distinguished by a scale bearing cell body (usually < 10 µm in diameter) and a network of filopodia (up to 0. 5 mm in diameter). K. carinae {{is one of the few}} known sit-and-wait predators in the Cercozoa, preying on bacteria that get in contact with its large filopodia network. Unlike other cercozoan amoebae that usually use the filopodia to drag prey to their cell bodies for ingestion, K. carinae ingests bacteria directly at the point of contact and transports them through the filopodia to the cell body for digestion. SSU rDNA phylogeny showed an affinity to the order Cercomonadida in the class Sarcomonadea with only weak support, but a concatenated approach, by combining SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA sequences, confirmed the results with higher (though still moderate) support, in particular with the family Paracercomonadidae. However, Kraken carinae still remains incertae sedis as ultrastructure revealed the presence of scales, a morphological character predominantly known from the class Imbricatea, contradicting the phylogenetic results. By combining literature research with phylogenetic examination focusing on Lecythium (HERTWIG et LESSER, 1874) and its family the Chlamydophryidae (DE SAEDELEER 1934) we were able to clarify the confusing taxonomy of genera like Plagiophrys, Lecythium, Rhizaspis and others. All of these amoebae bear a flexible organic theca, branching and anastomosing filopodia. However, they differ in cell shape and show species (or strain) specific feeding preferences. SSU rDNA phylogenies reflected the phenotypic differences between those genera but also revealed surprising results: The genera Lecythium (Novel Clade 4) and Rhizaspis (Tectofilosida) were polyphyletic and had to be separated, resulting in a secession of Fisculla gen. nov. (Tectofilosida) from Lecythium and Sacciforma gen. nov. (Cryomonadida) from Rhizaspis. As these thecofilosean amoebae, similar to the predominantly known eukaryvores in the Cercozoa, the Vampyrellida, have been shown to be eukaryvorous, we further focused on eukaryvorous protists in terrestrial habitats, by investigating (a) their feeding preferences (b) their physiological requirements to consume eukaryotic prey and (c) their dispersal in terrestrial and freshwater systems. This was achieved by conducting thorough sampling, observing individuals in their unaltered sample (if possible) and performing experiments on feeding preference, chemical sensing, and enzyme production with several omnivorous or eukaryvorous Cercozoa. In laboratory experiments, we could show that the eukaryvorous protist Fisculla terrestris is able to sense and select its preferred prey and produce a battery of enzymes needed to digest cell wall compounds of eukaryotes, such as chitin. F. terrestris preferred fungal prey (in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and only fed to a small extend on algae. To get more insight into the dispersal of eukaryvorous protists in terrestrial systems, we screened metatranscriptomes of different terrestrial habitats for the eukaryvorous Vampyrellida and Grossglockneriidae, showing high dispersal, since they were present in all screened habitats, with up to 3...|$|R
