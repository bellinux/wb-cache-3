5|$|The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1812, by the French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The species name javanicus refers to its place of origin. However, the species was not recognized for long; by 1840, René Primevère Lesson classified {{it as one}} of several varieties of a single species <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> loris, which he called Bradylemur tardigradus. In 1921, Oldfield Thomas named a second species <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> loris from Java, Nycticebus ornatus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> lorises for medicinal purposes.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that neuronal oscillations at different frequencies {{interact with each other}} in terms of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). In particular, the phase <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> oscillations modulates the power of faster oscillations. This is referred to as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Examples are alpha phase to gamma power coupling as observed in humans and theta phase to gamma power coupling as observed in the rat hippocampus. We here ask if the interaction between alpha and gamma oscillations is {{in the direction of the}} phase <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> oscillations driving the power of faster oscillations or conversely from the power of faster oscillations driving the phase <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> oscillations. To answer this question, we introduce a new measure to estimate the cross-frequency directionality (CFD). This measure is based on the phase-slope index (PSI) between the phase <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> oscillations and the power envelope of faster oscillations. Further, we propose a randomization framework for statistically evaluating the coupling measures when controlling for multiple comparisons over the investigated frequency ranges. The method was firstly validated on simulated data and next applied to resting state electrocorticography (ECoG) data. These results demonstrate that the method works reliably. In particular, we found that the power envelope of gamma oscillations drives the phase <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> oscillations in the alpha band. This surprising finding is not easily reconcilable with theories suggesting that feedback controlled alpha oscillations modulate feedforward processing reflected in the gamma ban...|$|R

5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs.

Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E

However, after eight days <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E

After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors.

The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E

In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{reached the}} {{pinnacle}} of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt. In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.|$|E
40|$|Motor nerve {{conduction}} velocity of the ulnar nerve was measured in 54 infants of various ages. Conduction velocity <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> fibres was measured using Hopf's technique, and maximal {{conduction velocity}} was measured with the usual method. Both maximal conduction velocity and conduction velocity <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> fibres increased with maturation. The former was about 65 m/s {{at the age of}} about 3 - 5 years, but thereafter it decreased slightly to about 60 m/s. Conduction velocity <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> fibres increased gradually until about 3 or 4 years of age, and then ranged about 40 - 50 m/s. The difference between the two velocities increased until 7 or 9 months of age; during the next 8 years, it tended to decrease to about 8 - 16 m/s. The increasing difference in size between the largest and the smallest myelinated fibres with maturation correlated with the developmental increase of the difference between maximal conduction velocity and conduction velocity <b>of</b> <b>slower</b> fibres. The anatomical evidence of the slight decrease of the axon diameter of the large fibres at the age of 7 - 14 years may correspond to the slight reduction of maximal conduction velocity after about 5 years of age...|$|R
