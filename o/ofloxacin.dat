25|$|Levofloxacin is the levo isomer of the {{racemate}} <b>ofloxacin,</b> another quinolone antimicrobial agent. Levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is {{the pure}} (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic <b>ofloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of the {{endogenous}} compounds that have been reported to be affected by <b>ofloxacin</b> as inhibitors, alteraters and depletors. See the latest package insert for <b>Ofloxacin</b> for additional details.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, {{being one}} of the isomers of <b>ofloxacin,</b> which was a broader-spectrum conformationally locked analog of norfloxacin; both <b>Ofloxacin</b> and levofloxaxin were {{synthesized}} and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. The Daiichi scientists knew that <b>ofloxacin</b> was racemic, but tried unsuccessfully to separate the two isomers; in 1985 they succeeded in separately synthesizing the pure levo form and showed that it was less toxic and more potent than the other form.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>ofloxacin</b> in {{the tablet}} form is approximately 98% following oral administration reaching maximum serum concentrations within {{one to two}} hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of <b>ofloxacin</b> is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. However, four to eight percent of an <b>ofloxacin</b> dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion as well. Plasma elimination half-life is approximately 4 to 5 hours in patients and approximately 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the product}} package insert, <b>ofloxacin</b> is {{effective}} against the following microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> was {{patented}} in 1980 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Ofloxacin</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.27 USD per month. In the United States a course of treatment costs about 50 to 100 USD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was {{synthesized}} {{and developed}} by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} {{administration of}} a {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} with a quinolone, including <b>ofloxacin,</b> may {{increase the risk of}} CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures.|$|E
25|$|Careful {{monitoring}} of serum glucose is advised when <b>ofloxacin</b> or other fluorquinolones {{are used by}} people who are taking sulfonylurea anti-diabetes drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> is a racemic mixture, which {{consists}} of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Caution in {{patients}} with liver disease. The excretion of <b>ofloxacin</b> may be reduced {{in patients}} with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites).|$|E
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on overdose with <b>ofloxacin.</b> Current advise {{for the management}} of an acute overdose of <b>ofloxacin</b> is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as renal failure and seizure. Seizures have however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage as well as severe psychiatric reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> is also {{considered}} to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, no {{adequate}} and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. <b>Ofloxacin</b> {{should be used}} during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, under {{licensed}} use, <b>ofloxacin</b> is {{now considered}} to be contraindicated {{for the treatment of}} certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> has {{not been}} shown to be {{effective}} in the treatment of syphilis. Floxin is no longer considered a first line treatment for gonnorrhea due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to <b>ofloxacin</b> {{and other}} fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during {{a course of}} treatment. Numerous pathogens, {{including}} Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes now exhibit resistance worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> for {{systemic}} use {{is available}} as tablet (multiple strengths), oral solution (250mg/mL), and injectable solution (multiple strengths). It {{is also used}} as eye drops and ear drops. It is also available in combination with ornidazole.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones have varying {{specificity}} for cytochrome P450, and so {{may have}} interactions with drugs cleared by those enzymes; the order from most P450-inhibitory to least, is enoxacin > ciprofloxacin > norfloxacin > <b>ofloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin,</b> {{like some}} other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug {{metabolizing}} enzymes and thereby increase {{blood levels of}} other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophyline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels {{may result in a}} greater risk of side effects.|$|E
25|$|When {{taken by}} mouth common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, {{numbness}} due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. <b>Ofloxacin</b> {{is in the}} fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA.|$|E
25|$|Daiichi and J also cannibalized its own {{market by}} {{introducing}} levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of <b>ofloxacin,</b> in 1996; Johnson and Johnson's {{annual sales of}} Floxin in 2003 was approximately $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson & Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> {{should be}} {{administered}} as described within the Dosage Guidelines table {{found within the}} most current package insert. The status of the patient’s renal function and hepatic function {{must also be taken}} into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. <b>Ofloxacin</b> is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver. Modification of the dosage is required using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function (Particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction). However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection and the usual duration is 7 to 14 days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> has {{not been}} shown to have any {{teratogenic}} effects at oral doses as high as 810mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160mg/kg/day (4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360mg/kg/day (5 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of <b>ofloxacin</b> (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein this includes pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when there is a hole in the ear drum.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid ear drops {{may be used}} as a {{preventative}} measure. Treatment {{of acute}} cases is typically with antibiotic drops, such as <b>ofloxacin</b> or acetic acid. Steroid drops may be used in addition to antibiotics. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used for the pain. Antibiotics by mouth are not recommended unless the person has poor immune function or there is infection of the skin around the ear. Typically, improvement occurs within a day of the start of treatment. Treatment of chronic cases depends on the cause.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and {{potentially}} permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy {{is not recommended}} risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in the class appear okay in breastfeeding; however, the safety of levofloxacin is unclear. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It usually results in death of the bacteria. It is the left sided isomer of the medication <b>ofloxacin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ofloxacin</b> is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both ...|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. <b>ofloxacin</b> is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of bacterial infections such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} for marketing in Japan in 1993 for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under {{the brand name}} Cravit. [...] Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson as it had with <b>ofloxacin,</b> obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial choice}} of {{antibiotic}} depends upon personal choice, experience and availability, but could include chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP), ciprofloxacin, <b>ofloxacin</b> and tobramycin. [...] Topical gentamicin formulations are also available, {{but in the}} opinion of some, should be reserved for cases with stromal melting. [...] Frequency of application can vary from q1h to q8h, depending on both the severity of the lesion, and the formulation used (ointment vs. drops).|$|E
2500|$|... "After multiple-dose {{administration}} of 200mg and 300mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 μg/mL and 3.6 μg/mL, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. In vitro, approximately 32% {{of the drug}} in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. <b>Ofloxacin</b> has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces." ...|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{exhibits}} enhanced activity {{against the}} important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae relative to earlier fluoroquinolone derivatives like ciprofloxacin. [...] For this reason, {{it is considered}} a [...] "respiratory fluoroquinolone" [...] along with more recently developed fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. [...] It is less active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lacks the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. Levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes, and is about twice as potent as <b>ofloxacin</b> against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium avium complex.|$|E
2500|$|Oral and {{intravenous}} <b>ofloxacin</b> are not licensed {{for use in}} children, {{except as}} noted above, due {{to the risk of}} musculoskeletal injury. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months post-treatment. At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. [...] In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.|$|E
2500|$|Competence is {{specifically}} induced by DNA damaging conditions. [...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA crosslinking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, <b>ofloxacin</b> and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, <b>ofloxacin,</b> or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E
