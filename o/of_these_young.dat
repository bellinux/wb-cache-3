5|$|Such {{treatment}} of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, the prettiest and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> girls and women were lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

25|$|Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836–1886), {{regarded}} as a 19th-century saint, was the inspirator of the Ramakrishna Order of monks and is {{regarded as}} the spiritual founder of the Ramakrishna Movement. Ramakrishna was a priest in the Dakshineswar Kali Temple and attracted several monastic and householder disciples. Narendranath Dutta, who later became Vivekananda was one of the chief monastic disciples. According to Vrajaprana, shortly before his death in 1886 Ramakrishna gave the ochre cloths to his young disciples, who were planning to become renunciates. Ramakrishna entrusted the care <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> boys to Vivekananda. After Ramakrishna's death, the young disciples of Ramakrishna gathered and practised spiritual disciplines. They took informal monastic vows on a night which to their pleasant surprise {{turned out to be the}} Christmas Eve in 1886.|$|E

Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> Representatives took a belligerent {{position}} towards Britain, and Clay was among them. Buoyed by the support of this War Hawk faction, Clay was elected Speaker of the House. He was chosen Speaker {{on the first day of}} his first session, something never done before or since (except for the first ever session of Congress back in 1789). At 34, Clay also became the youngest Speaker, though Robert M. T. Hunter would later win that distinction. Like other Southern Representatives, Clay took domestic slaves to Washington to support his household. The slaves included Aaron and Charlotte Dupuy, their son Charles, and daughter Mary Ann.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena was the Regimental Training Depot of the Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th). Many {{young men}} who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, {{embarked}} upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> men were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures, the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th) merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers. Early in the 1990s the Royal Irish Regiment, whose Regimental Headquarters was at St Patrick's Barracks, was granted the Freedom of the Borough.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{decision}} of the national court a campaign in defense of the house was started. The campaign had been going on ever since the house was sold, but it was only now when facing eviction that the campaign got organized and began focusing on mass-mobilization. As the campaign got more and more attention in the media, the number of people started attending demonstrations in support of the house rapidly increased. The demonstrations grew from a couple of hundred people to numbering several thousands in just a few months. For {{the first time in its}} history, Ungdomshuset experienced massive support from people outside radical left-wing circles. Much of this support came from young people, some of whom had never even visited the house before. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> people was later going to form the main bulk of protesters in the subsequent riots.|$|E
25|$|Navy {{nurses were}} on duty {{during the initial}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Kāneʻohe Bay, the Philippines, Guam, and aboard the Solace; they were vital in {{preventing}} further loss of life and limb. In fact, the nursing profession's vital role was quickly recognized and it became the only women's profession that was deemed so essential as to be placed under the War Manpower Commission. Despite shortages of qualified nurses during the war, the navy was able to hold to its standards and enroll nurses of outstanding qualifications and experience. These outstanding nurses received advanced training in surgery, orthopedics, anesthesia, contagion, dietetics, physiotherapy, and psychiatry, the latter helping men understand and manage Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (then known as shell-shock) and battlefield fatigue. But the navy nurses' duties did not only include the tending to the injured and sick {{but also to the}} equally serious task of training Hospital Corpsmen. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> men had never seen the inside of a hospital unless they themselves had been admitted, and as such it was training from the ground up. Once trained, the men were sent to work aboard fighting ships and on invasion beaches, where nurses were not yet officially assigned. Additionally, nurses trained WAVES for the Hospital Corps.|$|E

500|$|As the {{university}} grew, more buildings were constructed {{on campus and}} a trolley system was built to connect the growing university to downtown Grand Forks. However, there were several major interruptions {{in the life of}} {{the university}}. In 1918, UND was the country's hardest-hit single institution by the flu epidemic that killed 1,400 people in North Dakota alone. Later that year, classes were suspended so the campus could become an army base for soldiers during World War I. During the Great Depression, UND provided free housing to students willing to do manual labor on campus. [...] "Camp Depression," [...] as it was called, consisted of railroad cabooses that housed eight male students each. [...] "Camp Depression" [...] students did not get regular meals from the cafeteria and had to be satisfied with only free leftovers.
