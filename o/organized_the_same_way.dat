[...] This {{was said to}} organize, locate, summarize, and monitor incoming data. Apple argued that this just meant that data was being organized, say, in chronological order—and that was just an abstract idea. Apple said {{this was not a}} computer problem, particularly, and paper documents could be <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> Anyway, the operation could be performed conventionally on a conventional computer. In response, Mirror World argued that streams and substreams were computer concepts not found in the pre-computer world of paper documents. This argument impressed the PTO. The PTO considered that the streams and substreams were manipulated by a computer electronically in a way that did not duplicate prior art paper shuffling, and that improved computer functionality as in Enfish. Therefore, the claims were patent eligible.|$|E
5000|$|Washburn's motor theory {{attempted}} {{to find common}} ground between the structuralist tradition of her mentor, Titchener, which focused exclusively on consciousness and the rising view of behaviorism, which dismissed consciousness in favor of visible actions. Washburn's motor theory argued that all thought {{can be traced back to}} bodily movements. According to her theory, consciousness arises when a motion or a tendency towards movement is partially inhibited by a tendency towards another movement. In the presence of an object, the senses create an impression of it, including vision, sight, feel etc. This is accompanied by an incipient sense of movement, either towards or from the object. Different objects evoke different senses of motor readiness. When the object is not present, memory re-evokes those sensations. Learning consists of an association of movements into a set of regular series and combinations. When two movements become closely linked in quick succession, the sense of movement from the first primes the next, beginning a series. Ideas are <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> Thinking becomes a derivative of movements of the hands, eyes, vocal cords, and trunk muscles (remember the thinker's pose).

5000|$|Madison’s {{vision of}} an {{organized}} and efficient method of representation came to fruition once Federalist 52 was published. It was his methods of organizing the House of Representatives that made it into such {{an important part of}} our government. Madison believed that biennial elections would result in a powerful and more effective form of representation and liberty. He compares his biennial election to the octennial elections that took place, during that time, in Ireland. According to Madison, Ireland received little forms of liberty to their citizens in regards to representation, however, liberty was still present. Madison states that if Ireland’s octennial elections resulted in a form of liberty and representation, then a biennial election would result in a greater amount of liberty and representation for the United States. Of course, biennial elections alone cannot guarantee liberty and fair representation. What would guarantee fair representation is the quality of the candidate chosen for representation. Madison states, in an organized list, the qualifications one should look for in an individual that will make them eligible for candidacy. According to Madison, a candidate, “…must be of the age of twenty-five years: must have been seven years a citizen of the United States: must, {{at the time of his}} election, be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent: and, during the time of his service, must be in no office under the United States.”. [...] It was these qualifications that guaranteed that a proper and professional candidate would be chosen for representation.
