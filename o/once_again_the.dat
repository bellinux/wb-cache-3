5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. <b>Once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>the</b> availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle.
