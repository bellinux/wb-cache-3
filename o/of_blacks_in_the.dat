5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern U.S. {{and an opportunity}} to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 â€“ November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Considered {{by many as the}} first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E

In 1997, the first winery with significant black involvement, New Beginnings was founded in Paarl and was followed by Thandi in Elgin. In 2001 Mont Rochelle Mountain Winery in the Franschhoek Valley became the first wholly black-owned winery in South Africa when it was purchased by Miko Rwayitare, a businessman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

Opposing race riots in northern cities and the lynchings frequent in the South during and immediately {{after the end of}} World War I, Johnson engaged the NAACP in mass demonstrations. He organized a silent protest parade of more than 10,000 African Americans down New York City's Fifth Avenue on July 28, 1917 to protest the still-frequent lynchings <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South.|$|E
25|$|No legal {{restrictions}} {{regarding the}} enlistment of blacks {{were placed on}} the Navy because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Army became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was Louisiana, which gained an exemption {{at the time of its}} purchase through a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law, which ran counter to its traditions and customs. Louisiana permitted the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks.|$|E

25|$|After 18 months, the Congressional {{elections}} committee declared Langston the winner, and he {{took his}} seat in the US Congress. He served for the remaining {{six months of the}} term, but lost his bid for reelection as Democrats regained control of Virginia. Langston was the first black person elected to Congress from Virginia, and he was the last for another century. In a period of increasing disenfranchisement <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, he was one of five African Americans elected to Congress during the Jim Crow era of {{the last decade of the}} nineteenth century. Two were elected from South Carolina and two from North Carolina. After them, no African Americans would be elected to Congress from the South until 1972, after passage of federal civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights for all citizens.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
25|$|In most cities, {{the only}} way blacks could relieve the {{pressure}} of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, {{as well as their}} competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens <b>of</b> <b>blacks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into East St Louis, Illinois, heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.|$|E

500|$|In a {{piece for}} the Berkeley Journal of Sociology, {{academic}} L.

500|$|Leslie {{laid out}} an {{aggressive}} legislative agenda {{in his inaugural}} address to the General Assembly on September 5, 1871, but legislators were more concerned with passing the Southern Railroad bill that would create {{a connection between the}} railroads of Cincinnati, Ohio, and those of the Southern United States. The line would pass through central Kentucky, opening up trade to the region. It would be funded primarily by capital from Ohio, and would provide competition to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad's monopoly in the state. Though Leslie wasn't particularly supportive of the bill, he refused to veto it because of the potential economic benefits to the state. Leslie was also faced with the issue of post-war violence by the Ku Klux Klan. The legislature had refused to pass a law against mob violence in 1871. In his address to the legislature on December 6, 1871, Leslie endorsed legislation that made it illegal to write or post threatening notices and to band together and wear disguises. This proposal enjoyed favorable public opinion, and was passed during the legislature's next session. With the railroad and violence issues resolved, Governor Leslie urged the legislature to improve the status <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, including the creation of an educational system for blacks and the approval of the testimony <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state's courts. He commissioned a new geological survey, appointing native Kentuckian Nathaniel Southgate Shaler to head the work. An advocate of the temperance movement, he secured additional regulations on the sale of liquor. Also during Leslie's tenure, [...] the penal system was improved.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{supported}} a general amnesty for former Confederates, Blaine opposed extending it to include Jefferson Davis, and he cooperated with Grant {{in helping to}} pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in response to increased violence and disenfranchisement <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South. He refrained from voting on the anti-third term resolution that overwhelmingly passed the House that same year, believing that {{to vote for it}} would look self-interested. Blaine was loyal to Grant, and the scandals of the Grant administration did not seem to affect how the public perceived him; according to his biographer, Blaine was never more popular than when he was Speaker of the House. Liberal Republicans saw him as an alternative to [...] the evident corruption of other Republican leaders, and some even urged him to form a new, reformist party. Although he remained a Republican, this base of moderate reformers remained loyal to Blaine and became known as the Half Breed faction of the party.|$|E
500|$|The foreign-policy of the Administration was {{generally}} successful, {{except for the}} attempt to annex Santo Domingo. The annexation of Santo Domingo was President Grant's [...] "not unrealistic" [...] effort to relieve the plight <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South during Reconstruction and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil. The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully, and to the monetary advantage of the United States. Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled. The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish, who was a spokesman for caution and stability. A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish {{was one of the}} greatest Secretraries of States in United States history. Fish was appointed Secretary of State by Grant on March 17, 1869 and served on Grant's Cabinet until the end of Grant's second term on March 4, 1877. Afterwards Secretary Fish briefly served on President Rutherford B. Hayes Cabinet until March 12, 1877.|$|E
