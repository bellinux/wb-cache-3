5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the cave of Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} these may be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{have been used for}} communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.|$|E
5|$|Feathers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups. Based on the current distribution of fossil evidence, it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait, though <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been selectively lost in some species. Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian dinosaur groups, both among saurischians and ornithischians. Simple, branched, feather-like structures are known from heterodontosaurids, primitive neornithischians and theropods, and primitive ceratopsians. Evidence for true, vaned feathers similar to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Feather-like structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs, suggesting the possibility that feather-like filaments may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves. Research into the genetics of American alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess feather-keratins during embryonic development, but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatching.|$|E

25|$|St Michael's present wooden pulpit, tester and altar {{table are}} late 16th or early 17th century. Early in the 17th century the east {{wall of the}} south chapel may have been rebuilt.

25|$|Another common {{variation}} was to distill in {{the presence}} of sulphuric acid. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional aroma of diethyl ether to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create diethyl ether, which also forms an azeotrope with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects – see Paracelsus.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{arbitrarily}} {{many elements}} may be inserted into a linked list, {{limited only by}} the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying array data structure {{and will have to}} reallocate— an expensive operation, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> not even be possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and the cost of an insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.|$|E
25|$|Several {{small step}} pyramids along the Nile river are also {{credited}} to Huni. Those small pyramids had a cultic function and marked important royal estates. They contained no internal chambers {{and were not}} used for burial purposes. One of them {{is located at the}} eastern end of Elephantine island and a granite cone with Huni's name was discovered nearby in 1909. Therefore, this little pyramid is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be credited to Huni with some certainty. Some scholars such as Andrzej Ćwiek contest this attribution however, pointing out that it might be at least possible that the granite cone of Huni was re-used in later times, when ramesside priests restored cultic places of the Old Kingdom period. The only cultic step pyramid that can be definitively connected to an Old Kingdom ruler is a small step pyramid known as the Seila Pyramid, located at the Faiyum Oasis. Two large stela with the name of Snefru were found in front of the pyramid, thus indicating the king responsible for its construction. Since Snefru was Huni's likely immediate successor, this might indicate however that cultic pyramids were indeed constructed at the transition between the 3rd and 4th dynasties.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{have noted}} that the {{narrative}} of the 2009 film Avatar has many similarities to that of The Word for World is Forest. Specific similarities include {{the notion that the}} Earth's resources have been used up, the extraction of resources in an exploitative manner from another planet, a native population on that planet which lives in close harmony with their world, and a rebellion by those natives against the exploitative human colonizers. A key difference lies in the roles of the [...] "benevolent" [...] humans in both works: Raj Lyubov in The Word for World is Forest, Jake Sully and the human scientists in Avatar. While Lyubov made an impression as a [...] "sensible" [...] human and did help mediate peace between the Athshean people and humanity, he is not the savior of their race, and he does not survive to claim any [...] "prize" [...] from it. Additionally, in The Word for World is Forest militarism is regarded by the Athsheans– especially Selver– as an unfortunate but necessary addition to Athshean culture, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> destroy their way of life. In contrast, militarism is seen less critically in Avatar.|$|E

Chris True from AllMusic also gave it an acclaimed review and enjoyed the simple disco and dancepop music of the album, {{saying that there is}} [...] "not one weak track, not one misplaced syrupy ballad to ruin the groove". Alex Needham from NME positively reviewed the album and noted that while the album lacks depth, it is [...] "as effervescent as a foot spa" [...] and that through the album, Minogue [...] "shows the upstarts how it's done". Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media gave it a favourable review and praised its simple and [...] "comfortable" [...] composition, terming it a [...] "mature sound from a mature artist, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation".|$|E

[...] IGN described the game as <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be [...] "amazingly frustrating for the now mainstream Final Fantasy fan," [...] and noted {{that while the}} unique concept of the job system was one that [...] "simply blew gamers' minds" [...] at the time, in the contemporary environment, comparing it to Final Fantasy XIIs license board system was [...] "literally no contest." [...] The review additionally argued that the remake hampered the game, citing that battles that would take [...] "mere seconds to scroll through" [...] were now [...] "lengthened to nearly a minute." [...] Another complaint was in the game's presentation on the Nintendo DS, noting that the handheld's top screen was inactive for [...] "75% of the game," [...] and that even displaying only artwork on the screen during those periods would have been a preferable outcome. However IGN described the game as [...] "graphically phenomenal and...set to a simply beautiful musical score."
