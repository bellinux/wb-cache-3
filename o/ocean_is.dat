5|$|Although the North Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> a {{relatively}} inactive basin, extremely high population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas {{mean that the}} deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Star <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} that is played from a top-down perspective. The player navigates a character throughout the game world, exploring towns and dungeons and interacting with non-player characters. Unlike the original game, the PlayStation Portable remake includes a world map for the player to navigate.|$|E
5|$|The estuary mouth, {{exposed to}} the Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> <b>is</b> a highly dynamic environment, and the sands have been prone to {{dramatic}} shifts during storms. According to tradition, the Doom Bar formed in the reign of Henry VIII, damaging the prosperity of the port of Padstow a mile up the estuary.|$|E
50|$|On February 11, 2005, {{the first}} doubloon <b>ocean</b> <b>was</b> opened. Doubloon <b>oceans</b> <b>are</b> named after shades of green; the current <b>oceans</b> <b>are</b> known as Meridian, Emerald, Opal (German-language), and Jade (Spanish-language).|$|R
50|$|Because the Iapetus <b>Ocean</b> <b>was</b> {{positioned}} between continental masses {{that would}} {{at a much}} later time roughly form the opposite shores of the Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> it can <b>be</b> seen {{as a sort of}} precursor of the Atlantic. The Iapetus <b>Ocean</b> <b>was</b> therefore named for the titan Iapetus, who in Greek mythology was the father of Atlas, after whom the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>was</b> named.|$|R

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
5|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> <b>is</b> {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single {{population of the}} species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E

50|$|The <b>oceans</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} a natural carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Because {{the levels of}} atmospheric carbon dioxide <b>are</b> increasing, the <b>oceans</b> <b>are</b> becoming more acidic.The potential consequences of <b>ocean</b> acidification <b>are</b> not fully understood, but there are concerns that structures made of calcium carbonate may become vulnerable to dissolution, affecting corals {{and the ability of}} shellfish to form shells.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oceans</b> <b>are</b> {{essential}} to transportation. This is {{because most of}} the world's goods move by ship between the world's seaports. <b>Oceans</b> <b>are</b> also the major supply source for the fishing industry. Some of the major harvests are shrimp, fish, crabs, and lobster.|$|R
5|$|Caldas da Rainha has {{a railway}} station {{served by the}} Linha do Oeste (western line) of Comboios de Portugal. Regional trains, which make {{frequent}} local stops, run south to Lisbon, to its suburbs, or to Torres Vedras, and north to Leiria. Interregional trains, which make select stops, run north to Coimbra via Leiria. Salir do Porto, a civil parish on the Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> <b>is</b> the next station north of Caldas and the only other active train stop in the municipality. Former train stops in the municipality are Campo–Serra and Bouro.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> thought to have decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, {{it is thought that}} increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} active basin on the planet, {{accounting}} for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity. Annually, an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater; also, an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period. The basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea. The basin sees activity year-round; however, tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March.|$|E
5|$|The South Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} inhospitable to {{the formation}} of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the South Atlantic Ocean near Brazil, such as the unofficially-named Hurricane Catarina of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels to {{maintain}} their grip on rocks in the <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where we might have liquid water. But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The harbour from Church Point, {{where the}} two arms meet, to the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> {{referred}} to as Sheet Harbour. It is wider than either arm. It is approximately 11-15 metres (36-49 ft) deep at low tide. It gradually widens as it flows southward the Atlantic Ocean. After Church Point, it flows southeast-ward past the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port and west of the small community of Watt Section. It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle.

5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast <b>ocean</b> <b>is</b> formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
