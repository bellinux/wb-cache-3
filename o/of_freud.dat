50|$|Bernays was {{the nephew}} <b>of</b> Sigmund <b>Freud.</b> His early {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>Freud's</b> psychoanalytic theory {{was instrumental in}} defining the goals and strategies <b>of</b> public relations. <b>Freud</b> theorized that people are motivated by unconscious desires.

25|$|After Adolf Hitler {{took power}} in Germany, Jones helped many {{displaced}} and endangered Jewish analysts to resettle in England and other countries.

25|$|He left a {{reputation}} which has grown steadily both in Britain and internationally. Some commentators consider that his writings are often gnomic and irritating, but never fail to stimulate. He defies categorisation as {{a follower of}} Klein or <b>of</b> <b>Freud.</b> While Bion is most well known outside of the psychoanalytic community {{for his work on}} group dynamics, the psychoanalytic conversation that explores his work is mainly concerned with his theory of thinking, and his model of the development of a capacity for thought.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond the Pleasure Principle may be Freuds most {{controversial}} text. Jacques Lacan, a self-styled Freudian, called it [...] "this extraordinary text <b>of</b> <b>Freuds,</b> unbelievably ambiguous, almost confused". One <b>of</b> <b>Freuds</b> most sympathetic biographers wrote that [...] "Beyond the Pleasure Principle {{is a difficult}} text ... the reassuring intimacy with clinical experience that marks most <b>of</b> <b>Freuds</b> papers, even at their most theoretical, seems faint here, almost absent." [...] He went on to quote Freuds personal physician: [...] "Max Schur, whom no one can accuse <b>of</b> reading <b>Freud</b> unsympathetically, said flatly: We can only assume that Freuds conclusions ... are an example of ad hoc reasoning to prove a preformed hypothesis ... throughout Beyond the Pleasure Principle [...] ".|$|R

25|$|Nonetheless, Sickert's {{paintings}} of the Camden Town Murder series of c. 1906–1909 were painted in heavy impasto and narrow tonal range, as were numerous other obese nudes in the pre-World War I {{period in which the}} fleshiness of the figures is connected to the thickness of the paint—a device that was later adapted by Lucian Freud. The influence of these paintings on successive generations of British artists has been noted in the works <b>of</b> <b>Freud,</b> David Bomberg, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Howard Hodgkin, and Leon Kossoff.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Masters and Johnson the {{clinical}} approach to sexual problems was largely {{derived from the}} thinking <b>of</b> <b>Freud.</b> It was held with psychopathology and approached with a certain pessimism regarding the chance of help or improvement. Sexual problems were merely symptoms of a deeper malaise and the diagnostic approach was from the psychopathological. There was little distinction between difficulties in function and variations nor between perversion and problems. Despite work by psychotherapists such as Balint sexual difficulties were crudely split into frigidity or impotence, terms which too soon acquired negative connotations in popular culture.|$|E
25|$|Crews went on {{to criticize}} Freud and {{psychoanalysis}} extensively, becoming a major figure in the discussions and criticisms <b>of</b> <b>Freud</b> {{that occurred during the}} 1980s and '90s. Crews was {{one of a number of}} critics who requested that a Freud exhibition planned for the Library of Congress be rendered less one-sided; the protests evidently delayed the exhibit's opening by almost a year, and almost cancelled it outright. Author Eli Zaretsky, who identifies Crews as one of Freud's most prominent critics, writes that Crews's challenges to Freud and psychoanalysis have gone largely unanswered. Crews's Freud: The Making of an Illusion was published in August, 2017.|$|E

25|$|He was {{a leading}} member of the Frankfurt School of {{critical}} theory, whose work {{has come to be}} associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works <b>of</b> <b>Freud,</b> Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck made early {{contributions}} to {{fields such as}} personality by express and explicit commitment to a very rigorous adherence to scientific methodology, as Eysenck believed that scientific methodology was required for progress in personality psychology. He used, for example, factor analysis, a statistical method, to support his personality model. An example is Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study, quoted above. His early work showed that Eysenck was an especially strong critic of psychoanalysis {{as a form of}} therapy, preferring behaviour therapy. He was particularly critical <b>of</b> <b>Freud</b> and his methods and wrote a book criticising them entitled Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Boring's self-criticism, fear of failure, {{and need}} for peer-acceptance became unmanageable and {{affected}} the productivity of his work. In 1933, {{at the suggestion of}} his friends and family, Boring began psychoanalysis treatment with a former colleague <b>of</b> <b>Freud,</b> Hanns Sachs. Boring remained in psychoanalysis for a year, five sessions a week, but he found it to be ineffective in alleviating his concerns. Boring had hoped to achieve a change in personality {{by the end of the}} experience and was disappointed to find that he still had his old mindset. Four years later, both Sachs and Boring wrote about the experience in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. The two men agreed that the psychoanalysis was not successful.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{attending}} a congress of neurologists in Amsterdam in 1907, Jones met Carl Jung, {{from whom he}} received a first-hand account of the work <b>of</b> <b>Freud</b> and his circle in Vienna. Confirmed in his judgement {{of the importance of}} Freud's work, Jones joined Jung in Zurich to plan the inaugural Psychoanalytical Congress. This was held in 1908 in Salzburg, where Jones met Freud for the first time. Jones travelled to Vienna for further discussions with Freud and introductions {{to the members of the}} Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Thus began a personal and professional relationship which, to the acknowledged benefit of both, would survive the many dissensions and rivalries which marked the first decades of the psychoanalytic movement, and would last until Freud's death in 1939.|$|E
25|$|In late 1924 or 1925, Spielrein left Moscow. She and her {{daughter}} rejoined her husband Pavel in Rostov-on-Don. As well as probably being disillusioned by her experience in Moscow, Spielrein may have been impelled to return because her husband by now was {{in a relationship with}} a Ukrainian woman, Olga Snetkova (born Aksyuk), and they now had a daughter, Nina. Pavel returned to his wife, and their second daughter Eva was born in 1926. For at least the next decade, Spielrein continued to work actively as a pediatrician, carrying out further research, lecturing on psychoanalysis, and publishing in the west until 1931. In 1929 she presented a vigorous defense <b>of</b> <b>Freud</b> and psychoanalysis at a congress of psychiatry and neuropathology in Rostov, possibly the last person to mount such a defense at a time when psychoanalysis was on the point of being proscribed in Russia.|$|E
25|$|As time {{permits a}} more nuanced, post-feminist view <b>of</b> <b>Freud,</b> {{feminism}} and Deutsch, so too one can appreciate that her central book 'is replete with sensitive {{insight into the}} problems women confront at all stages of their lives'. Indeed, it has been claimed of Deutsch that 'the ruling concerns of her life bear {{a striking resemblance to}} those of women who participated in the second great wave of feminism in the 1970s: early rebellion...struggle for independence and education...conflict between the demands of career and family, ambivalence over motherhood, split between sexual and maternal feminine identities'. In the same way, one may see that 'to cap the parallel, Deutsch's psychoanalytic preoccupations were with the key moments of female sexuality: menstruation, defloration, intercourse, pregnancy, infertility, childbirth, lactation, the mother-child relation, menopause...the underlying agenda of any contemporary women's magazine — an agenda which her writings helped in some measure to create'.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, Jung {{published}} Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (published in English in 1916 as Psychology of the Unconscious) {{making it}} clear that his views were taking a direction quite different from those <b>of</b> <b>Freud.</b> To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis, Jung called it analytical psychology. Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung, Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a secret Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and Hanns Sachs. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of psychoanalytic theory before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the Jarhbuch and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Zürich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.|$|E
25|$|Margaret wanted time to {{consider}} his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. He, {{like many of his}} contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple <b>of</b> <b>Freud.</b> As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted {{in a letter to his}} mother that unconscious impulses might even affect the work of a mathematician. While in Vienna, he visited Wittgenstein in Puchberg, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill's experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes's support he became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{other three}} {{original}} members whom Freud invited to attend, Alfred Adler, Max Kahane, and Rudolf Reitler, were also physicians and all five were Jewish by birth. Both Kahane and Reitler were childhood friends <b>of</b> <b>Freud.</b> Kahane had attended the same secondary school and {{both he and}} Reitler went to university with Freud. They had kept abreast of Freud's developing ideas through their attendance at his Saturday evening lectures. In 1901, Kahane, who first introduced Stekel to Freud's work, had opened an out-patient psychotherapy institute {{of which he was}} the director in Bauernmarkt, in Vienna. In the same year, his medical textbook, Outline of Internal Medicine for Students and Practicing Physicians, was published. In it, he provided an outline of Freud's psychoanalytic method. Kahane broke with Freud and left the Wednesday Psychological Society in 1907 for unknown reasons and in 1923 committed suicide. Reitler was the director of an establishment providing thermal cures in Dorotheergasse which had been founded in 1901. He died prematurely in 1917. Adler, regarded as the most formidable intellect among the early Freud circle, was a socialist who in 1898 had written a health manual for the tailoring trade. He was particularly interested in the potential social impact of psychiatry.|$|E

25|$|The event, {{at which}} Freud was awarded an Honorary Doctorate, {{marked the first}} public {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>Freud's</b> work and attracted widespread media interest. Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist James Jackson Putnam, Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at Harvard, who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions {{over a period of}} four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement <b>of</b> <b>Freud's</b> work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States. When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the American Psychoanalytic Association in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively.
