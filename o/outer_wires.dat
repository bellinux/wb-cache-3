40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to create a finite element model for detailed three-dimensional stress analysis of an overhead optical ground wire (OPGW) typical of those used in transmission lines. The detailed model considers all possible mechanical effects, such as contact, friction, elongation, torsion, and bending for different end conditions. The OPGW under study comprises four components: the external layer of fourteen aluminum alloy wires and ten inner aluminum clad steel wires, which are laid over an aluminum tube that houses a five-groove aluminum spacer. The optical fiber units are inserted in the aluminum spacer grooves. Three-dimensional solid elements are used to model the <b>outer</b> <b>wires,</b> the inner wires, and the aluminum spacer. The central aluminum tube is modeled with shell elements with large strain and deformation kinematics. All possible contacts between the components, with and without friction, are considered in the model. The OPGW is assumed fixed at one end and pulled from the other with a prescribed displacement equivalent to the experimental elongation of 0. 61 % defined for all components. The finite element analysis predicts that the responses of the outer and inner wires are in the linear range, however the aluminum tube and spacer are yielded under the prescribed displacement. Therefore, a multilinear stress-strain law is used in the model. Two scenarios of loading were tested to apply the axial elongation on the wires; either only the central node or all the interior nodes of the wire cross sections are prescribed a maximum axial displacement. Results of the finite element model are compared with those of the experiments performed at IREQ and with the analytical solutions of Machida and Durelli (1973) and Phillips and Costello (1973). The calculated axial forces of the cable in the coarse and fine mesh models are 61 % and 70 % of those predicted by the analytical solutions, respectively. However, the differences in stresses and strains of the coarse mesh model are in the range of ten percent only from the theoretical solutions. The effective modulus of elasticity of the finite element model increases with tension. For the maximum elongation, the effective modulus obtained with the coarse and fine mesh models is 62 % and 70 % respectively of the equivalent modulus of elasticity calculated neglecting all three-dimensional effects. This study shows the reliability and significance of using finite element modeling in predicting the detailed response of a complex cable, for which experiments and theoretical solutions are unable to yield complete results.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis investigated the flexural fatigue behaviour of non-corroded and corroded pretensioned beams and examined the use of externally bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforcement Polymer (CFRP) sheets as a repair technique aimed at restoring the loss in capacity due to corrosion. This was accomplished through an extensive experimental and analytical program. The experimental program was comprised of a material testing phase and a beam testing phase. The material testing phase consisted of testing seventy-two (72) material samples under monotonic and cyclic axial loading, full strand testing, and corrosion measurements of prestressing strands corroded while embedded in concrete prism. Material testing achieved multiple objectives: (a) it identified the rate of accelerated corrosion of the prestressing strands, (b) it quantified {{the distribution of the}} applied nominal tensile force among the seven wires within a single 7 -wire strand in a prestressed strand, (c) it determined the material fatigue properties, and the stress-strain behaviour of the strand wires, and (d) it quantified the stress concentration factor in the prestressing strand due to corrosion. The beam testing involved constructing thirty-seven (37) 3. 6 m long pretensioned T-beams and testing them in a four-point bending configuration. Twelve (12) beams were tested under monotonic loading, and twenty-five (25) beams were tested under cyclic loading. The main testing variables included: the corrosion level, the applied stress range, and a repair or the lack of it. Corrosion resulted in a significant deterioration of the monotonic and fatigue resistance of the beams in comparison to non-corroded beams, and repair using externally bonded CFRP sheet restored all or most of the monotonic and fatigue resistance lost due to corrosion. All beams failed by rupture of the prestressing strand. Inspection of the strand’s fracture surface showed signs of surface fretting. In addition, the fracture profile was similar to that reported by Toribio and Ovejero (2005) for hydrogen induced stress cracking of heavily cold drawn prestressing wires. Strands having corrosion levels of 5 % and 10 % by mass loss exhibited an overall section loss together with distinct deep corrosion pits. In the analysis phase, fatigue data measured from smooth axial samples taken from the centre wire of a prestrssing strand was used to model the fatigue behaviour of the <b>outer</b> <b>wires</b> of the 7 -wire prestressing strand for corroded and non-corroded pretensioned beams. Strain-based fracture mechanics was employed in all the analyses, which included the flexure fatigue behaviour of: non-corroded and corroded single prestressing wires-in-air, a full 7 -wire prestressing strand-in-air, and a non-corroded and corroded 7 -wire prestressing strand in a beam. The mode results correlated well with the observed experimental results. This thesis presents extensive experimental work, along with an in depth fatigue analysis that is based on material fatigue properties obtained from simple single wire cyclic testing. The resulting modelling approach offers a mechanistic explanation of 7 -wire prestressing strand failure under various conditions...|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} made {{with the purpose of}} {{investigating}} the behavior of composite cylinders under the action of bending loads. A theoretical approach is proposed in which several simplifying assumptions are made, and an experimental analysis is carried out with the view of establishing the degree of validity of these assumptions as well as for purposes of investigating the general behavior of the composite cylinders. The principal assumptions made in the theoretical treatment of the problem are: (1) Plane transverse sections remain plane both within the elastic limit of the materials and in the post-yield stages. (2) The steel behaves in accordance with Hooke's Law up to a strain of 2000 microinches per inch (0. 2 %). For higher values of strain, the steel stress has a constant value determined by the " 0. 2 % offset" standard as shown in the figure below. (3) The stress-strain relationship for concrete is as established in "A Study of Combined Bending and Axial Load in Reinforced Concrete Members", University of Illinois Engineering Experiment Station, Bulletin Series No. 399, 1951, by Eivind Hognestad. (4) Concrete has negligible tensile strength. (5) Somastic and wrap coat, component materials in the composite cylinders, have negligible capacity to withstand tension or compression.

VadlaniThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} micro- and macro-scale aspects of solid state fermentation (SSF) for production of cellulolytic enzymes using fungal cultures. Included in the objectives were investigation of effect of physicochemical characteristics of substrate on enzymes production at micro-scale, and design, fabrication and analysis of solid-state bioreactor at macro-scale. In the initial studies response surface optimization of SSF of soybeans hulls using mixed culture of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus oryzae was carried out to standardize the process. Optimum temperature, moisture and pH of 30 ºC, 70 % and 5 were determined following optimization. Using optimized parameters laboratory scale-up in static tray fermenter was performed that resulted in production of complete and balanced cellulolytic enzyme system. The balanced enzyme system had required 1 : 1 ratio of filter paper and beta-glucosidase units. This complete and balanced enzyme system was shown to be effective in the hydrolysis of wheat straw to sugars. Mild pretreatments– steam, acid and alkali were performed to vary physicochemical characteristics of soybean hulls – bed porosity, crystallinity and volumetric specific surface. Mild nature of pretreatments minimized the compositional changes of substrate. It was explicitly shown that more porous and crystalline steam pretreated soybean hulls significantly improved cellulolytic enzymes production in T. reesei culture, with no effect on xylanase. In A. oryzae and mixed culture this improvement, though, was not seen. Further studies using standard crystalline substrates and substrates with varying bed porosity confirmed that effect of physicochemical characteristics was selective with respect to fungal species and cellulolytic activity. A novel deep bed bioreactor was designed and fabricated to address scale-up issues. Bioreactor’s unique design of <b>outer</b> <b>wire</b> mesh frame with internal air distribution and a near saturation environment within cabinet resulted in enhanced heat transfer with minimum moisture loss.

40|$|Lysefjord Suspension Bridge, with a {{main span}} of 446 meters, has had {{problems}} with wire fractures in the main cables. This is reducing the durability of the bridge. Since {{the opening of the}} bridge in December 1997, over 1400 <b>outer</b> <b>wire</b> fractures have been detected. No clear reason for the failure has been found, but some material defects in the wires could be part of the reason. If the wires continue to fracture with the same rate as today, the main cables have to be maintained more often, and maybe changed much earlier than they were planned for in the beginning. Therefore, the bridge should be further analyzed, to detect any other reasons for the wire fractures, and to determine how and when the main cables should be maintained or changed. A new finite element model is created in ABAQUS, and an eigen value analysis of the bridge model is carried out. A brief analysis of the fractures in light of the weather around the bridge is given. The main components of a suspension bridge are described, and analytical calculations are done based on equations from Bleich and Steinman to verify the results from ABAQUS and Alvsat. The bridge behavior during wind loading was briefly checked, and the displacement from wind load, from a 50 year wind speed, on the bridge has been examined. The loading from this wind speed, with coefficients that take into account different angles of the bridge girder, has been created in ABAQUS, through several iterations. The eigenfrequency analysis done in ABAQUS and the analytical calculations give results that are in the same range as the ones from the original analysis done in Alvsat. The result from the analysis of the weather around the bridge in a period with many wire fractures indicates that after a sudden drop in temperature, many wire fractures occur. The critical wind velocity in regard to vortex induced vibrations is 7. 5 m/s for the first vertical symmetric mode, this is a wind speed that can occur around the bridge, and fatigue in the wires could {{be a part of the}} reason for the cable fractures.

[...] The <b>outer</b> layer of <b>wires</b> in the cables was, however, lightly corroded and had to be replaced. [...] Due to severe deterioration, the limestone towers were replaced in 1886 with steel framed versions. [...] These renovations increased the bridge's strength and helped it handle heavier loads for a few more years.|$|R
