5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of a spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg got off the line well and overtook {{teammate}} Hamilton for the lead going into turn one. Coming out of the following turn, Kimi Räikkönen was caught out by heavy wheelspin on his harder tyre compound going side by side and swept to the outside of the track, crashing into Fernando Alonso's McLaren, who was lifted on top of the Ferrari. Both drivers were able to walk away unharmed from the incident. The collision brought out the safety car. At the end of the lap, Daniil Kvyat made a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing, while Will Stevens retired from the race with an oil leak. When the safety car came back into the pit lane <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of lap six, Rosberg was able to defend his lead against Hamilton and quickly built a gap, leading him by 2.3 seconds by lap eleven. Lap twelve saw the second McLaren of Jenson Button retiring with an intake system sensor failure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the east wing, supported by machine guns, {{to enable them to}} target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one {{on the top of the}} keep.|$|E

5|$|England {{also had}} a {{tradition}} of drawing on expert foreign engineers for military engineering; Italians were particularly sought after, as their home country was felt to be generally more technically advanced, particularly {{in the field of}} fortifications. One of these foreign engineers, Stefan von Haschenperg from Moravia, worked on Camber, Pendennis, Sandgate and St Mawes, apparently attempting to reproduce Italian designs, although his lack of personal knowledge of such fortifications impacted poorly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> results. Technical treatises from mainland Europe also influenced the designers of the Device Forts, including Albrecht Dürer's Befestigung der Stett, Schlosz und Felcken which described contemporary methods of fortification in Germany, published in 1527 and translated into Latin in 1535, and Niccolò Machiavelli's Libro dell'art della guerra, published in 1521, which also described new Italian forms of military defences.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the pressurised modules, Mir featured several external components. The largest component was the Sofora girder, a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on Kvant-1. A self-contained thruster block, the VDU, was mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Sofora and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU's increased distance from Mirs axis allowed an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, {{reducing the amount of}} propellant required to orient the station. A second girder, Rapana, was mounted aft of Sofora on Kvant-1. This girder, a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on Mir-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.|$|E
