40|$|This paper gives {{voice to}} the motivations that drove {{thousands}} of Ethnic Nepalis from Bhutan to choose resettlement {{as a solution to}} their neverending plight. Expelled by their own country where they started to be perceived as a source of instability in the 1980 s, the Bhutanese refugees have found refuge in Nepal for the last 20 years, surviving an inhospitable policy reluctant to integrate them. From 2007, the governments of Denmark, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United States started to host the Bhutanese refugees willing to be resettled in a third-country. Since 300 Bhutanese refugees are currently living in Denmark, we decided to interview the 41 resettled in Haslev, a town in Faxe municipality, about 60 km from Copenhagen. Although refugees are generally perceived as a passive <b>object</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance,</b> our findings show people that they are aware of the difficulty to be repatriated, willing to end a life of idleness in the camps, hoping for a better future and craving for citizenship, and hence the refugees have actively chosen to start over in a foreign country despite the hardships that they had to encounter. The resettlement in fact proves to be a long process that does not end with the arrival of refugees, but it actually continues in the host state...|$|R

40|$|Este artigo trata da produção de serviços de saúde mental. O objetivo foi descrever as concepções de serviços de saúde mental de trabalhadores de diferentes serviços de saúde mental do município de São Paulo, que fizeram o curso de especialização em tecnologias em saúde mental. No âmbito hospitalar, ambulatorial e da unidade básica de saúde, a concepção de saúde-doença é multifatorial e centrada no indivíduo. Já no centro de atenção em saúde mental (CAPS), a concepção aproximou-se da teoria da determinação social. Quanto ao processo de trabalho, o objeto recortado foi predominantemente o indivíduo doente e até mesmo o sintoma da doença, distinguindo-se no CAPS uma concepção que relaciona o usuário à sua "rede social". O desafio é avançar o entendimento da concepção do processo saúde-doença e redefinir processos de trabalho, pautados no âmbito dos determinantes e não somente no dos resultados do processo saúde-doença. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> {{this study}} is the {{production}} of mental health service. It is composed by working processes organized to improve the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the health care, through institutions and knowledge, technology and health practices. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the conceptions of the workers of different mental health services on the production of these services. The workers took a specialization course in mental health technologies, financed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Data were collected during a class period, with previous participant’s authorization. Among the workers of the Psychiatry Hospitals, Mental Health Ambulatories and Health Care Units, the conception of the health illness-process was multifactorial and individual centred. At the Psychosocial Attention Center (PAC) the conception appeared to be similar to the theory of the social determination. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assistance</b> was the sick person or even the illness symptom, but PAC workers linked the sick person to his "social net". The challenge is to understand the social determination of the mental health-illness process and to redefine working process, in order to act not only on curing but also on preventing mental health problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{motivated}} by the question <b>of</b> whether development <b>assistance</b> directed at agriculture ("agricultural aid") is effective. It argues that development assistance is continually changing as the ascendant visions of strong global leaders interact with theories of economic growth and evidence {{on the impact of}} past aid, and that agricultural aid has reflected similar continual changes in its composition and mode of delivery. The chapter briefly summarizes evidence on the contribution of aid to overall economic growth, then reviews the evidence of whether agricultural aid accelerates agricultural or economic development. It reviews evaluations of projects and sets of projects related to agricultural credit, integrated rural development, irrigation, research, extension, and higher education. However, except for the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) work, most studies of agricultural aid fail to estimate economic rates of return or contributions to incomes of farmers or national economies. It is impossible to conclude, from the evaluation literature, whether agricultural aid accelerates economic development or not. The chapter shows that donors change the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> their <b>assistance</b> with great frequency. Economic growth takes time, and donors have not stayed committed to key activities for a sufficiently long time to achieve results. Aid to agriculture from nearly all donors fell precipitously beginning in the mid- 1980 s despite clear evidence that there was a continuing need for broad, long-term support for agriculture in sub-Sahara Africa. This review suggests that those with responsibility for allocating assistance across sectors do not understand the crucial importance of agriculture at the early stages of development, because the urge to fund new approaches dominates decisions rather than judgment of what is needed and what is likely to be effective. However, one may also understand the unwillingness of aid decision makers to place too much credence in the results of impact evaluation studies because there are few consistent results, whether on national economic growth or agricultural growth, and most studies stress the difficulty of attributing agricultural production growth to development assistance. development effectiveness; impact evaluation; aid impact; agricultural aid; economic growth...|$|R
