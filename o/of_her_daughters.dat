5|$|The Ashbridge {{family were}} English Quakers {{who lived in}} Chester County, Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century. Jonathan Ashbridge had been disowned by the Chester Meeting some time after the American Revolutionary War and died in Pennsylvania in 1782. Jonathan's wife, Sarah, arrived in Upper Canada in 1793 with her two sons, John and Jonathan, three <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters,</b> and their families. Folklore {{suggests}} they spent their first winter {{in the ruins of}} the old French fort, Fort Rouillé, near present-day Fort York.|$|E

The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed.|$|E
5|$|Neila and her husband, Sathyalingam, {{had three}} daughters and a son. <b>Of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters,</b> her eldest, Mohana (born 1957), sings for Apsaras Arts' performances; while Nandana (born 1960), runs an Indian {{performing}} arts school also called Apsaras Arts in Canberra, Australia.

Her younger son Skanda (born 1963) contracted encephalitis at six months and became severely mentally and physically disabled. Neila's younger sister, Anusha, who lives in Zambia, is a Bharatanatyam dancer and teacher. She died, aged 78, on 9 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters.</b> This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E

5|$|Resident {{killer whales}} {{in the eastern}} North Pacific have a {{particularly}} complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters,</b> etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, {{as many as four}} generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. Her brother-in-law Stephen was heir presumptive {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as heir presumptive and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly took a different course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters,</b> a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-four {{months into}} her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her {{handcuffs}} for periods of time, though they kept her {{locked in the}} bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, they gave her cooked food for the first time. They informed her that they believed that she was pregnant. Age 13 and four-and-a-half months pregnant, Dugard had learned {{of the link between}} sex and pregnancy from television. At this time, while Dugard was raising her baby, Angel, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenage Dugard. Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters</b> using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures.|$|E

5|$|Chicado V started {{only six}} times because knee {{problems}} cut short her racing career. However, she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records, {{and was given}} the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1952. The next year she ran her last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare, and had nine foals. Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and all her foals had a total of seven stakes race wins. One <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters,</b> Table Tennis, {{went on to become}} a noted broodmare herself, as did Table Tennis' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. However, three of ChicadoV's sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—were her best known offspring; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame. She was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Theoktistos' early life. He is called a eunuch in Theophanes Continuatus and al-Tabari and is {{generally}} accepted as such by modern scholars, although an accusation by his rival Bardas of wanting to marry Empress Theodora or one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters</b> appears incompatible with this. By 820 he held an unspecified position at the court of Emperor Leo V the Armenian (ruled 813–822), possibly {{as a member of}} the imperial guard. Theoktistos played a major role in the plot to assassinate Leo, and was rewarded by the new emperor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 822–829), with the rank of patrikios, and the confidential court post of chartoularios tou kanikleiou ("secretary of the ink-pot"). Under Michael's son and successor, Theophilos (r. 829–842), he apparently continued to be a trusted advisor, as he rose to the rank of magistros, and was appointed logothetēs tou dromou, effectively the Empire's foreign minister. A further mark of imperial confidence was Theophilos appointing Theoktistos {{as a member of the}} regency council for his two-year-old son Michael III shortly before his death in January 842, alongside the empress-dowager Theodora, and the magistros Manuel the Armenian.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters.</b> The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

5|$|Under Edward VI John Dudley, Viscount Lisle {{was raised}} to the title of Earl of Warwick, while Edward Seymour, Earl of Hereford became Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector. In October 1549 the Protector lost his power in a trial of {{strength}} with the Privy Council, from which John Dudley, Earl of Warwick emerged as Lord President of the Council {{and leader of the}} government. Somerset, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London, was soon allowed to rejoin the Council. Before his release, the Duchess of Somerset and the Countess of Warwick had arranged daily banquets to reconcile their husbands. A marriage between their respective eldest son and daughter, Anne Seymour and John Dudley, was equally promoted by the two ladies. In June 1550 a grand wedding was staged at the palace of Sheen, attended by the twelve-year-old King Edward. Jane Dudley continued as a great lady at court during the ascendancy of her husband, who became Duke of Northumberland in October 1551. She was influential with him; the financier Thomas Gresham and the diplomat Richard Morrison sought her patronage, and she also interceded for Mary Tudor, who had stood godmother to one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughters</b> in 1545.|$|E
