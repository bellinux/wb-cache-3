25|$|In chapter 96, a myth {{explaining}} Skíðblaðnirs {{creation is}} provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once {{cut off the}} goddess's Sif's hair {{in an act of}} mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and Skíðblaðnir, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.|$|E
2500|$|The priest {{offers the}} host, holding {{it on the}} paten at breast level and praying that, {{although}} he is unworthy, God may accept [...] "this spotless host (or victim, the basic meaning of hostia in Latin) for his own innumerable sins, offences and neglects, for all those present, and for all faithful Christians living and dead, that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned. He then mixes {{a few drops of}} water with the wine, which will later become the Blood of Jesus, and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> offers [...] "the chalice of salvation", asking that it may [...] "ascend with a sweet fragrance." [...] He then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from Dan [...]|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{looked at}} her gravely, with a slight {{hardening}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Winifred saw a drop {{of blood}} ooze out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> and the sight stirred her profoundly.|$|R
6000|$|Cockton {{looked at}} the point <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pencil, and with a hesitating motion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> answered, 'Mr. Somerset said he was tired.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you suppose," [...] said Denham, with a {{peculiar}} curl <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> [...] "that this interview {{will tend to}} improve your chance of obtaining that situation?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sue imperceptibly shrank away, {{her flesh}} quivering under the touch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin bowed, with a {{faint smile}} at the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|He paused thoughtfully, {{and shook}} his head with ominous frowns and bitings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Soames {{raised the}} corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> in a smile, and looked across at Bosinney. The {{architect}} was grinning behind the fumes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cigarette. Now, indeed, {{he looked more}} like a buccaneer.|$|R
6000|$|... "A mere {{waste of}} ammunition," [...] murmured Rosco, with a contemptuous curl <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> as he rose. [...] "But the next {{may be better}} aimed, so I'll bid you good-bye, Redford!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you and I were sane, {{we should}} not be here," [...] thought the pirate captain; but he did not give {{expression}} to the thought, save by a contemptuous curl <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|Major Thomson paused. There was a queer twisted {{smile at}} the corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dredlinton's dull eyes glittered. The slight {{contraction}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{did nothing}} to improve his appearance.|$|E
60|$|Drexley {{looked up}} at her with a grim smile {{twitching}} at the corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{appointment}} of Dugald Drummond as Superintendent of the LSWR after Adams' departure, the class was modified slightly, with the application <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lipped</b> chimney {{in place of the}} stovepipe version that the locomotives were equipped with when built.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{told him}} the whole story, with small changes {{so that he could}} not {{identify}} the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> that there was a struggle going on within him.|$|R
60|$|His folded hands twitched on the hilt. The cigar turned {{faster in}} the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{very rare}} and {{by no means}} {{pleasant}} smile twisted the corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> for a moment.|$|E
60|$|Louis hesitated. There was a {{peculiar}} {{smile at the}} corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> which I did not quite understand.|$|E
6000|$|He {{poked his}} head forward, groping for the ear <b>of</b> <b>his</b> commander. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> touched it--big, fleshy, very wet. He cried in an {{agitated}} tone, [...] "Our boats are going now, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If he's {{a gentleman}} of fashion, {{he will take}} my finger so, just with the tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, and with some {{fluttering}} of the heart, and the least trembling <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> slip the ring so lightly on that I shall hardly know it is there--looking delightfully into my eyes all the time.|$|R
2500|$|... {{localised}} swelling to {{the area}} of the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> upper <b>lip</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Craig {{shook his}} head. A very weak smile of triumph flickered {{for a moment}} at the corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|His {{face lit}} up--she saw his {{thoughts}} go flitting away, and the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> curl in a retrospective smile of pleasure.|$|E
60|$|His {{words were}} not out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> when a {{tremendous}} volley rang out all round them; {{and half the}} franc tireurs fell.|$|E
60|$|That {{was the old}} rider's {{ruthless}} spirit {{speaking out}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter's <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Forsyth Sahib said, [...] "But always. And I wear {{it in the}} Presence when I put on uniform. I am a Colonel in the Armies of Hind." [...] The eldest said, [...] "Of what regiment?" [...] And Forsyth Sahib {{looked on}} the carpet and pulled the hair <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> He saw the trap.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... two {{wounds to}} the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> upper <b>lip</b> which were not {{bleeding}} ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Timothy seemed {{suddenly}} {{very much}} younger. The droop <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{was no longer}} pathetic. There was a little humourous twitch there.|$|E
6000|$|... "One feels {{tempted to}} inquire where Mr. Harding secured this mass of information?" [...] he said, {{with a slight}} curl <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Borrowdean stood up. His tone {{acquired}} a new earnestness. He became at once {{more of a}} man. The cynical curve <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> had vanished.|$|E
60|$|Outside he {{ran into}} Linton. Unlike Drummond, Linton bore marks of the encounter. As {{in the case of}} the hero of Calverley's poem, one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{speaking}} eyes was sable. The swelling <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> was increased. There was a deep red bruise on his forehead. In spite of these injuries, however, he was cheerful. He was whistling when Sheen collided with him.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped talking}} {{for a little}} time and folded his arms tight and stared hard in front <b>of</b> himself, <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> compressed.|$|R
60|$|His passionate {{utterance}} ceased with a snap <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teeth. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> {{set in a}} thin, bitter line. The agitation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face preceded a convulsive wrestling <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulders. All this swift action denoted {{an inner}} combat, and it nearly overwhelmed him.|$|R
