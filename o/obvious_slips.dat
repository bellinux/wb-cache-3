40|$|Dihydroxylammonium 5, 5 ′-bis(tetrazole) - 1, 1 ′-diolate (TKX- 50) is a newly {{synthesized}} {{energetic material}} with high energy storage, low impact sensitivity, and low toxicity. These features {{make it a}} viable candidate to replace such commonly used energetic materials as RDX and CL- 20 {{in the next generation}} of explosives. Sensitivity determines the engineering application of energetic materials (EMs) and has been widely studied for various EMs. To understand the origin of the anisotropic sensitivity and properties of this new synthesized EM, we report a flexible classical force field for TKX- 50 developed to reproduce the molecular properties (geometry, vibrational frequencies and torsion barriers) and the crystal properties (cell parameters and lattice energy). We then used this force field in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict such thermodynamic and mechanical properties as isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion, elastic moduli, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we carried out large scale (∼a half million atoms) MD simulations to investigate the mechanical response to shocks in the [100], [010] and [001] directions. The predicted Hugoniot elastic limits (HELs) are 6. 1 GPa for [100], 14. 2 GPa for [010] and 9. 1 GPa for [001] shocks. Thus, single crystal TKX- 50 shows anisotropic impact sensitivity with [010] as the most sensitive direction and [100] as least sensitive. The plastic deformations in shock compression along the [100] direction primary arise from the (001) /[210] and (010) /[001] slip systems of. For the [010] shock, the primary slip systems are (100) /[021] and (001) /[210]. However, no <b>obvious</b> <b>slip</b> system was observed for [001] shock...|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} local black-on-white tradition, featuring designs {{painted on}} bowl interiors, began with Kwahe’e Black-on-white (AD 1050-1250). This type {{was derived from}} the Cibola tradition and, like that tradition, featured mineral-based black paint and sherd-tempered paste. Hawley (1950:35P called Kwahe'e [...] "An isolated northern Rio Grande form of Escavada Black on White" [...] the Cibola tradition. Habicht-Mauche (1993:15) takes a slightly different view of Kwahe'e: [...] "Clearly an indigenous product, it marks the beginning of a succession of black-on-white types unique to the northern Rio Grande area." [...] She acknowledges, however, [...] "Stylistic influences from the west and northwest" [...] (Habicht-Mauche 1993:15). While Escavada vessels tend to have <b>obvious</b> white <b>slips,</b> Kwahe’e vessels are unslipped or thinly slipped, and the designs are less well executed (Hawley 1950:35; Mera 1935:5-6; Wilson 2005:26).|$|R

40|$|On 3 July 2015, a Mw 6. 4 {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} a blind fault struck Pishan, Xinjiang, China. By combining Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) and other Static Global Positioning System (GPS) sites surrounding Pishan region, it provides a rare chance for us to constrain the slip rupture for such a moderate event. The maximum displacement is up to 12  cm, 2  cm for coseismic and postseismic deformation, respectively, and both the deformation patterns show a same direction moving northeastward. With rectangular dislocation model, a magnitude of Mw 6. 48, Mw 6. 3 {{is calculated based on}} coseismic, postseismic deformation respectively. Our result indicates the western Kunlun range is still moving toward Tarim Basin followed by an <b>obvious</b> postseismic <b>slip</b> associated with this earthquake. To determine a more reasonable model for postseismic deformation, a longer GPS dataset will be needed...|$|R
40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any <b>obvious</b> <b>slipping.</b> By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|R
