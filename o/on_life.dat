5|$|Following Life Is Strange is {{the action}} {{role-playing}} game Vampyr, set for release in Q1/Q2 2018. About 80 staff {{were devoted to}} the development of Vampyr, many of whom worked <b>on</b> <b>Life</b> Is Strange. The studio started developing Life Is Strange 2 in early 2016, after its predecessor had proved financially successful. 2016 saw the origin of a new IP, which Dontnod partnered with publisher Bandai Namco to create. A separate team of senior developers was commissioned, so as not to impede the work <b>on</b> <b>Life</b> Is Strange 2.|$|E

5|$|Scots of the Riverina, a poem {{written by}} one of Australia's most renowned writers, Henry Lawson, is set in Gundagai. The poem {{describes}} a father's anger at his son's desertion at harvest time and later his grief when the son dies in battle in World War I. Hay and Hell and Booligal, written by Banjo Paterson, is a humorous take <b>on</b> <b>life</b> on the flat western Riverina plan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Life's</b> Terms {{marked a}} change in musical style which {{differentiated}} from their previous work. Whereas The Dawn was more influenced by emo lyrics and singing/screaming styles, <b>Life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Life's</b> Terms took a more straight-up rock and pop-rock approach. <b>Life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Life's</b> Terms, while not as widely acknowledged as a release as The Dawn, did garner much more positive reviews. Both CDs feature mild guitar solos in various songs despite the somewhat significant changes in musical stylings.|$|R

5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook <b>on</b> <b>life</b> and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies <b>on</b> <b>life,</b> particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E

During the meeting, Rudy Stagg, a man {{infected}} with POS who had been killing dogs in order to contain the outbreak, stumbles into their room. Rudy ignores pleas to spare Jack and shoots at her, but Logan dives {{in front of the}} dog and is shot instead. Logan suffers a collapsed lung and falls into a coma. He awakens weeks later and learns that Jack is <b>on</b> <b>life</b> support. He says a final goodbye to Jack before her life support is turned off. Jack's immunity to POS leads {{to the creation of a}} vaccine and cure, and Logan is finally able to reconcile with Robert, Craig, and Devon Wallacea childhood enemy whose dog died due to POS. The novel's epilogue, written as a newspaper article, reveals Logan and his family hold a private ceremony to honor Jack.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's {{presentation of}} a woman's view <b>on</b> <b>life</b> and love, along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the group on the album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect <b>on</b> <b>life</b> where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses <b>on</b> <b>life</b> in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher).

5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself.

This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
