5|$|Nowitzki is a {{versatile}} frontcourt player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center and small forward throughout his career. An exceptional shooter for his size, Nowitzki has made 88% of his free throws, nearly 50% of his field goal attempts and nearly 40% of his 3-point shots, {{and won the}} 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout competition. In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% <b>or</b> <b>better</b> from the field, 40% <b>or</b> <b>better</b> on three-pointers, and 90% <b>or</b> <b>better</b> on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.|$|E

5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over {{a large part of}} western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893.

5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, <b>or</b> <b>better</b> yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Sei Shōnagon, {{author of}} The Pillow Book, {{had been in}} service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is {{possible}} that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi's court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon's The Pillow Book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally <b>or</b> <b>better</b> educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi's court in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 <b>or</b> <b>better</b> and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient <b>or</b> <b>better</b> performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
