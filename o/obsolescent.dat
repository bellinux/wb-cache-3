5|$|During World War II, George led the Air Transport Command, {{taking it}} from 130 <b>obsolescent</b> {{aircraft}} to 3,000 modern transports, operated by 300,000 airmen. Following the war, he helped Hughes Aircraft {{become a very}} profitable company, and was twice elected mayor of Beverly Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|The Imperator Aleksandr II-class battleships {{were two}} battleships {{built for the}} Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were {{intended}} to counter the small armored ships of the other Baltic powers. Construction was very prolonged and the ships were virtually <b>obsolescent</b> when completed. They were optimized for ramming.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{was laid}} down at Brest in November 1905 and {{launched}} on 21 September 1907. She {{was completed in}} January 1911 and commissioned into the French fleet. The ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the armored cruiser <b>obsolescent</b> as a warship type.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 Coastal Command had forces of ten Avro Anson, including four auxiliaries, two Vickers Vildebeest, two Short Sunderland, three Saro London and one Supermarine Stranraer squadrons. The Vildebeest and London were all <b>obsolescent.</b> The Ansons made up half of this force, but with insufficient range to undertake deep ocean reconnaissance {{it was left to}} the flying-boat squadrons, of which four out of six had <b>obsolescent</b> machines. This left three squadrons with suitable aircraft, the Lockheed Hudson and Sunderland that could operate effectively. Anson engines were in limited supply in 1939. Moreover, the Sunderland and Hudson airframes were also limited, the later being delivered at a rate of just two per month. To fill the gap in production capacity, the Air Ministry dispatched several missions to the United States to buy more Hudson airframes.|$|E
5|$|New {{organizations}} were formed and new cross ocean routes {{were established in}} the face of the enemy and under difficult conditions. George took the ferrying command from 130 <b>obsolescent</b> aircraft to 3,000 modern military transports, and expanded the personnel from 11,000 to 300,000. For this major contribution to his country, George received the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal, as well as decorations from Great Britain, France, Brazil, Peru and China.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obsolescent</b> {{before she}} entered service, Palestro had an uneventful career. She served {{primarily}} in Italy's colonial empire {{and did not}} see action. In 1880, she took part in an international naval demonstration off Ragusa to enforce the Treaty of Berlin. Palestro was employed {{in the defense of}} La Maddalena from 1889 to 1894, and thereafter as a training ship. She was stricken from the naval register in 1900 and broken up for scrap in 19021904.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obsolescent</b> by the {{beginning}} of World War I, Carlo Alberto was not very active during the war. She spent almost the entire war based in Venice. The ship began conversion into a troop transport there in 1917. This required the removal of her armor, the addition of a new deck and internal modifications to suit her new role. The work was finished in Taranto early the next year; she was recommissioned with the new name of Zenson on 4 April 1918. The ship was discarded on 12 June 1920 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Principe Amedeo {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenale di La Spezia in August 1865, and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 15 January 1872. Fitting-out work proceeded very slowly, and the ship was finally completed on 15 December 1874. <b>Obsolescent</b> {{by the time she}} was completed, Principe Amedeo primarily served in the Italian colonial empire, which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s. She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career.|$|E
5|$|Principe di Carignano {{took part}} in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866, where she led the Italian line of battle, but was not heavily engaged. Rendered <b>obsolescent</b> by the advent of central battery and turret ships in the 1870s, the three Principe di Carignano-class ships did not have {{particularly}} long or active service lives. In an effort to reduce the maintenance budget to offset the cost of newer ships under construction, Principe di Carignano was stricken from the naval register in 1875; Messina and Conte Verde followed in 1880, the latter just nine years after completion.|$|E
5|$|Sailing via Bombay, India, No.3 Squadron {{arrived at}} Suez, Egypt, in late August 1940. In its {{original}} army cooperation role supporting the Australian 6th Division in the North African Campaign, the squadron {{was equipped with}} <b>obsolescent</b> Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Westland Lysander observation aircraft. As part of his unit's work-up for operations, McLachlan organised training exercises with the 6thDivision, as well as written exams to test his men's knowledge of army jargon and air-to-ground communications.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein {{was laid}} down on 18 August 1905 at the Germaniawerft {{dockyard}} in Kiel. She was launched on 17 December 1906, the last pre-dreadnought battleship of the German navy. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5cm) guns—had already been commissioned earlier that month, with a revolutionary design that rendered every battleship of the German navy <b>obsolescent,</b> including Schleswig-Holstein. At Schleswig-Holsteins launching ceremony, she was christened by Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, the German Empress; Wilhelm II {{was also in}} attendance. Ernst Gunther, the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, gave the commissioning speech.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had {{played a role in the}} coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming <b>obsolescent,</b> especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
5|$|Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. During the war, she was involved in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where she provided gunfire support to Italian infantry. The ship was <b>obsolescent</b> by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914–15, but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and, after April 1916, was used primarily as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|B1 {{remained}} at Portsmouth for local defence and training duties through 1916 before being paid off. B3 and B4 {{were transferred to}} Ardrossan {{by the end of}} 1915 to relieve two even more <b>obsolescent</b> A-class boats on local defence duties in the Firth of Clyde. B3 was transferred to Leith during mid-1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull-mounted directional hydrophone system and later sent to Rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a target to train anti-submarine forces or experimental work {{for the rest of the}} war. B4 was paid off before the end of 1916. B5 moved to Portsmouth during 1915 where she too was paid off before the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were <b>obsolescent</b> from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{the first}} {{dreadnought}} battleships began to enter service with the German fleet, rendering older vessels like Brandenburg <b>obsolescent.</b> That year, she temporarily returned to service with the III Squadron {{to take part}} in the annual fleet maneuvers. After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. Brandenburg again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the Marinestation der Ostsee, where she remained inactive for the following two years.|$|E
5|$|Emanuele Filiberto {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912. During the war, she was involved in the assaults on Tripoli in North Africa and on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. She was <b>obsolescent</b> by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 191415, but the need for warships granted Emanuele Filiberto a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of a developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was <b>obsolescent</b> {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on <b>obsolescent</b> heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The keel for Palestro {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} in August 1865. The ship was named for the gunboat , which had been sunk at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. The date of her launch is unknown, though surviving records indicate either 30 September or 2 October 1871. The ship was completed on 11 July 1875, after almost a decade of work. <b>Obsolescent</b> {{by the time she}} was completed, Palestro primarily served in the Italian colonial empire, which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s. She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{construction}} {{period was}} very lengthy, beginning in August 1881 and completing in February 1888. She was quickly rendered <b>obsolescent</b> {{by the new}} pre-dreadnought battleships being laid down and, as a result, her career was limited. She spent her career alternating between the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where she took part in training exercises each year {{with the rest of}} the fleet. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1909 and converted into a floating oil tank. She was used in this capacity until 1943, when she was sunk by bombs during World War II. The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The two ships, which rapidly became <b>obsolescent</b> {{due to the}} {{development}} of central battery ironclads and later turret ships, remained in service until the 1880s, having been modernized with new boilers and guns in the 1870s. Neither ship {{played a role in the}} attack on Civitavecchia in 1870the last stage of the Italian wars of unificationowing to the very poor state of the Regia Marina in the aftermath of Lissa. Formidable served as a gunnery training ship from 1887 to 1903, when she was discarded. Terribile also served as a training ship, beginning in 1885; she was sold for scrap in 1904 and broken up thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to concede that the IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order a batch of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already <b>obsolescent</b> {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} <b>obsolescent</b> cruiser. Rumors that year of a {{potential}} sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
5|$|By 6 April 1941, the VVKJ {{had been}} almost {{completely}} mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighter aircraft, and 100 modern medium bombers. Other than {{a small number of}} locally made Rogožarski IK-3 fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available. The KJRM consisted of a flotilla of river monitors based on the Danube and a small fleet based in several ports along the Adriatic coast. The blue-water navy centred on a flotilla leader, three smaller destroyers, four <b>obsolescent</b> submarines and a gunboat, supplemented by minelayers and torpedo boats. Some of the smaller vessels in the Yugoslav fleet had been inherited from the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I and were obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Celebrations {{to honor}} the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first trans-Atlantic voyage were held in several countries; Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I {{represented}} Austria-Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa, Italy, Columbus's birthplace. While there, she was inspected by King Umberto I of Italy and his son Victor Emmanuel III. Already by 1898, the ship was regarded by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as a second-rate vessel, after less than 10 years in service. The rapid pace of naval development in the late 19th century had quickly rendered her <b>obsolescent.</b> Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was reclassified as a coastal defense ship in 1906. In 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to sell the ship, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, and Tegetthoff to Uruguay {{in an attempt to}} raise funds for new projects, but the deal fell through.|$|E
5|$|During June–September 1917, Bellerophon {{served as}} the junior {{flagship}} of the 4th BS while the regular flagship was being refitted. The Grand Fleet sortied {{on the afternoon of}} 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, Superb and Temeraire were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and Superb became the fleet flagship. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. Bellerophon was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and she became a gunnery training ship in March 1919 at the Nore as the class was <b>obsolescent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Ju 87s {{gave the}} German Army yet more {{valuable}} support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army {{landed on the}} Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (Kampfgruppen) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only <b>obsolescent</b> types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} in, the rowing boats had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion {{grounded}} {{to the north}} of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two <b>obsolescent</b> multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the last}} time that the Hamilcar would be used in combat, but the model did remain in service {{for a number of years}} after the end of the Second World War; they were {{particularly}} useful for transporting large and heavy loads. On 31 December 1945 64 Hamilcars were recorded as being present at RAF Tarrant Rushton, where they were used for routine training exercises. However, in January 1946 a process was begun to dispose of 'surplus' Hamilcars, with 44 moved to disposal facilities and twenty remaining. The remainder continued to be used for routine flying exercises until July, when six more were disposed of due to 'glue deterioration', and by February 1947 only twelve were left in operation. These last few Hamilcars appear to have remained in service until 1950, with several used in airshows and public displays by the RAF, and were ultimately phased out as <b>obsolescent</b> by the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{generally}} had {{a long-standing}} policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States {{and some other}} countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN, which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period. The result was that when war came in 1939, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms. Most equipment was <b>obsolescent</b> {{and had to be}} replaced, and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons, equipment and motor vehicles. Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division, but since a division's war establishment was around 3,000, this was only enough for training. In February 1940, the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes.|$|E
5|$|The keel for Roma {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Cantiere della Foce {{shipyard}} in Genoa in February 1863. She was launched on 18 December 1865, and fitting-out work was finished by May 1869. By the time she entered service, other navies had begun to build casemate ships, rendering Roma <b>obsolescent</b> almost immediately after she was completed. In addition, the Italian naval budget was drastically reduced following the defeat at Lissa in 1866, which reflected a stark decrease in the government's confidence in the fleet. As a result, she saw little use during her career; indeed the budget was reduced so significantly that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, {{as part of the}} wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} five {{ships were}} <b>obsolescent</b> {{by the end}} of the war and most were assigned to secondary roles. Two of the sisters were sent to the Black Sea to support the Whites during the Russian Civil War. One ship ran aground and the crew of the other mutinied after one of its members was killed during a protest against intervention in support of the Whites. Both ships were quickly condemned and later sold for scrap. The remaining three sisters received partial modernizations in the mid-1920s and became training ships until they were condemned in the mid-1930s and later scrapped. The only survivor still afloat at the beginning of World War II in August 1939 had been hulked in 1931 and was serving as part of the navy's torpedo school. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France in 1942 and scuttled by them after the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on <b>obsolescent</b> heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Waldeck-Rousseau, {{named for}} the {{recently}} deceased Prime Minister of France, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, was ordered on 31 July 1905 and was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 16 June 1906. She was launched on 4 March 1908, and fitting out work was completed in time to begin sea trials in January 1911. While on her acceptance trials on 2 February, she struck a submerged object that bent her port propeller shaft and damaged the screw. Waldeck-Rousseau was completed in August; the ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the armored cruiser <b>obsolescent</b> as a warship type. Her lengthy construction interfered with the scheduled keel-laying for the new predreadnought battleship Mirabeau, which could not be started until Waldeck-Rousseau was launched. After entering service the new cruiser was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Toulon.|$|E
