25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> {{the capability to}} maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
40|$|Large {{prospective}} {{studies of}} Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) {{have sought to}} understand the pathological evolution of AD and factors that may influence the rate of disease progression. Estimates of rates of cognitive change are available for 12 or 24 months, but not for shorter time frames (e. g., 3 or 6 months). Most clinical drug trials seeking to reduce or modify AD symptoms have been conducted over 12 - or 24 -week periods. As such, we aimed to characterize {{the performance of a}} group of healthy <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> AD on the CogState battery of tests over short test–retest intervals. This study recruited 105 healthy <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> 48 <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> aMCI, and 42 <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> AD from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study and administered the CogState battery monthly over 3 months. The CogState battery of tests showed high test–retest reliability and stability in all clinical groups when participants were assessed over 3 months. When considered at baseline, the CogState battery of tests was able to detect AD-related cognitive impairment. The data provide important estimates of the reliability, stability, and variability of each cognitive test in healthy <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> aMCI, and <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> AD. This may potentially be used to inform future estimates of cognitive change in clinical trials...|$|R

Therefore vision was found to be correlated with general memory function in older adults and is not modality specific.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{effective}} in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments {{for the state}} subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100%–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250%–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200%–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that [...] "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident {{will be able to}} purchase health insurance for $175 per month." [...] But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: With a {{substantial}} increase in diagnosed Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, it is of great importance to examine tolerance and physical measures of evolving exercise interventions. Of particular importance, a multifaceted exercise intervention combining active-assisted cycling and resistance training to <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease is being assessed. METHODS: Fourteen <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and ten healthy <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> (67. 5 ± 7. 9 years of age) engaged in an 8 -week, 24 -session, multifaceted exercise protocol. The protocol consisted of both active-assisted cycling and resistance training. Tolerance was measured, as well as multiple indicators of health-related physical fitness. These indicators examined improvements in cardiovascular performance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility. RESULTS: Twenty-two <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> and <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease tolerated the intervention by completing all 24 sessions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant (P ≤ 0. 003) improvements in cardiovascular performance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility for both groups of individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The multifaceted intervention is the first to combine both active-assisted cycling and resistance training. The <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> and the <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease exhibited both tolerance and health-related improvements in physical fitness following the intervention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Generalized anxiety {{disorder}} (GAD) among the <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> {{is characterized by}} excessive worries and major anxiety. The impairment and disability resulting from GAD indicates a significant mental health problem in long term care settings. In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM- 1 V) GAD is 5. 1 % to 11. 9 %. Evidence-based treatment for GAD in the <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> becomes a challenge due to the concern of frailty, comorbidity and drug side effects. Purpose: To implement the utilization of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in the <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> population <b>with</b> GAD in a long-term care setting. Method: Based on an extensive review of research, a project was designed and conducted to offer the basic knowledge of CBT to nurses {{for the treatment of}} GAD. Outcome evaluation was based on post-implementation questionnaire. Conclusion: The nurse participants were clear that they valued CBT and perceived it helpful for the <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> <b>with</b> GAD, but they needed to be trained proper and increase utilization of CBT.
