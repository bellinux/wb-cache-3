5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity.</b> Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make {{up the majority of}} consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language fall into this category.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin and}} <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> telangiectasias are {{visually}} identifiable on physical examination, and similarly the lesions {{in the nose}} may be seen on endoscopy of the nasopharynx or on laryngoscopy. The severity of nosebleeds may be quantified objectively using a grid-like questionnaire in which the number of nosebleed episodes and their duration is recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapy and {{radiation}} therapy are fundamental treatments for malignancies. Due to these cancer therapies, patients {{have a greater}} predisposition towards mucositis and oral candidiasis. Oral candidiasis is caused by Candida species. Not much {{is known about the}} effect that cancer treatments have on the virulence determinant and antimicrobial sensitivity of C. albicans isolated from the <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of cancer patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of cancer treatment on the virulence and antifungal sensitivities of C. albicans isolated from the <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy in a South African tertiary hospital...|$|R

5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their <b>oral</b> <b>cavity.</b> Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, <b>oral</b> <b>cavity,</b> and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity.</b> Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that orally derived volatile aromatic amines may be of possible diagnostic use and may con-tribute to the etiology or pathogenesis of periodontal dis-ease. Using gas chromatography and gas chromatogra-phy/mass spectrometry, we identified and quantitated pyridine and picolines in the headspace of incubated whole saliva from healthy and diseased subjects. The oral health of subjects was evaluated by four standard oral-health Indices. Volatile aromatic amines were virtually absent from subjects with healthy <b>oral</b> <b>cavities,</b> but were present in the <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of subjects with periodontitis to the extent of 636. 4 (SEM 154. 7) ng/ 5 mL of saliva.

25|$|S. mutans {{is often}} {{acquired}} in the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> subsequent to tooth eruption, but has also been detected in the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> of predentate children.

25|$|Both {{the lungs}} {{and the skin}} serve as {{respiratory}} organs in amphibians. The ventilation of the lungs in amphibians relies on positive pressure ventilation. Muscles lower {{the floor of the}} <b>oral</b> <b>cavity,</b> enlarging it and drawing in air through the nostrils into the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity.</b> With the nostrils and mouth closed, the floor of the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> is then pushed up, which forces air down the trachea into the lungs. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialised cells, and is involved in cutaneous respiration. While the lungs are of primary organs for gas exchange between the blood and the environmental air (when out of the water), the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.|$|E
25|$|A {{compound}} fracture {{is one that}} communicates with the external environment. In the case of mandibular fractures, communication may occur through {{the skin of the}} face or with the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity.</b> Mandibular fractures that involve the tooth-bearing portion of the jaw are by definition {{compound fracture}}s, because there is at least a communication via the periodontal ligament with the <b>oral</b> <b>cavity</b> and with more displaced fractures there may be frank tearing of the gingival and alveolar mucosa.|$|E

50|$|Jaw muscles do not display very {{prominent}} changes in muscular tissue with age in healthy elderly, as their <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> are in constant motor movement (i.e.: performing {{tasks such as}} talking and chewing etc.).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the diversity and ecology of members of the family Pasteurellaceae in the porcine respiratory tract. A collection of 132 V factor-dependent strains of Pasteurellaceae selected from porcine field isolates mainly from the respiratory tract were subjected to detailed characterization. In addition to the three hitherto recognized species Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis, and Haemophilus taxon "minor group," three distinct taxa were observed. Some of these taxa, which are provisionally designated taxa D, E, and F, would by traditional criteria be mistaken for H. parasuis but differed by several biochemical characteristics. To study the ecology of the V factor-dependent species, swabs from the nasal and <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of 29 pigs were cultivated on selective and nonselective media. By studying approximately 30 isolates from each sample, the distribution and relative proportion of the individual taxa were determined. A. pleuropneumoniae was detected in samples from the tonsil areas of only two acutely ill animals. H. parasuis was isolated from the nasal cavities of four out of nine healthy pigs but from the <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of only two animals. In contrast, taxon "minor group" and taxa D, E, and F were present in the <b>oral</b> <b>cavities</b> of the majority of pigs but were not detected in samples from their nasal cavities. The results indicate that all the observed V factor-dependent species of Pasteurellaceae except A. pleuropneumoniae, are members of the resident microflora of various mucosal surfaces of the porcine upper respiratory tract...|$|R
