5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of <b>oxygen</b> <b>content,</b> with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>content</b> of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>content</b> of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E

5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased <b>oxygen</b> <b>content,</b> elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding.

40|$|To {{identify}} the possible reaction mechanism of carbon-based catalysts for the isobutane direct dehydrogenation (DDH) reaction, {{a series of}} modified ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with different surface <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> were prepared and employed as representative catalysts.

According to the characterization results, the treatments have significantly influenced the surface properties, while no obvious change was observed in their pore structure. The differences of surface properties due to the different treatments, and the changes in pore structure and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> after being used as catalysts, were employed to {{identify the}} possible active sites in the carbon catalyzed direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of isobutane.

40|$|Surface tension {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on Fe-C-S-O alloys using the sessile drop technique at 1823, 1873, and 1923 K in a purified argon atmosphere. The experimental data indicate lowering of surface tension values for alloys with low carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> relative to the corresponding ternary Fe-S-O system of comparable compositions. The data exhibit an increasing trend of the surface tension values {{as a function of}} carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> and temperature of the melt. Modified Butler&# 39;s equations have been used in conjunction with the consistent thermodynamic relations for a dilute quaternary system to calculate the surface tensions and adsorption functions of the system. The calculated values are in excellent agreement with those of the experimental data for compositions having lower oxygen at 1823 K, however, the values for the alloys containing higher <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> depart from those of the experimental data. The calculated surface tension values agree within 150 mN/m with those of the experimental data at 1873 K.

5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in a bell, to decompression from saturation, which generally occurs in a decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable <b>oxygen</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower <b>oxygen</b> <b>content.</b> This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased <b>oxygen</b> <b>content</b> and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The proper {{control of}} total {{impurities}} and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> of oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper prepared by vacuum high-frequency melting technique was studied using Mahalanobis-Distance (MD) outlier detection method as functions of raw material purities, vacuum pressure, melting temperature and holding time. The properties of vacuum-melted OFHC copper was examined by thermo-gravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, hardness test, macro and optical microstructure analyses and ultimate tensile test. In multivariate systems, {{the existence of}} outlier {{makes it difficult to}} analyze the system and oultier detection belongs to the most important tasks in experimental data analysis. Mahalanobis Distance is most commonly used as a diagnosis of existance of outlier in multivariate system. The relationship between experiment conditions and total impurities and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> can be defined with the regression analysis results. At this research, our desirable manufacturing conditions is to obtain the total impurities under 40 ppm and <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> under 5 ppm.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technological}} progress in recent years, a new challenge was passed onto decorative hard coatings. While enhancing the appearance and lending attractive coloration to surfaces, the films are supposed to provide scratch resistance, protection against corrosion and durability. For this work, TiN(O) and TiN(C,O) thin films were prepared. Within the TiN(O) system, film colours varied from the glossy golden type for low <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents</b> to dark blue for higher <b>oxygen</b> <b>contents.</b> In order to reach darker colours (black), TiN(C,O) thin films were deposited, and results revealed the possibility to deposit very dark black films.

5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with <b>oxygen</b> <b>content</b> above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased <b>oxygen</b> <b>content,</b> brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E

In the underdoped region, at nh= 0. 11, the examined compounds show a peak in dTc/dp which is very pronounced for systems with well ordered CuO chains. As this peak occurs at the same nh in all investigated systems it is not caused by oxygen ordering, but its origins might {{be found in a}} strong influence of lattice deformations on the electronic structure.
