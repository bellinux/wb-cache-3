5|$|In his 1905 paper naming Albertosaurus, Osborn {{described}} {{two additional}} tyrannosaur specimens {{that had been}} collected from in Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named Dynamosaurus imperiosus ("emperor power lizard"), and the second, Tyrannosaurus rex ("king tyrant lizard"). A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens actually {{came from the same}} species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name Tyrannosaurus had appeared one page earlier in his <b>original</b> <b>article</b> describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name Tyrannosaurus was used.|$|E

40|$|Aims and method: To {{determine}} female authorship of <b>original</b> <b>articles</b> and editorials between January 1997 and December 2008 in the British Journal of Psychiatry and the Psychiatric Bulletin. Editorials from Advances in Psychiatric Treatment and {{the geographical}} {{region of the}} female first author of <b>original</b> <b>articles</b> were {{also included in the}} study. Results: The gender was determined for 99. 2 % of the 2324 first authors of <b>original</b> <b>articles</b> and 100 % of the 614 editorials. The percentage of <b>original</b> <b>articles</b> by female first authors fluctuated over the study period, ranging from 22. 5 to 42. 1 % (mean 33. 6) in the British Journal of Psychiatry, and from 25. 5 to 46. 8 % (mean 37. 6) in the Psychiatric Bulletin. There was a gross underrepresentation of females as first authors of editorials in all three journals. The percentage of female first authors of <b>original</b> <b>articles</b> from low- and middle-income countries ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 4 % in both the British Journal of Psychiatry and the Psychiatric Bulletin. Clinical implications: There is an increasing trend in female first authorship of <b>original</b> <b>articles.</b> However, females remain underrepresented, especially in editorials, in the British psychiatric journals examined. The representation of female first authors from low- and middle-income countries is disproportionately low. Strategies to address these inequalities should be implemented. Declaration of interest: M.

25|$|Turing's <b>original</b> <b>article</b> {{describes}} a simple party game involving three players.

In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B, and can communicate with them only through written notes. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the metric}} {{proposed}} by Alcubierre {{is consistent with}} the Einstein field equations, it may not be physically meaningful, in which case a drive will not be possible. Even if it is physically meaningful, its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed. The proposed mechanism of the Alcubierre drive implies a negative energy density and therefore requires exotic matter. So if exotic matter with the correct properties can not exist, then the drive could not be constructed. However, at the close of his <b>original</b> <b>article</b> Alcubierre argued (following an argument developed by physicists analyzing traversable wormholes) that the Casimir vacuum between parallel plates could fulfill the negative-energy requirement for the Alcubierre drive.|$|E

25|$|Köhler's {{groundbreaking}} work on microscope illumination {{was published}} in the Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Mikroskopie in 1893 in Germany, followed by an English summary of his work in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society one year later. Its significance was not noted until several years later when Köhler was invited to join the Carl Zeiss AG company based on his invention. A century after its first publication, a translation of Köhler's <b>original</b> <b>article,</b> A New System of Illumination for Photomicrographic Purposes, was reprinted in the Köhler Illumination Centenary commemorative issue by the Royal Microscopical Society in 1994.

25|$|The <b>original</b> <b>Article</b> 22H of the Constitution {{provided}} the President with personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill (other than {{a bill to}} which Article 5(2A) applies) which provided directly or indirectly for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon the President by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A) provided that the President could prevent Parliament from passing a bill seeking to amend certain specified clauses of the Constitution, including those dealing with the President's powers, unless it had been supported by not less {{than two-thirds of the}} votes cast at a national referendum. However, as Article 5(2A) was not yet in force, a question arose as to whether the Government was entitled to amend the Constitution in a way that circumvented or curtailed the President's discretionary powers, or whether Article 22H prohibited this entirely.|$|E
25|$|Aware that Lenihan {{had been}} one of Duffy's sources for the <b>original</b> <b>article</b> in September, with Duffy's {{permission}} the Irish Times ran a front-page story stating that Lenihan had made the calls he was now denying. In the resulting furore Lenihan's campaign manager Bertie Ahern either deliberately or accidentally revealed on a radio programme that Duffy had interviewed Lenihan. Duffy became the subject of mounting political and media pressure, with his silence being spun by Fianna Fáil press staff as evidence that the rumours that Lenihan had confirmed to him that he had made calls were false. (Lenihan had assured his campaign team that he had said nothing in the interview that could cause problems.) After three days of intense political and media pressure, Duffy released the relevant proportion of the on-the-record tape interview he had done with Lenihan. The release took place in a press conference in a Dublin hotel.|$|E

25|$|Triggers are {{reminders}} {{that may be}} explicit or implicit about {{the performance of a}} behavior. Examples of triggers can be alarms, text messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the <b>original</b> <b>article</b> does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy.|$|E
