50|$|In {{projective}} geometry Qvist's theorem, {{named after the}} Finnish mathematician Bertil Qvist, is a statement on ovals in finite projective planes. Standard examples of ovals are non-degenerate (projective) conic sections. The theorem gives {{an answer to the}} question How many tangents to an <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> pass through a point in a finite projective plane? The answer depends essentially upon the order (number of points on a line −1) of the plane.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{examples}} of Plücker and of Blum and Guinand, the Trott curve has four separated ovals, the maximum number for a curve of degree four, and hence is an M-curve. The four <b>ovals</b> <b>can</b> be grouped into six different pairs of ovals; for each pair of ovals there are four bitangents touching both ovals in the pair, two that separate the two ovals, and two that do not. Additionally, each oval bounds a nonconvex region of the plane and has one bitangent spanning the nonconvex portion of its boundary.|$|R
50|$|The anticyclones in Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{are always}} confined within zones, {{where the wind}} speed increases in direction from the equator to the poles. They are usually bright and appear as white <b>ovals.</b> They <b>can</b> move in longitude, but stay at approximately the same latitude as {{they are unable to}} escape from the confining zone. The wind speeds at their periphery are about 100 m/s. Different anticyclones located in one zone tend to merge, when they approach each other. However Jupiter has two anticyclones that are somewhat different from all others. They are the Great Red Spot (GRS) and the Oval BA; the latter formed only in 2000. In contrast to white ovals, these structures are red, arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet's depths. On Jupiter the anticyclones usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms (see below), although large <b>ovals</b> <b>can</b> result from the instability of jets. The latter was observed in 1938-1940, when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone; they later merged to form Oval BA.|$|R
50|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the oval}} concept is an abstract oval, which is a structure {{that is not necessarily}} embedded in a projective plane. Indeed, there exist abstract <b>ovals</b> which <b>can</b> not lie in any projective plane.|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{frequent}} {{events are}} noctilucent clouds near {{the pinnacle of}} summer, {{which can only be}} seen outside of the city. These are ice clouds which are situated much above normal cloud layers at 80 km or so. They have a neon-blue like, beautiful appearance. Another astronomical phenomenon is the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights). These in fact occur every year on a few days, but rarely are spectacular. Once in every 10-12 years, the auroral <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be pushed even south of the city and a corona can be seen. The cloudy climate prevents sightings on many occasions, so spectacular displays as said are pretty year and tend to focus near sunspot maxima on the sun.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} an outfield {{combined}} road course {{can be seen at}} the Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne, Australia. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119 mi (1.801 km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which utilise the oval track's start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used. Unfortunately this configuration was only used twice (both in 1987) and has not been used for major motor racing since hosting Round 9 of the 1987 World Touring Car Championship.|$|E

30|$|During {{the current}} period of solar maximum, {{there is concern}} within the GPS {{community}} regarding GPS receiver performance during periods of intense geomagnetic substorms. Such storms are common in the high latitude auroral region, and are associated with small-scale scintillation effects, which can cause receiver tracking errors and loss of phase lock. The auroral <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> extend many degrees equatorward under active ionospheric conditions, with an impact on precise positioning applications in Canada, the United States and Northern Europe. In this paper, a study of receiver tracking performance is conducted during periods of auroral substorm activity. Dual frequency observations are obtained using codeless and semicodeless GPS receivers (Trimble 4000 SSi, NovAtel MiLLennium and Ashtech Z- 12), and performance comparisons are established and interpreted with respect to GPS availability at solar maximum and the years beyond.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the auroral oval pattern, i. e., location, size, shape, and intensity, and the auroral electrojet activity index (AE index) is studied. It is found that the maximal auroral intensity is elliptically distributed, and the lengths of semimajor and semiminor axes are positively correlated to AE. The intensity along the normal of the auroral <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be satisfyingly described by a Gaussian distribution, and the maximum and the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian distribution are both positively correlated to AE. Based on these statistical results, a series of experimental formulas {{as a function of}} AE are developed to calculate the location, size, shape, and intensity of the auroral oval. These formulas are validated by the auroral images released by SWPC/NOAA. Key words: auroral oval, AE index (auroral electrojet activity index), linear correlation. 1...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{characteristic}} functions of classical `crisp' sets {{can be made}} fuzzy {{by means of a}} B_κ-function that we have recently introduced, and where the fuzziness parameter κ∈R controls how much a fuzzy set deviates from the crisp set obtained in the limit κ→ 0. A theorem is established that yields novel expressions for the union, negation, and intersection of both classical and fuzzy sets. As an application, we establish a theorem on the shaping of limit cycle oscillations far from bifurcations in smooth deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems governed by differential equations. We describe two specific examples showing how, with help of fuzzy sets, limit cycles with the shape of ellipses and Cassinian <b>ovals</b> <b>can</b> be mathematically designed. Finally, as a corollary to our theorem, we briefly sketch a generalization of the Stuart-Landau equation to non-sinusoidal oscillators. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Auroral {{displays}} in the noon sector were examined by using hundreds of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program auroral images, {{taken over the}} southern polar region in austral winters, {{in order to determine}} the morphology. The auroral {{displays in}} the midday part of the auroral <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be grouped into five characteristic types, depending on the geomagnetic activity and the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. An important characteristic is the clear disconnection in appearance between the noonside and the nightside discrete auroras. Also, there is the lack of correlation between the concurrent nightside substorm activity and midday discrete auroral activity. Thus, the occurrence of bright, discrete auroras in the midday oval may be caused by the local injection of the magnetosheath plasma into the dayside boundary layer. The observed discontinuity of discrete auroras between the dayside and the nightside ovals is consistent with the existence of two separated major injection regions along the auroral oval: the dayside cusp and the nightside plasma sheet...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to aurora (associated with increased electron densities inside arcs), many {{other kinds of}} plasma structures exist in the ionosphere. As mentioned in the previous section, one such large-scale structure is the auroral oval itself. Both the poleward and equatorward boundaries of the oval are important boundaries in space {{as well as in}} the upper atmosphere. Several statistical models exist to predict their locations, but instantaneous positions may still vary a lot. Experimentally, the <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be imaged by high-altitude polar-orbiting satellites. However, at the moment, no such satellite is in operation. Several other local methods, e.g. utilising satellite particle or radar measurements, exist; specifically, the low-elevation EISCAT VHF radar measurement of electron temperature has been used for detecting the poleward boundary of the oval, which demarcates the polar cap (see e.g. the short summary in Aikio et al. 2006; Woodfield et al. 2010). Depending on the geographic location of EISCAT_ 3 D and magnetic activity conditions, the radar could contribute to the detection of either of the boundaries. Ground-based networks of optical instruments are an important complement for these studies. Support for such measurements ideally requires low elevations to the north and south to maximise spatial coverage. Note that it was a requirement of the EISCAT_ 3 D antenna and array design that the gain reduction should be as small as possible for elevations up to 60 ° off zenith. The report by Johansson et al. (2014) shows the gain performance that can be achieved for the designs under consideration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermospheric mean {{vertical}} winds from high-resolution Fabry-Perot Spectrometer {{observations of}} the λ 630 nm emission (from ∼ 240 km altitude), over a four year interval 1997 – 2000, from Mawson (67. 6 ◦ S, 62. 9 ◦ E, Inv 70. 5 ◦ S) and Davis (68. 6 ◦ S, 78. 0 ◦ E, Inv 74. 6 ◦ S) are presented. Combining the four years of data shows Maw-son mean hourly vertical winds vary between − 10 m s− 1 and + 4 m s− 1, while Davis mean hourly vertical winds vary between − 10 m s− 1 and + 10 m s− 1. Mean hourly vertical winds from Mawson show little change with Kp, while at Davis the range of variation increases with increasing ge-omagnetic activity. Histograms of frequency distributions of such winds, and their variations with Kp and λ 630 nm emission intensity, are presented and discussed. Variations in mean hourly thermospheric winds and λ 630 nm emission in-tensities show at least three significant associations between mean vertical winds and the auroral oval. Mean vertical winds within the auroral oval are smaller than those outside the oval, particularly those in the polar cap. A downward wind associated with entry of the observing region into the auroral <b>oval</b> <b>can</b> be seen in both Mawson and Davis hourly mean vertical winds. Large vertical winds are seen poleward of the auroral oval/polar cap boundary, most significantly up-ward winds occur within ± 2 hr of magnetic midnight. Un-der moderately quiet geomagnetic conditions Davis passes through the auroral oval into the polar cap in the evening, but at higher Kp it passes into the polar cap earlier and larger, and more sustained mean vertical winds are observed.

In the middle layer, a PD facilitator helps a teacher to learn ways of helping students learn the content in the classroom. In the third layer, a researcher/program designer works with the PD facilitators to help them to learn how to help teachers to help students to learn. Because there is little systematic research focusing on the teaching and learning of PD facilitators, researchers and program designers often reach into “lower” levels of the diagram to appropriate ideas, tools, and resources to guide their work.|$|R
