5|$|At Trenton, {{the highway}} crosses the Trent Canal {{and returns to}} an {{agricultural}} setting. It then crosses the Moira River as it goes through Belleville before heading eastward to Kingston. The Kingston portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> originally named the Kingston-Bypass, {{was one of the}} first sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> to be completed; it is now mostly three lanes each way.|$|E

5|$|M-95 was {{previously}} designated as M-45. The number was switched when US45 was designated in Michigan. The trunkline incorporates {{a portion of}} the former M-12 which became US2.

5|$|Beginning in 1991, Highway61 was {{completely}} reconstructed south of Thunder Bay {{to the border}} {{in preparation for the}} 1995 World Nordic Ski Championships. This involved replacing eight bridges, improving sightlines, and adding five passing lanes and paved shoulders throughout the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> from the Indianaâ€“Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the state}} line near Michiana and the {{interchange}} with I-94 near New Buffalo, US12 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT). The full length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in the state is also a Pure Michigan Historic Byway. Outside of the various cities, most of US12 is a rural, two-lane state highway. One section runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti. From there eastward, the US12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area. The entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|By 1951, {{the highway}} had been reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, {{and it had}} been upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, the road in the location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an alternate routing to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, the highway had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E
5|$|By1929, the {{construction}} had reached Lawrence Township, where another {{long stretch of}} highway was built. During1930, {{the construction}} had reached Clinton, Glen Gardener, and Washington. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October1931. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in1932. The route, although the construction had reached its northern end, was not complete due to bypasses around Clinton and Pennington were proposed to be built. These bypasses were never constructed, and during1934, more portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in Hunterdon County were finished. The route was completed in1935, providing an uninterrupted route from {{the capital city of}} Trenton to northern Warren County.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, M-26 was rerouted through Dakota Heights, {{bisecting}} it. Park Avenue had formerly {{served as}} the main route from Houghton to Atlantic Mine, but this {{was replaced by the}} new route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2003, 38years after Robarts' naming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> a Member of Provincial Parliament {{attempted}} {{to get the}} Macdonald-Cartier Freeway highway name enshrined into law; the bill only passed first reading and was not enacted.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1971, several {{consecutive}} days of heavy rainfall led to flooding throughout the area. Several highways {{in the area}} were damaged, including RE 2. Portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> were completely washed out, which took about two weeks to repair.|$|E
