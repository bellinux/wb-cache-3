5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use <b>of</b> <b>Swiss</b> air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E

Interhandel had become cash-rich when a dispute concerning GAF Materials Corporation, a subsidiary formerly known as General Aniline & Film and seized by the U.S. government during the war, was resolved in 1963 and the subsidiary was disposed of.|$|E

5|$|During the Early Modern period <b>of</b> <b>Swiss</b> history, {{the growing}} {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families {{combined with a}} financial crisis {{in the wake of}} the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653.

5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty <b>of</b> <b>Swiss</b> airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to Hampstead Village, and indeed this appeared on some maps.

5|$|Thomas Brunner {{was born}} in Oxford, England, in April 1821, and baptised four months later on 22 August.

The Brunner family were active in the Oxford community, Thomas' parents raising him and his siblings to appreciate cultural and charitable activities.

5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight {{alongside}} the French {{in the name of}} the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much <b>of</b> <b>Swiss</b> politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's time as {{the pastor}} of Glarus and Einsiedeln was {{characterized}} by inner growth and development. He perfected his Greek and he took up the study of Hebrew. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which {{he was able to}} draw upon classical, patristic, and scholastic works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle <b>of</b> <b>Swiss</b> humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative pacifism and his focus on preaching {{can be traced to the}} influence of Erasmus.|$|E
