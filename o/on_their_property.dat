5|$|In German-occupied Poland {{the task}} of rescuing Jews was {{especially}} difficult and dangerous. All household members were punished by death if a Jew was found concealed in their home or <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property.</b> It is estimated {{that the number of}} Poles who were killed by the Nazis for aiding Jews was as high as tens of thousands, 704 of whom were posthumously honored with medals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{farmers in}} central Washington build dams <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property</b> for {{irrigation}} and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated {{there may be}} as many as a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the twelfth}} century, in {{contrast}} to England, there were few parish churches in Scotland. Churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area, often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint. From this period local lay landholders, perhaps following the example of David I, began to adopt the continental practice of building churches <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property</b> for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest. The foundation of these churches began in the south, spreading to the north-east and then the west, being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274. The administration of these parishes was often given over to local monastic institutions in {{a process known as}} appropriation. By the time of the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century 80 per cent of Scottish parishes were appropriated.|$|E

5|$|The state underage {{drinking}} {{statute is}} a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is punishable {{by up to}} 6 months in jail (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month suspension of the person's driver's license. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property,</b> or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property</b> into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>property.</b> The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
